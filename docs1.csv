d802,"madres sofia kourtesis electronic madres is, unsurprisingly, dedicated to kourtesis' mother. more surprising though it is also dedicated to world-renowned neurosurgeon peter vajkoczy. the story of how a world-renowned neurosurgeon came to appear in the liner notes of this record is one of tenacity, miracles, all-consuming love and ultimately, of hope. when she began work on her debut, kourtesis was seemingly unstoppable. a string of rapturously received eps and singles made her one of the fastest rising stars in the electronic world and beyond. she has already graced the cover of mixmag, released a brilliantly energetic and moving resident advisor ‘ra session’, appeared on ‘end of year’ lists from the likes of the new york times, pitchfork, dj mag and spotify (#6 best electronic song) and played instant sell-out early shows at london’s lafayette and manchester’s yes as well as standout performances at glastonbury, green man, wide awake and primavera and tours supporting caribou and bicep. in amongst touring and working though, kourtesis was rushing home to peru at any opportunity to be with her mother, who some months after the passing of her father – the subject of kourtesis’ breakout single ‘la perla’ – had been diagnosed with cancer and was deteriorating rapidly. ""doctors were all the time calling me to say goodbye to her, for months"", she recalls. refusing to lose hope, kourtesis had spoken to every doctor she could get hold of and all of them told her chances were low, operation was too risky. having read about vajkoczy but knowing he was in incredibly high demand, in desperation she posted a music snippet on social media, promising to dedicate the track to vajkoczy for just a few minutes of his time. unbelievably he responded and agreed to meet. vajkoczy agreed to operate. the operation was a success and kourtesis’s mother’s life is extended further than anyone could have possibly hoped. with her mother now well and living nearby in berlin, kourtesis had her life back. madres is the product of that life. though it contains shades of the struggle of those years and her own mental health journey, madres is joyful, awash with warm light and brimming with ""hope and the value that big love can create miracles"". it’s filled with the minutiae of life that kourtesis didn’t have time or energy for; going out with friends, dating, dancing, eating, living. vaikoczy became part of this world, an avid music fan himself he became something of a sounding board for the album and kourtesis even took him on his first trip to berghain."

d2104,"antarctica glåsbird electronic with this album, glåsbird's 'a sonic expedition' draws to its close. it began at the north pole, in the frozen waters of the arctic ocean and it ends at the south pole, on the world's least populated continent; the ice-capped desolate grandeur that is antarctica. it had been suspected that this land existed long before it had been discovered and many had died in their pursuit to find it. some may even have died as a consequence of accidentally discovering it, through detoured voyages striking into glaciers. the music here in antarctica returns to modern classical, as the artist comes full circle. echoes of 2019's debut album set in greenland can be felt in places, as soaring violin and cello collide. however, these 8 tracks gather up the compositional and technical learning throughout the series, as glåsbird looks forward to the challenges of the future. the photography in this album is from oceanographer neha ramsarup, who traveled on the south african polar vessel sa agulhas ii, deploying instruments and collecting seawater samples along the voyage from cape town (south africa) to south african national antarctic expedition (sanae iv). these trips are joined by a range of marine scientists, whose keen interests lie in ocean properties such as sea ice and weather as well as mammals, birds, whales and penguins who call these polar regions home. this special limited edition release is in a run of 100 copies. modeled around the classic gatefold vinyl lp. it includes printed front, rear and inner sleeves and a card sleeve housing a printed vinyl-effect cdr."

""pokémon: blue version was released in north america in 1998. i was 8 years old. in my earliest memories playing it, it’s summer in my grandmother’s basement, i’m under blanket forts, i’m wrapped in my hand-woven purple blanket, and i’m sharing a super size fry with my grandmother (before they got rid of them). i played. i napped. i would wake, and i would play. i would train, i would explore, and i would nap. the music lives in my heart. in pokédreams: blue version, red version, and yellow version, i wanted to recreate those earliest feelings of excitement, of exploration, and of peace. blue was created with more slumbery (and perhaps spooky, more night-time) tones including the lavender, pokémon tower, and jigglypuff tracks. pallet town is by far my favorite song of any in the series and, fittingly, it was the first i ever created. red was created with some intentionally brighter and cheery moods; both cinnabar island as well as evolution, for example, feel like tending to a gently-lit fire at sunset. if blue version is walking through a sleepy, gentle forest, then red version is watching the sun rise from your blanket fort, not quite awake, looking forward to a fresh new day. yellow was created with an intent to explore. in terms of song choice, i prioritized unused tracks found by the fan community through data mining and rom analysis, like the alternate (unused) ending track, field route, and the unused victory theme (titled “勝利 victory!"" on the album). i also included the yellow version tracks - pikachu’s beach and the yellow version title screen theme - which i wasn’t familiar with, since my best friend had this version and i didn’t. this album is fresh to my ears with songs that are less familiar to me, yet they feel exciting and fun - like the beach!"""

d3249,"lost at sea chris shiflett folk, world, & country tri-fold digisleeve notes from the label : punk veteran. rock & roll hall of fame inductee. americana and rock songwriter. modern-day guitar hero. for more than 25 years, chris shiflett has blurred the lines between genre and generation, balancing his full-band projects with a thriving solo career. he turns a new page with lost at sea, a solo record that builds a bridge between nashville — where shiflett has become a frequent visitor, performing on the grand ole opry one minute and collaborating with music city tastemakers like jaren johnston and dave cobb the next — and his native california. caught halfway between the honky-tonk saloon and the punk-rock dive bar, lost at sea is both eclectic and electric, making room for alt-country crunch, guitar-driven grit, and sharp songwriting. tying that mix together is shiflett himself: a musical renaissance man whose influences are every bit as wide-ranging as his resumé. shiflett recorded the majority of lost at sea in nashville, working with producer and collaborator jaren johnston—frontman of the cadillac three, as well as the songwriter behind nearly a dozen number 1 country hits—and a small cast of americana all-stars. among them were fellow guitar slingers worsham, bukovac, and nathan keeterle, all three of whom laced the record with fiery fretwork. he also teamed up with a number of co-writers, partnering with kendell marvel, cody jinks, and others to fill lost at sea with storylines that pack as hefty a punch as the music itself. lost at sea showcases the full range of shiflett's abilities. there are harmonized guitar solos worthy of thin lizzy, amplified country anthems, and roots-rockers steeped in tom petty's influence. the breakneck pace and palm-muted guitars of ""parties"" salute shiflett's early days within the bay area punk scene, while ""damage control"" — with its layers of reverb, pulsing percussion, and echoplex tape delay — flirts with the atmospheric dub music that lee scratch perry introduced. everything is grounded in melody. shiflett nods to his heroes throughout, but he charts his own territory, too, whipping up a diverse sound that's distinctly his own."

d6817,"integrated tech solutions aesop rock hip-hop/rap “integrated tech solutions: building a bridge to a better tomorrow,” announces an ai-sounding voice at the outset of mc and producer ‘s 10th album. over a peppy ’80s infomercial–style backing track, the digital voice sketches out a corporate goal focused on persuading an unsuspecting populace to buy into “a system of lifestyle and industry applications designed to curate a desired multi-experience.” then the voice speeds up so it can babble out a disclaimer that absolves the company of any and all potential liability. against this backdrop of a fictional capitalist monster corporation, aesop rock explores the ways technology—and humankind’s predictable abuse of it—shapes both the world and the individual. “two point five million years ago/ a friend of mine made a tool from a stone and defended his tribe,” raps the mc over the wormy funk of agenda-setting cut “mindful solutionism.” the track, a nod to vintage run-dmc rhyme patterns, goes on to itemize a sarcastic list of developments that sprung from that first invention, including weaponized atom splitting, automated workforces, and chemistry-facilitated genocide. “cameras in your favorite corners, plastic in the wilderness,” continues aesop rock, reaching the crux of the tirade: “we can not be trusted with the stuff that we come up with/ the machinery could eat us—we just really love our buttons.” aesop rock displays a hefty dose of skepticism emanates across the 18-track album, on which the mc’s bars are laid atop a selection of mostly self-produced backdrops that often strike a bluesy note thanks to judicious use of prowling basslines and deliberately downcast guitar. on “pigeonometry,” the mc describes the way leonardo da vinci’s inventions and theories have been twisted and exploited. four songs into the album, graces “living curfew” with a guest verse that casts him as a lonesome observer of eerie times: “i remember when nights was ambulance sirens/ watching ’em put bodies inside ’em/ sometimes somebody outside whylin’ on empty streets dead silent/ half-empty stores, scared to breathe,” raps woods, flashing back to the early days of the pandemic over a backdrop of murmuring blues. as the album nears its conclusion, a more hopeful environmental vision emerges. aesop casts his gaze towards nature as an escape route from the capitalist tech grind on “by the river.” an ode to the nourishing power of bodies of water, aesop sketches a portrait of the hudson, susquehanna, and willamette rivers that’s shot through with childlike wonder. “i wonder what could possibly be lurking on the bottom,” he raps over gently undulating funk. “i look into the water and imagine all the options.” in the end, it’s the ideal of discovery and imagination that becomes the antidote to the relentless march for profit."
d6818,"diagnosis sen morimoto alternative while born in kyoto, japan, and raised in massachusetts, indie-jazz-rap multi-instrumentalist has become synonymous with chicago’s music scene. he’s a co-owner and operator of which is a home for the city’s greatest underground weirdos, and his name is often found in producer or instrument credits for artists on that label and beyond. on his third solo album, morimoto keeps his eyes on what matters artistically and interrogates everything else. “it didn’t used to be content/ it used to be art,” morimoto sighs on “feel change,” before going on to lament how the music industry encourages social climbing and “deconstructing my identity for opportunities on “reality.” his clearest attempt at defining the opposition to these spiritual bummers is in “if the answer isn’t love,” on which he asks a higher power what will remain when the world as we know it has crumbled. “if the answer isn’t love/ then forget that i asked,” is the punchline. the destruction morimoto imagines nods to the literal threat of world disaster, but also to the way disillusionment can ravage your sense of purpose. while previous morimoto albums have been defined by chaotic, rambling maximalism, is far more structured around hooks and grooves, though no less compositionally complex. “if the answer isn’t love” sounds like a motown track with fuzzed-out guitar solos. “bad state” is a psychedelic funk cut, a little reminiscent of toro y moi with its big, bold vocal hooks. it’s a kind of songwriting that’s easy to take at face value, which bolsters morimoto’s words, turning them into transmissions meant to be clearly received. that’s most prominent on the album’s standout, title track “diagnosis.” this is the one song where morimoto really lets himself shine as a rapper, hamming up his voice and showing off with his rhymes. he explores life under capitalism’s boot, the feeling of working all day to afford the comforts you need to keep working, too exhausted to envision an alternative. “capital manipulates the labor/ make a bag, it feels like it’ll save ya/ the money never acts against its nature/ fuck the cops, the banks, the legislature,” is his mic-drop moment at the end of the excellent second verse. often across it feels like morimoto takes on the role of a friend offering gentle but urgent advice. “at some point, you’ll have to start living your life instead of thinking about it,” he sings on “bad state”; “picking at scabs won’t heal them faster/ in fact, you’ll make a scar out of nothing,” on “what you say.” that his tone is encouraging, as opposed to despondent, feels deliberate. morimoto’s diagnosis is that it’s hard to concentrate on great art under a cold and cruel system; love, warmth, and kindness are the antidotes."
d6819,"whiplash asha sheshadri experimental, sound art there’s a concept called —the opposite of déjà vu—that occurs when the familiar is rendered unfamiliar; it’s the feeling when, for instance, a room you know well suddenly seems strange (has that sofa always been that color?), or if you miss a turn on a route you’ve driven a thousand times, or a family member seems, for one moment, like a complete stranger. on debut album , new york-based ambient composer and sound artist asha sheshadri creates pieces that embody this feeling. liner notes state that the tracks were “arranged & recorded… in bedrooms, living rooms, libraries, bars, airplanes, backyards and parks across north america,” but although this might suggest familiarity or even domesticity, the sonic flotsam and jetsam (including white noise, overlapping conversations, rustling, nondescript electronic beeping) is paired with enigmatic spoken word parts, both becoming headier and stranger by their proximity to one another. if you’ve ever been moved by a strange exhibition in an art gallery, but you’re quite not sure why, then this album is for you. listening to we never quite get an answer. sheshadri seems to delight in creating pieces that are somehow just out of reach. is that the sound of a church bell tolling beneath layers of electronic processing on “i know, you’re cold”? what are those chewed-up textures on “stimulus progression” that seem forever crumpling in on themselves? the spoken word samples on “irreplaceable” are cut off by blasts of mechanical whirring before they can get to any real meaning: “my current art practice relies primarily on the plundering and interpretation of th— in order to represent—.” in the liner notes, sheshadri also explains that evokes “a refracted ambivalence towards what was once real, the endless cycle of reckoning with wherever ‘home’ has taken place.” the church bells on “i know you’re cold” were “once real” but are now saturated with a heavy flanging effect and overlaid with the sound of running water, foregrounding a free-flowing narrative. the piano—an instrument often associated with domestic, homey spaces—on “whiplash,” “shipwreck,” “stimulus progression,” and “looting index” is distressed and detuned until it sounds ghostly and fragile. the specificity of the lyrics—“flying over middle america on a plane seat without a retractable tray” on “a holding pattern,” or “the north country fair mall at the particular time of day when it feels like a ghost mall inside and it’s sweltering outside” on album highlight “some places to find quiet and peace”—suggests how transitory the temporary homes of “bedrooms, living rooms, libraries” or plane seats, for all their immediate realness, really are. it’s notable that the vocal samples, sourced from “video work, excerpts from writers…recovered and recycled voice/text memos,” used by sheshadri often seem to be from supporting characters in a story rather than main ones (“supporting characters” is even a song title on ): someone reminds a friend of their personal growth, a woman memorializes her mother, a documentary-style voiceover explains part of a musician’s oeuvre. many are reminiscent of short stories by breece d’j pancake or miranda july, where one vital piece of information seems to hover, specter-like, over the narrative but is never explicitly mentioned. it’s in these spaces between meaning, though, that this strange and lovely album calls home. would you prefer it explained?"
d6820,"access to the lonely rid of me rock , the 2021 debut from philadelphia-based, diy, noisy rock outfit , signaled a fledgling band on the cusp of finding its sound. reverb-drenched and murky, it hurdled from british post-punk melodicism to big grungy licks complete with a poppy sensibility, in large part due to the aching confessionals and face-melting cries let loose by bassist and vocalist itarya rosenberg. while conjured bleary-eyed images of a plastered late-night at some dark and dingy diy basement, rid of me’s sophomore effort, , is huge, even arena-sized. judging from the band’s scorched-earth precision, it’s clear that rosenberg, guitarists mike mcginnis and jon dehart; and drummer mike howard were schooled on a healthy dose of ’90s grunge, post-hardcore, and noise-rock — and rid of me have that combo of rage, noise, and melody down pat. rosenberg’s propulsive bottom end is particularly gnarly; in tandem with howard’s driving, odd time signature-laden pummeling, the rigorous one-two punch hints at the jesus lizard’s beast of a rhythm section. factor in mcginnis and hart’s cutthroat twin guitar salvos, and there’s nary a moment to exhale throughout the album’s eleven meaty tracks. like the smattering of covers sprinkled on their bandcamp page, which include serviceable takes on , , and classics, rid of me don’t shy away from showing off their influences on . “feel me” sounds like an outtake from ; “libertarian noise rock” is two blistering minutes of helmet-like fury; “cut” approaches a sludgy heaviness that hits as hard as the . aside from unleashing catchy ear bleeders with abandon, rid of me are just as adept when turning down the volume and rosenberg is to thank for that. he runs the emotional gamut, screaming his head off on one song (“hell of it”), then achieving a quiet beauty and crushing hearts the next (“the weekend”). personal struggles inform rosenberg’s lyrics and titles like “i’m so lonesome i could die,” “gutted,” and namesake song “rid of me” are manifestations of those internal battles. but even when struggling with demons, there’s a flickering glimmer of hope as fairly bursts with a new lease on life-type energy. that’s reflected in the pulverizing riffage and bottomless hooks the quartet bang out, and with rosenberg’s brutally honest nature exposed, rid of me hit on all cylinders."
d6821,"the comeback kid marnie stern rock about a year after ’s last solo record (2013’s ), the guitar heroine got tapped for a gig no one could have predicted: a high-profile cleanup hitter spot in seth meyers’ house band. in retrospect, her eight-year stint in the 8g band makes perfect sense given the post-hardcore/punk-rock pedigree of her bandmates, which included syd butler and seth jabour ( ); eli janney ( ); and time keeper-turned-actor fred armisen (trenchmouth). but let’s be honest: stern’s dizzying music is in a manic league of its own, so much so that her late night tv licks never quite reflected her range as a restless singer-songwriter and straight-up . enter the long overdue return of the new york native’s first love: leaping into the void like her life depends on it. or at the very least, her existential sense of self and overall happiness—something she appears to directly address on the tightly wound opening track “plain speak.” as stern’s riffs careen across the splashy percussion of arcade fire drummer jeremy gara—a fitting replacement for past foils like zach hill ( ) and kid millions ( )—she repeats a mantra we can all relate to: “i can’t keep on moving backwards.” considering how confident and slick is, the line serves as both a fitting mission statement and palpable modus operandi. at 12 songs and 29 minutes, stern’s fifth album is arguably her most focused, leaving very little room either to breathe or fully absorb the sounds flying by our ears and eyes. that goes for everything from the hypnotic vocal hooks and wildly expressive call-and-response chords of “earth eater” to the prickly, borderline power ballad progressions of “til it’s over.” stern even puts her own personal stamp on with an infectious rendition of the chorus line composition “il girotondo della note” that sounds as if it were beamed from a bouncy castle on mars. which kinda explains the album’s comic book-ish cover; isn’t just a reminder of stern’s roots and the revved-up records she’s yet to write. it’s a feral whirlwind of fearless riffs and ideas that holds absolutely nothing back in its pursuit of personal growth. or as stern says on “nested,” “get out the hero, and get onto the tracks/ don’t let no one tell you different.”"
d6822,"i was too young to hear silence patrick shiroishi experimental los angeles free jazz saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist is an inveterate collaborator. this year alone, he’s already put , with another due . on his latest “solo” work, , shiroishi works in tandem not with another human performer, but with the space offered by monumental architecture. and while musicians have long used the cavernous acoustics of cathedrals and churches to impart a certain grandiosity, here shiroishi performs in a shrine to l.a.’s cult of the personal vehicle: a parking structure. recorded in a single take, the record explores sonic negative space, staking out improvised interactions between silence, performance, and resonance. stepping onto the well-trodden territory of japanese philosophy, shiroishi refers to the concept of 間 (“ma,” or negative space) when discussing the album in the liner notes. on opener “stand still like a hummingbird,” the spaces in between the notes leave room for a thickly reverberant atmosphere which his sparse, staccato saxophone intimations disrupt, the tones settling like dust. other tracks are packed with rapid, virtuosic runs (“i almost said”) or smooth, melodic figures (“if only heaven would give me another ten years”). shiroishi explores how different saxophone timbres (and even crisp glockenspiel in “how will we get back to life again?”) interact with the concrete walls around him, shifting from smooth to strained to whispered tones. the effect is at once minimalist and abstract, requiring an attentive ear to indulge in its capacious sound. this abstract music isn’t being made in a vacuum, however, as “tule lake blues” suggests. taking its name from tule lake—the site of the largest japanese american internment camp during world war ii—the song isn’t the shiroishi’s invoked the history of his ancestors. but in the context of an exploration of space—particularly negative, or so-called “empty” space—the solemn tones of “tule lake blues” not only call to mind the vacated homes of japanese american internees but also the “empty” land onto which they were relocated. no land in america, after all, is truly empty, and tule lake was the largest example of how land dispossessed from indigenous americans was for wartime incarceration. so in the plaintive wails that shiroishi extracts from his sax—at times evoking a violin, at others a piercing shriek—we might hear the politics of space and its emptying; the history of two removals, one predicated on the other."

d6826,"cash corridos 3 cash bently latin despite the fact that the united states’ latino population reaches nearly 64 million, latin music continues to experience a perpetual “moment.” behind this frequently employed phrase—which captures a surge in popularity while subtly implying its transient nature—lies a more significant issue: the mainstream press and the music industry have historically failed to recognize that latino artists have consistently crafted invaluable art. and are presented to non-latino audiences as isolated phenomena, perpetually reselling latin music as a fad, one that demands the listener’s attention only once it becomes ubiquitous. luckily, the millions of latinos living in the united states know better. this art warrants praise and demands acknowledgment for what it is—an intrinsic part of the beautiful, diverse fabric of this country. on , cash bently, an american-born producer with el salvadorian and guatemalan roots, shows that a memorable album doesn’t appear out of thin air. bently started his music career at age seven, touring as part of his family’s cumbia band, and later became part of a new wave of artists and producers on soundcloud, where he immersed himself in a subgenre of trap called pluggnb. combining his upbringing in a primarily latin american community with his experience as a soundcloud rapper, cash bently delivers a modern take on regional mexican music, somewhere between hip-hop, , and . these influences are immediately recognizable in tracks like “platicar” and “enamorado” on “platicar” is a mellow ballad with softly auto-tuned vocals, high-pitched echoes, and racy lyrics that imply an affair with a married woman. boasting traditional horns and string flourishes, “enamorado” brings out a bravado in bently with which he effortlessly serenades an imaginary lover, as if he were an elder crooner. standout “negaron un favor” recounts bently’s experience growing up in the states. its tough lyrics speak about sipping codeine and out-earning his peers, all while trying to carve a name for himself. the horn arrangements, tightly paired with a polished acoustic guitar riff, make for a hard-hitting tune that is part corrido, part outlaw country. songs like “amar otra vez” and “este mundo,” showcase bently’s versatility. understated bedroom pop arrangements marked by subtle electronic textures and warbly synth tones act as a bridge to a mellower section of the album. these tracks dispense with horns and punchy strings in favor of an indie pop approach. on both songs, bently channels feelings of alienation and longing: being at odds with the world, experiencing heartbreak, and yearning for a loved one. and though these themes are present throughout the album, they never become redundant. instead, they work together as one long multifaceted ballad that reflects dual musical lineages. cash bently’s infusion of modern hip-hop with mexican traditional music creates a uniquely american album influenced by the precedents of black and latin innovators—captivating and sonically rich."

d6828,"afternoon x vanishing twin alternative until recently, stood on the shoulders of giants. although their excellent previous albums ( , , and ) are inspired interpretations of lounge music, kosmische, dub, and jazz, they may have too readily provoked comparisons to some usual suspects such as stereolab, esquivel!, sun ra, alain goraguer’s soundtrack for the 1973 film , and so on. but , the trio’s new album, changes that, displaying transformed focus and imagination. the result is fever dream music, bad trip music, defined less by cartoonish apparitions than by existential dread; the overwhelming sense that we’re all just contours on a 2d plane. this is music to soundtrack your thumbs going weird. whereas previous albums were built around a loose scaffolding of swinging drums and bass; analog electronic detailing; and cathy lucas’s impassive vocals, exchanges this for something more unpredictable. vanishing twin’s songwriting now treats everything as malleable. a vocal refrain might be bit-crushed beyond recognition. the grooves are soggier and swampier (reminiscent of pete um and ken nordine’s album), but liable to short out. abstract rumbles and booms punctuate much of the record, evoking the molten quality of the sounds made by italian futurist luigi russolo’s membrane-based noise machines. vanishing twin have also harnessed more fundamental musical building blocks like frequency, structure, and instrument allegiance. “brain weather” seems to tune into three different songs, like an automaton radio. “the down below” (an album highlight) is a cornucopia of strange structural shifts, interesting textural combinations, and addictive chord changes and melodies that drift in and out of the gloom. the purring bass texture in “lotus eater” and robot vocal processing in “marbles” are pitched at frequencies that tickle the inside of your skull. has a wabi-sabi quality; it feels chopped up, crushed, saturated, blown out, and remolded. the weirdness is now foundational. the first line of the first track, “melty”, (sung with exquisite stacked harmonies) seems to herald what is to follow: “all that is solid melts into air.” the strangeness of this album is part of the roots, the atmosphere, the vessel itself. it’s somehow more immediate. it gets in your teeth. vanishing twin have always attempted to conjure a specific sense of place or mood. but up until now, we’ve been there before, and felt it before, the arid surface of a distant planet or a space-age cocktail bar, say, or a sense of cool intrigue or dreamy dissociation. on , though, they have conjured phantasmagorical new spaces. where does “the down below”—with its stop-start structure, washes of sitar, and dust clouds of slack percussion—dwell? what is the emotional tenor of “marbles”, and those claustrophobically airless beats, chewed-up loops, slightly detuned guitar, and disembodied voices? is the sound of a band now freed to stand alone in an uncanny valley of their own making."
d6829,"errors capra where the combination of metal and punk once stood out as novel, the two subcultures have been bedfellows for so long at this point that the now holds true. bands who tread the heavily populated middle ground with one foot in each lane must do everything in their power to avoid sounding rote, derivative, and featureless. so it says a lot that the lafayette, louisiana quartet capra somehow manages to make its signature punk-metal hybrid land with a spark of freshness. much like capra’s 2020 debut , the band’s sophomore effort recaptures the initial thrill of melding these genres as if it still represented a bold step that required nerve to pull off. indeed, capra possesses a rare ability to induce a sense of careening toward the edge. on paper, of course, the recipe seems simple: marry the precision of metal with the anarchic energy of punk and switch gears enough to keep things interesting. indirectly, however, capra proves just how elusive that recipe actually is. fans of this brand of heavy music, for example, have heard countless iterations of the brawny hardcore riff that introduces “tied up.” but, even before the song reaches the 40-second mark, the band executes three dynamic shifts with unparalleled agility. none of the riffs, tempos or beats from “tied up,” in fact, would stand out all that much by themselves. and yet, for all the times we’ve heard these same stock ingredients, we haven’t heard them quite like . guitarist tyler harper and drummer jeremy randazzo, who founded the band together in 2016, have a knack for playing as if their lives depended on their ability to convey enthusiasm to the audience. so much music of this ilk settles into a numbing static after several songs in a row, but harper, randazzo, and new bassist trevor alleman appear to be incapable of letting their energy falter. meanwhile, vocalist crow lotus almost singlehandedly breathes new life into an enraged-screamer paradigm that sorely needed it. “it can’t be normal to feel this way,” she sings in the first verse of leadoff track “chsf.” she continues: “i feel so empty, please god / why can’t i connect to anyone or anything at all?” . throughout the album, a sense of hollowness pervades, as lotus tackles crippling depression (“chsf,” “obligatory existence”), toxic shame (“transplant”), hopelessness (“d’arc”) and a host of other post-traumatic sensations. lotus made a conscious decision to explore mental health issues from a more personal perspective this time. she interprets the title “errors” as a reference to people who feel so broken inside that they see their very existence as a kind of mistake. harper, on the other hand, views the title more from the standpoint that our mistakes provide fodder for growth. the contrast between those viewpoints propels the music on , which thoroughly invigorates, even as it leaves haunting images in its wake."
d6830,"the father of libyan reggae ibrahim hesnawi reggae it wasn’t too long after he heard jamaican legend bob marley for the first time that ibrahim hesnawi embarked on a decades-long music career of his own, pioneering reggae in libya and the arab world. through the 1980s and into the 2000s, he amassed a sprawling catalog of more than 15 albums, highlights from which have now been compiled by berlin-based label across nine tracks—many of them unheard outside north africa until now— offers a compact showcase of the reggae pioneer. singing mostly in libyan arabic and focusing on a message of humanism and peace, hesnawi’s goal was to bring reggae to the youth of libya. “[reggae lyrics] led me to create several political songs about struggles and striving for freedom myself,” hesnawi explains in the compilation’s liner notes. “i wanted to speak about these things in my music, and i believe that’s what i was good at, and also what i became successful for.” that mission is reflected in tracks like “al hob wal salam” and “only world,” which combine existential musings in arabic and english with electric guitar, vibraslap, and spaced-out keyboards. hesnawi’s vocal approach—straightforward and heartfelt—conveys his message of love and unity with ease. tracks like “tendme” and “kesati” highlight hesnawi’s ability to build upward from a reggae foundation, adding touches of funk, , and libyan pop. habibi funk’s masterful co-curation work with hesnawi is particularly evident on the compilation’s last two tracks, “enti” and “watany al kabir.” it took the label years to hunt down renditions of these songs, and their brisk, bouncy melodies, keyboard stabs, and backing vocals further represent hesnawi’s skilled pairing of kingston reggae with modern arabic music, and how his mission remained intact across decades of economic and political upheaval."

d6832,"i killed your dog l’rain experimental in a with , taja cheek, the mastermind behind , called attention to the advantages of making uncategorizable music: “if someone can’t pin down what you are, then you can be whatever you want to be,” she said of her penchant for reinvention. on her latest album, that permission for infinite interpretability extends from artist to listener. the album is so rich with playful experimentation that it can be enjoyed as an experimental pop-soul album, a campy indie rock opera, or some other thing that only becomes clear with further listens. all of it is in service of exploring the thrills of daring to know, love, and hurt another person. take the provocative title track on which cheek confesses, “i killed your dog/ it made me happy,” over creeping keys and bass that—after a cue of haunting, modulated laughter—morphs into a florid swirl of horns and whooshing synths. the track pulls on a thread introduced on “kill self” from 2021’s , which opens with the line, “reverse evolve/ kissing my dogs/ killing myself.” “i killed your dog” takes the destruction a step further, turning a confession of murder into a kind of hymn. on her previous albums, cheek and an evolving crew of collaborators—including l’rain mainstays andrew lappin and ben chapoteau-katz—explored the ins and outs of grief and resilience via unconventional compositions consisting of atmospheric instrumentation and found sounds. while those albums established l’rain as an icon of experimental music, —which cheek has described as her “basic bitch” album—takes a page from poppier genres without sacrificing that innovative edge. l’rain’s characteristically quirky interludes remain—like the patchwork of zooms and bloops on “all the days you remember,” or the intro of “what’s that song?” during which someone verbally describes the instrumentation that follows. but songs like “new year’s unresolution” step into more conventional pop music structures, using ethereal indie rock to probe the uncertainty of a new breakup and following a verse-chorus-verse path before spinning into a winding outro. cheek’s approach to composition is often compared to sound collage, but the dynamism of the soundscapes on casts l’rain as a project capable of instilling its various musical elements with both artful tension and graceful slack to create rich tapestries of sound. one of those elements is the human voice—both cheek’s and others—which rises and falls in space and tone to hold the disparate instrumental elements together. another is guitar, which cheek threads throughout the album letting it flourish at the forefront of tracks like “5 to 8 hours a day (wwwag),” a spacey folk song about humans’ hidden capacity for surprising actions. even on this “basic bitch”—i.e. more “approachable”—album l’rain’s compositions and subjects challenge listeners to reconsider what they expect from popular and experimental music alike."
d6833,"water made us jamila woods r&b/soul on , the latest album from chicago-born singer, songwriter, and poet, dissects, celebrates, and vents about the thrilling highs and gut-wrenching lows of romantic love. the album’s title comes from the raw, resolute “good news,” in which woods finds a faint kernel of hope by taking a bird’s eye view of a strained relationship and realizing that if she and her partner found happiness once, they might be able to find it again. she compares love to water—a fluid, generative substance which, by its very nature, can move, change, and eventually return back to its source: “the good news is we were happy once/ the good news is water always runs back where it came from/ the good news is water made us.” but before we get to love’s return, woods takes us back to the time before the relationship reached its breaking point with album opener “bugs.” backed by lush bass, strings, harp, and keyboard, woods playfully details her partner’s tics and minor annoyances. recognizing that she ain’t perfect herself, she asks her partner to “please be patient with me.” the song is an almost too-accurate depiction of the kind of lived-in intimacy that has the power to either forge lifelong bonds or cause a long-term relationship to sink under the weight of resentment. from here, woods walks us through the many cycles and particularities of love. “tiny garden,” featuring , is a groovy, mid-tempo bop that posits love as an ongoing process of care, support, and enrichment. before the vocal harmonies swoop in for the song’s lovely chorus, woods assures her partner that while her love may not be dramatic and overly demonstrative, it will be nourishing and consistent. “it’s not gonna be a big production,” she sings, “it’s not butterflies or fireworks/ said it’s gonna be a tiny garden, but i feed it every day.” all the joy, warmth, hurt, and even the mundanity that comes with love and connection turn up in songs like “wolfsheep,” “boomerang,” and “headfirst.” by the time we get “wreckage room,” things have gone off the rails, and woods employs the song’s spare, lonesome sound to mourn a love that couldn’t be rescued. is an emotionally harrowing journey, a reminder that love requires openness and surrender. sometimes, love can feel like riding raging waters; other times, it’s like being swept out into the warmth of the ocean. most times, it’s both at once."

d6835,"death is home aïsha devi electronic the elements are familiar: piercing riffs from classic trance; kickdrums from hardcore rave; the gothic tonalities of ‘80s industrial, ebm, and coldwave; the slamming rhythmic disjunctions of grime; the circling 808s of trap; androgynous, bordering-on-alien ultra-processed vocals. this particular blend of sounds has been integral to tibetan-nepalese-swiss creator s style since her first ep in 2013. and given that it no longer sounds radically new, you might think that it’s in danger of losing its edge—but that would be missing the point. first, there are sonic absolutes in play here: the use of high frequencies and the jagged leaps from silence to slamming industrial drums means the music will always have an adrenalized unease to it. second, and even more important, this music was never about its novelty, but the fact that it provided a language for exploratory musicians like devi to operate outside of the norms of the club and experimental electronica establishments. to put it mildly, there remains a vast amount still to be said in that language. and aïsha devi has always had a lot to say. anyone who has ever witnessed her live shows will know that she is a born performer and consummate musician, and on her third album—and first in five years—that fact is clearer than ever. from the outset, it’s clear that she’s upped her production game, a fact that’s clinched by the way the piercing high-pitched synth in opener “not defined by the visible” swerves and glides into complex, even joyous melodies. throughout the album, the tension between that cold, gothic, industrial edge and pure pleasure is examined and played with. the bodily groove of trap beats and the use of pop melody on tracks like the centerpiece “unborn yet alive” aren’t just affectation, they’re integral to what this record . it’s an intense experience. devi has talked a lot about self-realization through her art, and it’s easy to feel the sheer force of will creating something through the ritualistic processes here—the pounding second half of the album’s eight-minute closer is not for the faint of heart, but its payoff is majestic. but perhaps the album’s emblematic track is “dimensional spleen,” a collaboration with kenyan producer . the simultaneous silliness and disquieting nature of the title sets the tone for a tune that simultaneously feels like a sci-fi war machine, a rewiring of your synapses, and a whimsical pop song—albeit one sung by interdimensional sprites. there’s a lot to it, and a lot to this album in general: proof positive that this neo-gothic sound palette is maturing into something durable and deep-seated."

(the songs even share the terse, punchy wording of pulp fiction titles—“ending of the stream,” “suspension bridge collapse,” “beat me down.”) the meaning might not always be apparent, but the feeling always is. although is the serfs’ third album, you would be forgiven for thinking it is their first. it has the ferocious, listen-to-this-immediately quality of the best debuts. there are slower moments, granted—“spectral analysis” is one highlight, a kind of sewage runoff from exotica music and george michael—but this expedient style stretches across the record, with simple drum machine patterns repeating until they short out, flurries of garbled lyrics, and a barrage of electronic flotsam and jetsam like gnarled keyboard sounds and static-y textures. despite the frenzy of this wonky success, though, there’s still the underlying sense that everything on this record has been placed precisely where it needs to be."

d6858,"techxodus speaker music electronic in black music, technology has never been solely a means to an end. the tools we employ to make and manipulate sound have always come with higher stakes. by nature of the sociopolitical context in which black music exists, the music that we make requires a liberatory imperative. the work of musician/theorist deforrest brown jr. (aka ) is grounded in black liberation praxis while questioning what liberation looks like and how music serves that aim. on his previous album, 2020’s , brown used his dynamic detroit techno and ambient-influenced compositions to posit black music itself as a liberation technology. brown builds on that premise with his latest album, . opens with “d.t.a.w.o. (deprogramming the atonist world order).” amidst a dreamy, looping synth, brown appears to state a direct but novel mission statement: “black music that sounds technological rather than music made with technology.” by focusing on the technological character of black music, brown aligns himself with a long continuum of black artists and thinkers like octavia butler, sun ra, and more who channel speculative art into a revolutionary creative practice. as the track’s intensity builds, pillowy kick drums echo through the soundscape creating a faint cardiovascular-like rhythm. “techno-vernacular phreak” comes next with syncopated kicks, snares, and toms that call to mind the complex drumming language of jazz. “holosonic rebellion” opens with skittering hi-hats supporting a drifting ambient soundscape. the music here builds patiently as sounds are allowed to enter and recede without hurry. a handful of samples point to the thematic content of “holosonic rebellion” as screams, crashes, and conflict help narrate the sound of a violent uprising. as part of the cultural lifeblood of black people, black music has always been a key tool in our collective fight on multiple fronts. myth, spirit, politics, culture, aesthetics and beyond, the black experience worldwide is characterized by an ongoing fight for survival, dignity, and freedom. presents us with a soundtrack for this struggle as well as an intellectual framework which we can use to contemplate our relationship to technology and the future."

(frontman austin haines, no slouch himself, sounds absolutely fucking , in the best way possible.) but it’s the fluidity of the band’s arrangements, and the ease with which they glide between tempos and textures, that makes a true standout. in a modern death metal scene rife with bands who are slavishly devoted to one specific element of the genre— ’s swedeath buzzsaw, ’s punkish lurch, ’s brutal stomp—it’s refreshing to hear outer heaven refrain from outright hero worship. (guest appearances from members of , , , and hint at the breadth of the band’s metal collections.) works as a no-bullshit, fist-in-the-face death metal record, but it also frequently zigs when you think it’s going to zag. in death metal english parlance, you might say outer heaven’s wretched utterings of insalubrious blasphemies traverse multitudinous landscapes without the strain of toil. you can also just say that they rip."
d6864,"circus underwater circus underwater electronic it’s a testament to circus underwater’s foresighted music that if their self-titled debut album were released today, it might sound a little old hat—the response might even be something along the lines of “so what?” as it stands, these thirteen tracks are a rosetta stone for ambient music, dub techno, electronica and beyond. in , you might hear traces of four tet’s crisp folktronica, craven faults’ widescreen atmospherics, or even drexciya’s pulsing, aquatic-themed electro. in , you can just about sense in embryo new forms of switched-on music yet to come, clamoring to be heard. circus underwater were a maryland duo made up of richard sales and jay yarnall. initially dead heads and hippies, in the early 1980s they applied the sonic boundary-pushing attitude of the 1960s to the new possibilities offered by the developments in electronic synthesis. (this is a leap that many in the 1960s failed to make). the result was a collection of pieces that meld futuristic drum machines, synthesizers, and electronic textures with the heady pulse of prog and the organic rattle and roll of american primitive guitar. imagine bobby frank brown being produced by tangerine dream, and you’re halfway there. the through line between this confluence of sounds is a sense of the hypnotic. whether it’s the droning synths on “entrance of the deacon”, or the spiraling guitars on “thunder daughters underwater”, or even the depths of reverb on “weeping of electric sheep”, circus underwater create immersive worlds that slowly pull you under—after all, things only swim into view when you submerge yourself completely. the most tantalizing track here is “the surface of the water”. a dub odyssey with cascading, beach boys-esque harmonies, fathoms-deep bass, and a gentle, almost aching wistfulness, it’s probably the best thing on here, and offers a tantalizing glimpse of what a vocal-led album might sound like. sadly, we’ll never know. circus underwater ceased to be after the release of their debut. although this music might, to us in 2023, seem chunky and old and lovely, like a boxy television that needs a minute to warm up, with exposed diodes and resistors and a big, saturated, technicolor screen, for those select few who were listening in 1984, might just have sounded like the future."

(sharif is a cinephile in general; to read any interview is to end up adding five or ten titles to your letterboxed watchlist.) on that release, noface’s production sounded like it was perennially creeping up behind sharif, ghostly and chilling; the rapper’s bars, clipped and list-like, functioned less as rhymes than as demonic incantations (“past dreams where i’m last seen/ held vaccine/ cronenberg’s last scene/ war world got y award.”) sharif’s plunge into darkness continues on , his latest—and arguably strongest—record, and his first for billy woods’s . this time with manning the boards, sharif conjures nightmare after nightmare, all of them delivered one quick glimpse at a time—like you’re catching sight of terrifying figures from the window of a speeding train at night. sharif has always had chemistry with his producers, but the symbiosis between him and dove has brought out the best in both of them. on “east hollywood,” dove’s production is all dripping pipes, creaking floorboards, and grim piano, and sharif matches the mood from the jump: “cloned reptilians murder at 1600/ …sunrise thesis/ the apartheid seamstress/ hawkeye, float over sky, fungi fetus.” throughout, sharif uses his voice as another instrument in the canvas, plunging it down to the deepest reaches of his register, or doubling and tripling it so there’s one sharif delivering the lines in rumbling low tones while others wail out the same words in a panicked tone above. this produces a deeply disconcerting effect on “dimethyltryptamine.” dove’s production is barely there at all, just a sluggish beat and some groaning industrial tones as the two sharifs—one composed and determined, the other utterly freaked out—glide hauntingly through the empty air. to try to make literal sense of is to miss the point. sharif is trying to give you the of something, not spell everything out in plain english. this approach is crucial: to quote bob dylan, you know something’s happening, but you don’t know what it is—and that nonspecific dread compounds exponentially as the record progresses. is a horror film where the monster is forever waiting right around the next corner. you don’t know what it looks like, but you know it will be the most terrifying thing you’ve ever seen."

d6871,"vol. ii silicone prairie punk, post-punk “have you ever seen or heard of cows/ leaping and jumping and running as fast as they can?” this lyric, from “cows,” a lead single on ’s sophomore record, works as a sort of arcane thesis statement; the album is an irreverent, emphatic ode to joie de vivre. the music is generally high energy, packed with multilayered instrumentation and vocal tracks. it sounds like silicone prairie sole proprietor ian teeple (you may know him from or ), accompanied by friends from the kansas city, missouri punk/indie rock scene, is having a ton of fun playing these tunes. they’re less zany punk than on previous efforts and more expansive, with a wide-ranging experimental palette calling to mind free jazz-leaning , the garage-prog-pop of , and fellow midwesterners . opener “serpent in the grass” makes good use of the band’s standard lo-fi production style, toggling between psychedelic glam and boisterous proto-punk. noodly guitars and squiggly synths conjure visions of antics. teeple’s vocals at times resemble ’s mark e. smith, at times dead kennedys’s . but the band’s main point of reference seems to be swirling ’70s folk, from the hazy “victorian flame” to the guitar-forward “painting trains.” tucked inside are vignettes that feel almost out of place, or engineered to interrupt the flow. there’s “willkommen,” an ambient interlude with ai-like german spoken word—that voice circles back to end the album as well. there’s 20 seconds of dissonant warbling at the end of “cows.” there’s the wavy synth of “freed’s wet tape.” or perhaps those juxtapositions of sound instead help establish the heterogeneity of the record—one where flute solos coexist with skronky kazoo sounds and lyrics about hating the u.s. (the smooth “neon moon” sounds like singing a bizarro version of theme song.) while this record fits well into the roster, it wouldn’t be out of place among the dreamy twee acts on or the broadly experimental diy artists on . which brings us back to “cows,” a folky song packed with a string of references to ranch life and existentialism. life may be marching ever-forward, bringing us, as the song says, “closer to death,” but there you are, “lucky, wild, and free, dancing in the moonlight.” even facing everyday struggles, silicone prairie suggests, there are moments primed for bliss."

d6889,"synthesized sudan: astro​-​nubian electronic jaglara dance sounds from the fashaga underground jantra electronic, dance since the 1970s, various corners of africa have proven to be fertile fields for some truly pioneering electronic sounds—starting with the futuristic folk of cameroonian modernist , the cosmic synths of nigerien , and the groundbreaking soundtracks of algerian today, the continent is home to countless home-grown electronic scenes, its sheer size and (in some cases) lack of infrastructure giving rise to idiosyncratic local styles rooted as much in traditional sounds as they are in the desire to experiment with whatever musical equipment and technology is at hand. isolation and limited infrastructure might go some way in explaining why someone making music as mind-blowing as jantra has toiled in relative obscurity until now. he’s hailed as a hero within his own community but unknown even in broader sudan. in his hometown of gedarif, jantra is known as the man behind the raucous “jaglara” music, translated as “craziness,” the local sound which animates celebrations and gatherings for hours on end. all jantra needs to whip up listeners into a frenzy is his trusty yamaha keyboard, which has been modified by the “keyboard mechanics” of khartoum market to reflect the tone of sudanese music. rather than playing concerts in a traditional sense he freestyles his melodies, live-producing his music based on his audience’s reaction. his approach is raw and minimal, but with only a handful of elements he is able to weave bombastic and endlessly transportive tunes that swirl around and around in a feat of true audio hypnotism. but when the team behind —who have a track record of uncovering obscure sounds from the horn of africa, and most recently released the incredible by noori & his dorpa band from the port of sudan—started working on a record of jantra’s music, his improvisational flair presented a dilemma. how would they distill that spontaneous and unstructured intensity to make an album? the team followed him to his underground parties and ostinato producer janto koité then combined excerpts from those sessions with his few old existing recordings. captures the loose, live feel of jantra’s performances, as each track locks into a solid groove and rides it to trance-inducing heights. album opener “dargoog” feels like a stolen snippet, a little preview of the force that’s about to be unleashed. the recording bleeds neatly into “gedima,” which builds on a trippy web of whirring electronics and repetitive percussive riffs to create a lush, blissed-out tune. the serene joyful atmosphere carries through on “makhafi,” a slow burner where celestial pads quickly give way to synths that snake their around a robust, looping traditional rhythm. jantra’s music feels ecstatic and transcendental, and the reworked tracks fully convey the cathartic power of music and dance as a collective ritual."
d6890,"rbgxdd abderraouf b grissa & dan drohan jazz the art of sampling has altered the way that we make music in incalculable ways. not only has sampling revived interest in old records, but it has also inspired contemporary musicians and listeners to carefully study how those records were made. the conceptual and technical leap required to snatch bits of recorded audio and use them as building blocks for new compositions has opened a pandora’s box of sorts. today, instrumentalists play with a samplist’s ear to connect the past with the present. the latest from producer abderraouf b grissa and producer/drummer embodies the shift that sampling has ushered into modern music. throughout the duo’s groovy, texturally rich instrumentals combine jazz, hip-hop, dub, and experimental electronics in a way that could only happen in a post-sampling world. throughout each of the album’s tracks, genre is traversed liberally and influences—both contemporary and historical—are twisted into something new and strange. the album’s opener, “any time, man,” is a bass-heavy tune with thick drums and an odd vocal sample of a man promising to provide us with “the basics” needed for survival. jarret gilgore’s bright alto saxophone licks recede into the background almost as suddenly as they appear, and the tune’s dark, heady vibe would fit in perfectly next to the work of ‘90s beat experimentalist spectre and his wordsound label. “theme” is a slick, head-nodding, jazz-funk tune with some lovely sax and electric piano. a series of ghostly vocal samples and a whistled melody act as a hook; drohan’s drumming is tight and propulsive. “lake poe” is a dreamy tune where sax and acoustic guitar are processed through a delay effect to produce an oceanic wave of sound. drohan’s drumming is jagged and irregular, in counterpoint to the looping, hypnotic groove created by the melodic instruments. with tracks like the booming hip-hop track “paris 1958” and the blissful nine-minute epic “kalimbient,” is as adventurous as it is tasteful. these sounds reflect a fresh and cutting-edge approach to genre and composition that has been deeply informed by the past."

(1977) ups the unrelenting energy of eastman’s own recording from the compilation, combining stabs of brass with piercing shrieks and extended vocal techniques not present in the original score. even more impressive is a stunning new rendition of (1979), led by devonté hynes (aka ) and adam tendler on dueling pianos. is percussive and propulsive, demanding high physical stamina to play for a full 20 minutes. here, the stress is doubled as the usual four lead instruments are cut down to two. however, the biggest curveball is the addition of a full chamber orchestra, instructed to improvise in response to the pianists. the normally rote, hypnotic piece is transformed into an evolving organism. eastman’s sudden departure left us with a scattered body of work, few recordings, and no directives for what to do with it all. as historians, musicians, and listeners alike pick through what’s left, it’s up to each individual to take a principled stance on what his legacy means. on , wild up chose to fill those gaps in the record with their own joyful noise."
d6892,"michael killer mike hip-hop/rap killer mike’s trajectory feels like the mythical american bootstraps story. he was born to a teen mom in the west atlanta neighborhood of adamsville, attended frederick douglass high school and morehouse college, but eventually dropped out to become a drug dealer. he’d work on music on the side, using dope money to pay for recording equipment. eventually, big boi of outkast gave him a shot, inviting him to appear on their late career single, “the whole world.” that song would go on to win a grammy. mike then partnered with t.i., releasing a string of well-received mixtapes with grand hustle, though none quite broke through to the mainstream. a friend at adult swim paired mike with def jux rapper and producer el-p for what was supposed to be a couple of songs, but they got on so well the sessions turned into a full album, 2012’s . that partnership became run the jewels, an indomitable, festival-headlining, arena-packing project that’s taken el-p and mike to new heights of critical success and fame. along the way, the 48-year-old rapper has become something of a polarizing figure. he’s never been shy about his politics, which don’t fit neatly into a particular category. mike campaigned for bernie sanders in 2016 but has taken meetings with and spoken warmly of georgia’s deeply conservative governor, brian kemp. his activism feels particularly focused on capitalism as a path to freedom, confusing some supporters who otherwise identify with his message of liberation. it’s a bit messy. , killer mike’s first solo album in over a decade, embraces and investigates that messiness. it’s a highly personal record; part origin story, part therapy session, and part love letter to his hometown. across ’s 54 intense minutes, mike presents a complex portrait of himself, not shying away from anger, but trying to temper it with the wisdom that comes from living nearly half a century. he expresses conflicted feelings about abortion on “slummer,” but recognizes that it was the best decision for him and his high-school girlfriend. the song is both warm and wistful but doesn’t display acrimony to anyone involved. though he titles a song about the wreckage of addiction the somewhat insensitive “something for junkies,” he casts an empathetic eye on those who deal with the disease. mike’s honesty is brutal, but it’s very human. the album isn’t all raw emotion, though. there are plenty of celebratory moments, like the dungeon family reunion of “scientists & engineers,” which features incredible performances from andre 3000 and future. curren$y and 2 chainz show up to flex on “spaceship views,” and the playful “don’t let the devil” serves as a reminder of the chemistry that makes run the jewels so magnetic. also amazing; mike reportedly spent nearly $500,000 on the album, and the pristine mixing and lush instrumentation are a joy to get lost in. mike’s no stranger to making enormous music, but executive producer no id helps guide it towards billowing southern gospel rather than rtj’s confrontational bombast. mike describes the album as a “testimonial in church,” an acknowledgment that pain and struggle can lead us to ugly places. but more than anything, is an acceptance of being a perpetual work in progress. the longer you live, the more you understand that your foibles are part of your character. you can grow, change, and reflect, but hopefully, you can get to a place where you feel you’re enough."

d6894,"death’s toll deathcollector metal old-school death metal had a huge moment at the end of the 2010s. records that paid homage to early ’90s greats were in abundance, which fit the zeitgeist: culture-war battles that had cooled raged once more; grunge-inspired fashions returned; blast beats, growls, and grimy guitars were , baby. that initial boom spawned a broader revisiting of classic styles of extreme music. but even as the osdm craze gives way to more subtlety and depth, some sounds remain evergreen. “bolt thrower” continues to trend on twitter every so often, as old heads rediscover the classics and new fans spin records like for the first time. the uk’s , anchored by alumnus andrew whale on drums, marries these old-school sensibilities with contemporary pugilism, and their inaugural full-length, , contains the best of both worlds. production plays a major role here. while today’s death metal tends to lean toward either self-conscious retro scuzz or an ultra-refined sheen, opts for a “raw and unbridled” style without feeling like a self-conscious tribute to times gone by. recorded in multiple countries, still feels alive and immediate. it’s of a piece with the accidentally-on-purpose balanced production of many early death metal milestones. the songwriting also walks the line between familiar and fresh, aided by shapeshifting riffs from mick carey (also of ireland’s ). “coarse visions,” one of the album’s highlights, fades in with springy bass and thundering drums before carey’s guitar boils over. “a taste of ichor” is another meaty helping of riffs that features some midtempo doom sections. both clock in at around four minutes—not too short; not too long. these newer tracks build on what the band explored on their inaugural three-track ep, . all three of those songs appear on ; however, the restraint of gord olson’s production on the latter makes what had already been structurally sound compositions sound like classics by comparison. these digital recordings sound warmer, and put the churning guitar, kieran scott of ‘s forceful vocals, and of course, the massive rhythm section, on an equal footing. the result is 38 minutes of timeless death metal."

d6900,"drum money ekiti sound electronic we are lucky enough to be living in a time when musicians from across the globe are increasingly able to define their own terms of engagement. thanks to the internet, artists can compete in the global sonic marketplace without the kind of patronage or “discovery” by european and north american musicians that characterized of the ‘80s. in the case of south african amapiano, some of the earliest adopters were afrobeats djs in nigeria and ghana, who helped it gain a global foothold. as a result, more and more artists are forging their own sounds from a mixture of local and international vernacular. leke awoyinka aka is the perfect example: raised between lagos and london, his songs combine influences from both nigeria and the uk british not because of some premeditated “musical fusion,” but simply because it reflects his own life. on his second album, , awoyinka raps, chants, and sings in london slang and yoruba, as his music touches on british jungle and broken beat; hip-hop, both classic and modern; classic ; and more. but he’s not fusing these elements—he’s finding common ground and points of connection between them, mapping out a cultural space in which to act out his dramas. sonically he’s a million miles away, but it’s philosophically similar to the way david bowie pulled together his equal love of rock, soul, music hall, chanson, and vegas schmaltz. another crucial element is awoyinka’s extraordinary production. part of the way he’s able to make the myriad elements flow together is because of his love for a wide array of sounds—whether it’s a horn section, an ‘80s funk synth stab, a raw bleep, a cut-up breakbeat, or hefty hand percussion. the drums in particular sound absolutely stellar here—something that’s clearly on his mind given not just the album’s title, but also its lyrics: “i got drum money,” “i have a tom-tom heartbeat.” the songs go from total celebration to wry mischief to politicized anger and back, and from straight-up dancefloor anthems to deep, trip-hop–like poetic musings. the latter features prominently on the final stretch of the album; the contemplative atmosphere draws you deeper into awoyinka’s world, making you wonder about the roller-coaster that’s led to this point, and making you want to play it all over again."

d6906,"karma 業 p.h.0 electronic in ken liu’s series, the chinese american science fiction author expands on his vision of “silkpunk”: not “asian-flavored steampunk” nor “asian-influenced fantasy,” but a particular aesthetic which constitutes a “re-appropriation and rejuvenation of tradition” as a type of alternative worldbuilding from the pacific. the latest album from a group of new york city-based artists making “east asian cyber-metal” [sic] strives in a similar direction, mixing traditional-sounding pentatonic melodies with a potpourri of genres both brutal and futuristic, from industrial ebm to retrofuturistic synthwave. though it stumbles at moments, reimagines what asian music might sound like. a distant suona heralds the beginning of “vanity 虛妄.” after the short introduction, gravelly guitars and syncopated toms take things in a more conventionally metal direction, albeit with a synthesized twist. then—two minutes in, the intensity dissolves, giving way to a post-rock interlude that features an solo supported by a wistful guitar line. a minute later, and there’s a synthwave drop, heavily compressed and undulating with each kick, after which they conclude the track with a heavy breakdown. packing a ranging mix of sounds into just under five minutes, the track is a glorious mess that encapsulates the band’s willingness to take risks. some of these choices pay off, while others don’t land quite as well. “yè 業” starts off strong, with a pentatonic riff over a measured blitz of guitar and electronics, but their first lyrics break any spell the introduction might have cast with a bit of weezer-esque cheese: “a japanese cpu dreams of electric sheep while the system sleeps.” “wu wuo 無我” exhibits a similar tension between their progressive sound and sometimes weary subject matter. beginning with a minimalistic 4×4 beat—we’re deep in techno territory now—they slowly introduce droning and distorted bass. then comes george orwell, with lines from 1984 narrated by a vaguely british voice: “we will abolish the orgasm. there will be no loyalty except loyalty to the party.” the title of the track translates to “anatta,” the buddhist concept of non-self; it sounds like a bit of an on-the-nose critique of communism in the pacific. it’s in these moments when the band dips a little too far into “asian-influenced fantasy,” the typical sonic signifiers of east asia used as window dressing for well-worn themes of asian authoritarianism—yet p.h.0 nevertheless explore musical combinations with a full-throated earnestness that bears fruit in bursts of creativity."

d6909,"silver haze sqürl experimental was born to score the surreal. the duo, composed of filmmaker and icon of the new york underground jim jarmusch and film producer and musician carter logan, formed to provide the score for jarmusch’s opaque spy thriller (2009). glacially paced, elliptically structured, and full of mysterious, tight-lipped characters, the film is uniquely enigmatic. fittingly, it also marked the debut recordings of sqürl (then known as bad rabbit), who lend gnarled guitar drones, otherworldly kosmische, and hazy screwed-up feedback to a soundtrack that also includes fellow travelers through rock music’s outer limits like , , and . across a handful of as well as scores for other jarmusch films—including the skeletal, unsettling drones in 2013’s and the hauntological synth music for —sqürl have since established themselves as masters of unsettled moods, bringing dreary depth and thorny texture to whatever sounds they explore on a given project. their debut album, , feels like a culmination of the meditative, monolithic music they’ve recorded to date. swirling together frigid memories of no wave, heavy-lidded desert rock, and grayscale ambiance, the record feels crushingly heavy but deceptively elusive; a feedback-laden dream of a dying world. there’s a creeping sense of encroaching apocalypse that’s present from the very start of the record. lead single “berlin ‘87,” though explicitly inspired by jarmusch’s memories of living in the german cultural hub, is a bleak tangle of foreboding guitar lines—paced so that each sludgy melody arrives a little slower than you might expect. it feels damp and mud-streaked, the sort of grim instrumental that’s built to suck you into its gloom. on “the end of the world,” jarmusch makes the project’s ominousness explicit, gravely intoning a story about teenagers tearing through the end times as more distorted drones waver and roil like the last wisps of smoke rising from a stomped-out fire. whether his spoken-word explorations are oracular sermonizing or merely speculative fiction, it’s a compelling way to set the tone for the rest of the record that unfolds, an omen of impending doom. collaboration has always been at the core of sqürl, both in the alchemistic interplay of logan and jarmusch’s experiments, as well as with outside players including lutist jozef van wissem (who contributed heavily to the score) as well as occasional guest vocalists like cults’s madeline follin. it’s always seemed to lend their downcast, slow-moving music a sense of direction and purpose—a somewhat hopeful idea that if they’re going to trod through these desolate expanses, they will do so with company and camaraderie. doubles down on this side of their work, welcoming guests on half of its tracks, including appearances from the british singer-songwriter anika, experimental guitarist marc ribot, and french pop mutator and actress charlotte gainsbourg. at their best, these tracks offer moments of light and peace amid the somber proceedings. gainsbourg’s contribution especially—to the overcast “john ashbery takes a walk”—feel piercing and powerful, the sort of performance that overtakes the atmosphere and transforms it into something new. there’s heaviness still, for sure, but her whispered, abstract poetry lends their sound new depth, turning the uneasy instrumental into something more complicated, more beautiful. moments like these showcase the strange power of sqürl. exploratory and never didactic, they follow all of their boldest impulses. and while they seem most comfortable in the darkness, they don’t restrain themselves to one style or sound. as a result, is a labyrinthine but rewarding record that reveals more detail and complexity the more you’re willing to submit to its strange rhythms."
d6910,"turbulence and pulse asher gamedze jazz in the opening scene of director dylan valley’s 17-minute documentary (2023), cape town-based jazz drummer is shown driving on a coastal highway talking about time and history. gamedze explains his view of history in dynamic terms: “not being unfinished,” “unfolding,” and “something that people can actually create.” the idea that history is not the result of a metaphysical predetermining force centers humanity, proposing to us that it is human social activity as the engine that drives the whole enterprise. created as a companion piece to gamedze’s also called , the film not only documents the work that gamedze does to articulate the musical aspect of his ideas—it also shows him and comrades and wrestling with the social and political implications of these ideas. what is history and who gets to make it? how do the events of the past shape our present and future? these are the primary themes that inform the album. the opener “turbulence’s pulse” sets the tone with a rich, searching piano and a monotone chant reminding us that “turbulent times call for extreme measures…” gamedze’s drum pattern here is a loose, swinging anchor holding the music together as the speaker reflects on how both musical time and historical time are created by humans working together. “wynter time” is a nine-minute epic of exploratory improvisation. after the ensemble opens, playing freely, the tune’s elegant, regal melody gives way to an inventive tenor sax solo by buddy wells. “locomotion” is a driving drum and percussion-heavy tune that showcases the band’s ability to marry bebop’s melodic conventions with open-eared free playing. robin fassie and wells’s solos on trumpet and tenor sax respectively are fierce and bassist thembinkosi mavimbela shines with a big, heavy tone and intricate lines. contrasting the more fiery pieces with softer, more contemplative moments, gamedze’s ensemble is capable of playing with great sensitivity and attention to detail on tunes like “melancholia” and “out stepped zim.” by now, jazz improvisation as a musical metaphor for liberal ideas about democracy is a well-worn and widespread cliché. despite this, there is something important to be gleaned from how this music has taught us to work together to change our circumstances. jazz and history have two essential things in common: they don’t exist without human initiative and collaboration. we are the driving force behind it all and by acknowledging and understanding that, we can write a new story as the future unfolds before us."

d6915,"bird hour 7ebra pop, indie rock is it time to conclusively redraw the boundaries of the all-too-prescriptive term “bedroom pop?” after all, garage and house music doesn’t need to have been played at their original namesakes—new york’s paradise garage and chicago’s warehouse—to be deemed legit. could an album concentrate, redefine, and update the genre of bedroom pop if it wasn’t literally made in a bedroom? the excellent debut from swedish duo , comprised of twins inez and ella johansson, suggests it might. as noted in the album’s liner notes, “the origins of 7ebra [started] with inez whiling away the hours playing guitar in her bedroom,” anticipating particular feel, its grain. the arrangements are sparse (each instrument seems siloed in its own wool-lined space), with production as warm and desiccated as a dusty sunlit sill. supposedly lacking a studio’s arsenal of sonic material, bedroom pop is typically made with limited resources—and though 7ebra did record in a studio (an important thing to note), they also reconfigure familiar sounds throughout: no-nonsense, slightly plastic-y organs; the clean-to-dirty-to-clean guitar tones; those dehydrated drums that , , and around an uncanny valley between real and fake. this minimalist approach is not imposed, but instead suggests a kind of deliberate, aesthetic hyper-restriction. there’s nothing slapdash about , though. the languid, lullaby-ish melodies on “rude boy,” “done with the day,” and “secretly bad” are deceptively simple; only a faultless convergence of feeling and precision achieves that super-subtle trace of grit in the delivery of the line “tell me a story where you pretend.” rich, deftly-layered harmonies on “lighter better” and “lean” overlap in such a way that they could be composed of five voices, as opposed to two. often panned left and right, the harmonies’ spacing suggests the sisters taking respective spaces around the same microphone, perhaps huddled together in a shared bedroom, a sock for a pop filter. sisterhood seems woven into the lyrics too. sly, shy, and diaristic, they’re filled with reflective phrases like “how the hell am i supposed to feel?” that seem directed inwards, or at a listener already familiar with the context. some lines have the stop-start prosody of a story relayed to a confidant, the adoption of different registers to flesh out the roles; a key dichotomy seems to be between what was said and what could have been said. the scattergun topics and heavy repetition of thoughts (“wakey wakey” and “born to care” both contain one line repeated ad infinitum) suggest either internal monologue or unloading onto someone close. “secretly bad,” “stripey horsey,” and “i have a lot to say” are characterized by sentiments and admissions often only possible in private. the close, airless quality of the vocals (notched with the faintest telephone eq) suggests voice notes recorded just after a messy emotional climax. though 7ebra’s music both evokes domestic space and seems created in domestic space, their praxis demands non-bedroom pop techniques in order to properly construct such perfectly-formed pocket symphonies. in stretching its parameters slightly too far, arrives at a meta, almost hyperreal version of bedroom pop, a kind of bedroom pop sublime."

d6925,"manzanita shana cleveland folk, singer-songwriter whether fronting rock band or on her own with an acoustic guitar, has spent her musical career peeking behind the veil of this world, and her oeuvre brims with songs about wandering other realms, communing with creatures who walk beside her unseen, wishing to fade from existence entirely or walk into the sun. but she’s thinking differently these days. “i am a ghost and i’m trying to show you what i do/ can i come through/ through you?,” cleveland sings on “a ghost,” the mellotron-tinged lullaby that opens , her second full-length under her own name. the supernatural imagery is typical for cleveland in addition to being something of a callback to the title track of 2019’s , where she also imagined herself a ghost. but whereas then cleveland took the point of view of a menacing presence who lurked in the walls and promised that “when i come for you/ i’ll freeze your blood,” on she seeks corporeal passage to a californian fantasia where love is real and spring returns eternally and the human body is a vessel for the most mystical of things: new songs and new souls. motherhood—specifically new motherhood—is the purview of . the songs were written while cleveland was pregnant and immediately after her son’s birth—nature’s very own side a and side b—and the record is a document of both the creation of a new life and a new way of living. it is also an ode to the rural part of california where cleveland lives with her son and partner, musician who contributes keyboards, dulcimer, glockenspiel, harpsichord, and synthesizer to (also here are and johnny goss on bass, and on pedal steel), and where she writes her songs outdoors all year round. as spring returns to the countryside, cleveland sees in its blooming a reflection of her own life moving from one season to the next. like its , is psychedelic folk music softly rendered as a vermeer—you’ll hear hypnotic fingerpicking, the squeak of fingers sliding steel strings, the low moan of a cello, chiming bells, warm washes of pedal steel, brushed cymbals, and gently pattering drums—but cleveland’s interpretation of psychedelia has changed, both sonically and spiritually. she’s applied lessons learned from , where time in ’s studio led her to the realization that the uncanny crackling of the natural world as it awakens from winter slumber is best conjured by the uncanny nature of synthesized sounds. augmented at times by low whooshes of white noise, a warbling of dappled keys, or a distant buzzing without an identifiable source, the songs on make no meaningful distinction between the real and the surreal. what, cleveland suggests, is more psychedelic than the sudden appearance of bugs in the bedroom on the first day of spring or catching a glimpse of a departed loved one in the face of her son as she plays her guitar on the porch? cleveland has lost none of her predilection for the eerie, though she deploys it to different ends now. “quick winter sun,” a tale of being caught out by a short winter’s day—notably the only song on set in that season and one that feels less overtly californian than inspired by british folk acts of the 1960s—turns post-apocalyptic mid-way through. ”look, we’re the last humans,” she sings, describing a fumbling walk down a trail in the dark as swallows return to “their houses of mud.” on the spoken word interlude “ten hour drive through west coast disaster,” accompanied only by mellotron, cleveland juxtaposes seeing flames over mount shasta and “cattle farms out of horror films” with the appearance of rainbows refracted by crystals in a waterfall, her son laughing in her ear—joy and terror existing in the same place. “will you find a way to love this world?” she wonders. yet as much as is a record about the outdoors, it shines in its depictions of interior spaces, which often feel more fantastical than the californian wilderness where the record is otherwise set. “gold tower” is perhaps apex in this respect, a love song from expectant mother to unborn child so intimate it feels a privilege to be allowed to hear it. cleveland conjures a world within a world, a liminal meeting place for two on a still night after rain, her voice glowing with emotion as she sings to her “quiet little one made of see-through skin” and marvels at her expanding capacity for love. the defining characteristic of cleveland’s music has always been its beauty and is no different: it is a record of beautiful things and beautiful feelings transposed into beautiful songs beautifully played. but what’s new is her sense of serenity. the undercurrent of yearning to know what is unknowable once omnipresent in cleveland’s work has been quelled—”melted with the snow,” as she sings on “gold tower.” the world is no longer a mystery to be solved but simply one to behold and, moreover, one to trust. where she once fashioned the coming of spring as a precursor to loss, a gift delivered with fingers crossed—“as sure as spring/ coats our little piece of land in green/ the turning earth takes all of what it brings,” goes on the —now she writes movingly of the what it brings back."

(ill-fated because, you know, 2020; the record itself was quite good.) yet shone brightest when rose went from superficial to super-real, dropping themselves into the terrifying moment when the main-character-of-their-own-life becomes cognizant of how much has been lost in the quest to follow their heart—and how desperately they wish to hit reset on it all. alas! no do overs in this world. what now? the “now” is what rose grapples with on , an unflinching chronicle of a dark night of the soul with all the swelling violas and spanish guitars and flickering harps such high drama deserves, crammed through a purview so small and personal it could fit neatly inside a jewelry box. the record has something of a storyline the way life sometimes has a storyline—a terrible break up, a season passed in the swamp of self-doubt—but rose is not playing a character, for once. this is them, these are their feelings and this is what they are: rejection, regret, desperation, and sadness. far from being a drag, is revelatory. as a songwriter, rose has never been better; as an arranger, doubly so. in contrast to slick synthetic textures, splits the difference between experimental, modular sounds and manipulated analog flourishes that convey the unreliable qualities of memory, alternately mutating, degrading, or coming into heartbreakingly sharp focus, looping back and forth on itself in an endless cycle in search of an exit. the result is a record that feels constructed to mimic the uncomfortable feelings of rumination that accompany periods of deep personal growth. rose is fearless in their expression. on “miami,” they wrestle with the pain of rejection over frantic instrumentation that escalates like a panic attack until rose is nearly wailing the chorus. “this is the hard part/ the part that they don’t tell you about,” they sing, their voice growing hoarser with each word. “there is the art of loving/ this is the art of forgetting how.” on the shimmery, slinky “the kiss,” rose attempts to soothe their shattered heart with the kiss from someone new and plasticine ’80s pop—“i would do most anything,” they whimper, their tone as downcast as it is desperate. throughout rose mines their own memories for bits of comfort both cold and common sense—their mother tells them to stop victimizing themself; there’s a song about their therapist (“jill says”). in an inspired artistic choice, interspersed between the songs are clips of voicemails left for rose by their grandmother, mee maw, who showers them with message after message of unconditional adoration: i miss you, i love you, i am always thinking about you—a potent reminder that there are kinds of love that remain constant even if the mind itself deteriorates. do things improve for our intrepid rose? sort of. not really. no. well? maybe. by the time rose arrives at the closing track “where do i go from here?” they’re still at war with their conscience over the inability to let go of things they cannot change. “take all this pain and learn to love yourself again,” sings the angel of rose’s better nature. “shut up,” is the reply to this pointless platitude. some things are too painful to ever be forgotten, but they be transmuted. “the memories live on in this song,” concludes rose. amen to that."

d6946,"anarchist gospel sunny war folk on , nashville guitarist, singer, and songwriter sydney lyndella ward—also known as sunny war—navigates a binary as old as black american music itself. in an effort to stamp out the rich cultural reservoirs from which african people drew strength and identity, african music and traditional religion were effectively banned on plantations throughout the united states. africans were allowed to attend church, smuggling the expressive power of their religion and music into the church behind the facade of christianity. thus, the black church became the sole refuge where enslaved africans could cut loose from the daily cycle of surveillance and punishment that stifled every other aspect of their lives. this cruel dynamic created a divide between the sacred and the spiritual where none had existed before. with its thematic dance between good and evil and its stylistic mixture of gospel with the blues, country, and rock n’ roll, embodies all of this history. the album’s opener, “love’s death bed,” tackles love and loss as ward speaks directly to a lover who she promises will be her “last heartbreak.” we listen in as their relationship dissolves as the beautiful chorus “on love’s death bed, i lay my bouquet of flowers / on love’s death bed, i cry away our final hours.” drives the final nail into the coffin. “no reason” is a treatise on human duality wrapped up in an upbeat country-rock tune. over a popping groove and swooning background vocals, ward describes a person who struggles to reconcile the best and worst aspects of their character. it’s a brilliantly executed song. “i got no fight” is a fantastic example of weariness as an emotional and thematic device commonly used in both the blues and gospel music. when ward sings “been up all night waiting for day to come. i want it over long before it’s done”, she embodies the feeling of weariness in the blues: a deep, unshakable emotional fatigue that comes from being black in an anti-black world. beautifully played and full of ward’s moving vocal performances (check her gorgeous cover of dionne farris’ “hopeless”), is a stellar work of art. by reconciling the emotional, political, and spiritual dichotomies that have characterized so much black music, ward shows us that wholeness is possible."

d6959,"nivraym (revisited) koenjihyakkei experimental arriving in the world of unprepared is like leaping into a tornado that spins you dizzy and spits you into the midst of a meteor shower that deposits you underneath an avalanche. but the tornado is made of fire, the meteors have started a band, and the avalanche is bellowing at you in a made-up language. drumming mastermind tatsuya yoshida of radical art/noise duo founded koenjihyakkei in early ‘90s tokyo. ever since, they’ve been among the premier practitioners of , the utterly singular blend of prog, jazz, and wagnerian opera that originated in the early ‘70s by french freaks and eventually . the band’s third album came barreling into being in 2001, and was tweaked in 2009 with overdubs by the latest lineup. now a newly revisited has been remixed, remastered, re-sequenced, and given its first-ever vinyl version. what emerges is a beast that bears the original release’s blend of maniacal precision and brute force but adds some new mojo all its own. with yoshida as its fulcrum and only constant, koenjihyakkei has always taken the first-gen vision of zeuhl—a genre synonymous with visceral power—and intensified it a thousandfold into an unrelenting assault on the senses. while doesn’t quite bear the demonic, sulfur-infused vibe of vintage magma, it quadruples down on the knuckle-busting, prog/fusion side of things. from the breakneck frenzy of “lussesoggi zomn” and “vissqguell” to the knotty, zappa-like twists and turns of “vallczeremdoss” and the merciless slam of “maschtervoz” and “gassitrumm,” the band executes death-defying riffs and time changes with such intensity, it’s a wonder the players survived the sessions. as their spellcheck-immune song titles attest, koenjihyakkei emulates magma by singing in a self-invented language, frequently in strident, sinister choral arrangements that make it sound like a phalanx of valkyries on winged serpents descending from the sky. in between all the punishing rhythms and dizzying riffs, the band sometimes switches things up by adding some wild avant-jazz progressions, but nowhere on will you encounter anything like a respite from the sonic carnage. the remastering makes it seem like the whole album has gone from black and white to blazing, retina-searing technicolor, and the remix goes far beyond topping off the treble or bulking up the bottom end. it brings in elements that were completely absent before, like the foreboding guitar riffs on the title track’s chaotic coda or the vocals leading into the cataclysmic climax of “gassttrumm.” if that’s not enough, we get live 2020 bonus versions of three tracks, which add a whole new perspective. the live take on “nivraym,” for instance, shifts the focus from keyboards to angry guitar and expands things considerably with a spacy, almost gong-like middle section. like the rest of koenjihyakkei’s catalog, isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s got a lot to offer zeuhl zealots and anyone else with a taste for extremes. even those who’ve internalized the album’s earlier versions may find this go-round to be something of a revelation."
d6960,"memoirs of hi-tech jazz waajeed electronic, techno even before the release of 2022 was already shaping up as ’s watershed year. for over two decades, the producer/dj born robert o’bryant has been among detroit beat music’s stalwarts, creating tracks and initiating the inherent links between the city’s hip-hop and dance music, a community connector of rare social and artistic dimension. this year, waajeed’s role in ’s crew and the group received proper historical context in , dan charnas’ wonderful biography of the late hip-hop legend; and he helped open , a community-minded, music production school, alongside compatriots from the detroit scene. waajeed, who was himself expertly mentored (by some of the best, including dilla’s guide , and mad mike banks of underground resistance/ur), is very much invested in simultaneously looking backwards and forwards. so it makes perfect sense that from its title on, , his first full-length since 2018, reflects what’s already gone down and previews potential futures. spotlights not only waajeed’s story but the alliances within a black musical tradition often segregated by genre-minded separatists and its role in local cultural history. “hi-tech jazz” was a hugely influential early ‘00s track by galaxy 2 galaxy, a “group” within the fabled (and deeply political) ur crew; it affirmed techno’s relationship to the improvised nature of dance music while nodding to the city’s own specific electronic tradition (“hi-tech soul” was originally one of derrick may’s nomenclature alternatives for the music which came to be known as “techno”). waajeed makes these connections explicit. is bathed in horns and strings, driven by well-placed narratives and unexpected contributors (local rapper black nix and , senior pastor at san francisco’s church of john coltrane). it’s personal and communal, a call to arms and a product of joy, the beautiful creation of black detroit through and through. sonically, the title tells no lies: is basically a classic detroit techno album replete with jazz textures, many of them courtesy of , whose myriad credits extend from ur to ’s group, and who’s become central to the city’s current evolution. (de’sean is also all over compilation, which is in some ways a sibling to .) jones’ sax and ewi, as well as his string arrangements, are featured on nearly every track, instantly expanding the palette of 808s and 909s that are waajeed’s primary weapons. and these horns—often including frank alowishus’ trumpet and khristian foreman’s trombone—are not here to simply solo over open beatscapes, as is the deep house norm. when they’re not woven deeply into the fabric of these dance tracks, syncopating alongside the percussion lines or sequenced synths, the horns affirm and recontextualize waajeed’s wistful melodies (long a hallmark of his productions), bringing the music into a new space. “the ballad of robert o’bryant,” for instance, moves from the sounds of documentary crime scenes into electronic marching band music, beautiful horn lines evocative of mid-’70s soul flirting with layers of drum machines. the first single “motor city madness” opens with minimalist jacking, evoking the city’s classic “hi-tech” sound; but not a minute in, trombone and sax asides (individual, but often in harmony) begin appearing in the crevices. soon the horns syncopate into formation, and by the end, a wonderful theme appears, and a classic is born. the closing “remember” opens with meditative piano chords and mid-tempo 808 handclaps before a line of jones’ harmonizing horns ushers it into wonderfully redemptive jazz-house territory. is a stunning journey, surely familiar to any listener or dancer who knows how detroit has helped reshape global rhythm, yet also fresh with possibility. waajeed knows the lineage; now, he’s very much part of it."

d6962,"mirrored vanessa wagner classical, contemporary classical french classical pianist first explored minimalism in 2016 with the release of , a collaborative record with producer that matched her intimate interpretations with electronics. it planted the seed for her next records, showing how wagner’s meticulous yet fluid technique can unlock deep feelings: 2019’s and march 2022’s both emphasize a sense of poignancy and reflection. her latest release continues along the same path, but this time, wagner showcases her flexibility, effortlessly bouncing between fast-paced rhythms and serene contemplation to illustrate the potent emotions hidden within the simplest of melodies. while all the pieces wagner plays on can be categorized as minimalist, they each come to the style from a different lens. ’s and ’ works highlight an early generation of western minimalist composers, while camille pépin, whose impressionistic works branch out of the 20th century american avant-garde, represents the current trajectory. s work draws inspiration from electronic music and composers like john cage, bridging styles and disciplines. while each piece offers a slightly different perspective, wagner seamlessly pairs them, emphasizing the subtlest changes in tone. throughout, wagner’s nuanced playing creates a delicate flow. during glass’ rumbling “étude no. 4,” she powerfully strokes each note, letting her tempo ebb and flow with the motion of the music. glass’ lamenting “étude no. 2” comes next, and wagner changes over to rounded, elongated tones, creating a sense of deep rumination. but it’s pepin’s “number 1” that best showcases wagner’s flexibility: at first, she strikes her piano with a thunderous rhythm, gradually lightening up with each pulse of a heart-wrenching melody. in just a few minutes, she changes again, playing airy, twinkly pitches with a gentle touch, and by the end, she reaches a state of buoyancy, energetically leaping between each note, only to fade back down to a sense of moody reflection. the final two pieces on , melaine dalibert’s “six + six” and ’s “mineral,” both conjure a sense of radiant meditation, finding a moment of solace after the vigor of earlier tracks like pepin’s. here, wagner’s playing is at its most delicate and vulnerable, letting each note ring with a mix of wistfulness and dreaminess, leaving us in a state of gentle reverie that echoes long after the notes have finished. it’s a fitting way to end the record, one final reminder that simplicity doesn’t have to be surface-level—it can cut right to the heart."
d6963,"atalaya dezron douglas on , the latest full-length from dezron douglas, the bassist and bandleader is supported by an ensemble of gifted players: on piano and keys; joe dyson jr. on drums; and emilio modeste on saxophones. the result is a fresh set of songs that are beautifully played and teeming with life. the album opens with the sound of a lone clave before the full band kicks in for the title track. douglas, burton, and dyson build a solid rhythmic foundation so that modeste can fly on tenor. the band eases the tempo for “rosé,” a lovely ballad where burton’s piano chords play nicely against douglas’ warm, round tone, setting the stage for a melodic, exploratory solo from modeste. burton’s solo on “rosé” is inventive, with long, winding melodic lines that flow into rich chords and clusters. toward the end of “rosé,” the quartet rises to a climax, shedding the understated feel of the opening section and playing together with fire and intensity. “coyoacån” kicks the tempo back up, with the band locking in and improvising at a furious pace. douglas’ playing on the tune is particularly exciting, seamlessly flowing between solid, walking basslines and daring free playing. burton’s piano and dyson’s thunderous drumming create an open, abstract space before the band reconvenes for the song’s soaring main melody. “jones beach” opens slowly and intentionally with dyson’s cymbals and modeste’s melodic lines conjuring a grand, regal atmosphere from the tune. “more coffee please” finds douglas laying down a nimble, head-bopping bassline as dyson swings alongside him with staccato chords from burton. modeste’s solo is playful and evocative and, as they do on much of the album, the band strikes a balance between bop and free playing. part of strength lies in the fact that it offers an exciting set of new interpretations of the jazz tradition. like much of the best jazz being made today, shines by filtering tradition through the minds, ears, and hands of a talented group of contemporary players."

d6972,"everything returns black ox orkestar folk montréal post-everything quartet has always dealt in a sort of cultural timelessness. thierry amar (bass), scott gilmore (cimbalom, piano, vocals), gabriel levine (clarinet, guitar, vocals), and jessica moss (violin, vocals) first got together at the turn of the century to create what they refer to as modern jewish diasporic folk music, with lyrics mostly in yiddish. listening to 2004’s revelatory debut , and the equally fantastic 2006 follow-up , it’s easy to imagine them popping up in history as a jazz band or a balkan folk outfit, a yiddish theater troupe, or participants in the north american of the ’70s and ’80s. by melding these disparate threads of the jewish diaspora together, and applying a fresh coat of post-punk polish, the band arrives at a hauntingly beautiful sound. , black ox orkestar’s new album, marks their first full-length since 2006, and only their second recording since returning from a 15-year hiatus. while the name of the album is a reference to the idea that so much of the past is here again—its liner notes address the refugee crisis and re-emergence of fascism around the world—this is also certainly a bit of a tongue-in-cheek comment about the band reuniting. while there have been contextualizing the history and culture of judaism within diy music—examples include , , and many of the artists on john zorn’s tzadik records, from to deveykus—what black ox orkestar is doing has always felt very unique, and is no exception. this is jewish music, (a term that roughly translates as “jewishness”), presented in a way that can be enjoyed both by those with strong connections to the community and those from outside it. there’s a good reason that the band’s first release since reuniting was a 7-inch flexi that went out to subscribers of the magazine , which describes itself as “committed to the rich tradition of thought, activism, and culture of the jewish left.” that being said, a knowledge of judaism isn’t necessary to be able to appreciate what black ox is doing, though everyone would benefit from reading the extensive liner notes. lyrically, black ox draws on universal themes of exile, anti-fascism, and the intricacies of identity. radical politics have also played an outsized role in their message and mission. touches on topics including war, immigration, generational trauma, and popular uprisings across the globe, sometimes all in the same song. for example, in “mizrakh mi ma’arav,” the band parallels the deportation of jews during the holocaust to concentration camps in the east with the plight of syrians desperately trying to flee that country’s ongoing civil war to the west. as the narrator of the song shifts from one to the other, so does the language the band is singing in, as well as the music itself. the result is a kind of mosaic, juxtaposing notes and words from across europe and the middle east in a heady whirlwind of yiddish and arabic, clarinet, and a violin that would sound just as much at home on a . even if you don’t understand yiddish (or hebrew, arabic, french, and english, the other languages on the record) it’s clear just from listening to these songs that so much of this album is a celebration of continued existence. it might sound melancholy at times but really so is life. the overall tone, the spirit of the music, it’s one of hope for a better tomorrow. the final two tracks are a perfect example of that: a moldovan , a type of jewish folk dance, is followed up by “lamed-vovnik a cabaret-like jazz tune about the jewish legend of the who keep the world in order and how we are always one misstep away from destruction. the album ends with gilmore repeating “everything falls” in english, words that serve as both a reminder as well as a kind of prayer to try and break the cycles of trauma that rule so much of our lives. everything falls. but also, everything returns."

(that said, the band’s singers swell with venezuelan pride and promise to do right by his country on the title track. although they also remember to mention that venezuelan girls are stunning and dance the best rumba.) on “las 12,” he is forlorn as he watches the front door, desperate and clingy the moment she finally returns, then sours on her before the song is over. he’d die without her love on “alma rosa”; he bemoans her jealous ways on “la envidia.” he considers fighting a married woman’s husband after getting lost in her smile (and then some) on “el amor de una mujer”. married or not, the love of a woman — the more torturous, the better — is fertile creative ground for moncho y su banda. she’s always just out of reach, but 40 years on, is as accessible as ever."

d6991,"se ve desde aquí mabe fratti experimental ’s work is defined by the way she weaves simple melodies into rich symphonies. on her acclaimed 2021 album the guatemala-born, mexico city-based cellist and composer paired her breathy vocals with sweet cello and rich electronics to create radiant compositions. later that year, she released , a collaboration with sound artist consisting of blown-out melodies built from tiny phrases. where those albums often worked with complementary patterns, makes intricate music out of striking contrasts. it’s an evolution for fratti, one that explores the push-and-pull between consonance and dissonance to tell a story of personal transformation. the album derives its dark, raw sound from the instruments that swirl around fratti’s fervent cello and feathery voice: synth, guitar, and bass from héctor tosta; synth and tapes loops from ; violins from ; drums from ; and sax from . fratti’s lyrics, which glide above the instruments, speak of the desire to change—to become something that’s still just out of reach. her music mimics those themes in its search for balance, the way it teeters between moments of chaos and warmth. most of the tracks build from an oscillating melody or bass line, then branch out by adding new textures on top. the backbone might be as straightforward as the syncopated, deep plucking that runs through “desde el cielo,” or as invigorating as the bristling cello tones and electronics on “con esfuerzo.” while each element ultimately gels, there are moments when the music disintegrates into tense uncertainty—“cada músculo,” for example, changes from a buoyant pop track into an apprehensive instrumental. but the song’s layers never come undone, a testament to fratti’s careful attention to detail. penultimate track, “deja de empujar” feels like a culmination of fratti’s interests in contrast: it’s a finely woven tapestry that hangs by a thread, yet somehow still holds together. fratti’s voice slips between the arpeggiating saxophone, gliding cello, and retro synth buzzes. her lyrics are turbulent, too, asking: “¿ ” (“what is my body asking for?/ stop pushing”). the music is off-balance, but it feels direct, reliably finding its footing amidst the mayhem. by the end of the album, fratti has found a sense of contentment. there are a few static pulses and a few eerie twinkles on “siempre tocas algo,” but fratti’s voice—accompanied by bright cello harmonics and resonant electronics—emerges to take over, charting a course out of turmoil and into the light. fratti’s work has always reflected her expertise in crafting gently layered, thoughtful music. but now, she digs deeper, showing the ways that tension may ultimately bring the greatest kind of catharsis."
d6992,"njyhi nok cultural ensemble jazz in addition to the physical, psychological, political, and economic anguish and destruction that the trans-atlantic slave trade and colonialism wreaked upon the african diaspora, these conjoined historical epochs have also made a dramatic and lasting impact on african diasporic culture. as the material summation of a people’s creative life, culture is both an indicator of where a people are and a determinant of where they might go. it is as the great cape verdean and guinea-bissauan revolutionary amílcar cabral once : “culture is simultaneously the fruit of a people’s history and a determinant of history.” as the european empires of old overran west and central africa, the pillaging of artifacts from ancient indigenous cultures was common. one such culture, the nok of nigeria, was known for their beautifully composed terracotta sculptures which currently reside in french and english museums far removed from the people whose ancestors created them. in conceiving the nok cultural ensemble’s debut album , british-nigerian drummer meditated on and studied the nok artifacts. the result is a collection of songs that are practically vibrating with the rhythmic, melodic, and emotional power of africa and its diaspora. ’s title track serves as both the album’s opener and a tone-setter. for the intro, the ensemble builds up a cloud of interplaying percussion, drums, whistles and the sprawling sound of a tape delay. after reaching a furious climax, “njhyi” gives way to the slow, head-bopping rhythm of “awakening.” the tubist ( ) guests on “awakening,” swinging subtly against the beat with breathy melodic lines. “sang awun” picks the tempo up significantly as hand drums play deftly alongside a steady, driving groove. like much of the music throughout , “sang awun” is primarily made up of percussion instruments. despite this, the composition doesn’t lack in timbral color or in the complexity of its arrangement. as the piece’s rapid-fire snares enter and play off of the hand drums, it is evident that this is in no way limited simply because it is drum-centric. considering the countless lives, memories and culture lost due to the historical tragedies of colonization and enslavement, there is something healing and invigorating about this music. the rhythms that wakili-hick and the nok cultural ensemble have conjured on are not just music for the sake of music. these sounds are heavy with intention and aligned with the ancient african conception of rhythm as a conduit of information, tradition, history, and culture."

d6997,"recordar é viver: antologia vol​.​1 pedro lima world in 2020, the swiss label bongo joe kicked off a crucial reissue series highlighting the music emanating from the tiny west african island republics of são tomé and príncipe. situated a few hundred kilometers off the coast of gabon on the main continent, the small islands fell under portuguese rule for centuries. the colonialists used the island to force enslaved africans to work the plantations there. as a result, a veritable melting pot of music and culture from africa began to mingle there. starting with , you could begin to hear the way that these small, vital islands cooked down the sounds of angolan semba, congolese soukous, cape verdean coladeira, and kenyan benga, adding heavy dashes of outside sounds from haiti, brazil, and the west indies. and yet the sound of these islands is irreducible. bongo joe soon followed that collection up with , the thrilling 1985 album from pedro lima, perhaps the most crucial artist to ever emerge from são tomé and príncipe. when your sobriquet is “a voz do povo de são tomé” (“the people’s voice of the island”), you know you’re at the source. but were it not for the rescue of the aging tapes in são tomé’s radio archive, most of lima’s exuberant, joyous music would have gone unheard. thankfully, bongo joe now bless listeners with a generous and ecstatic 12-track set, . lima began his music career as a teen, forming his band os leonenses with family members in the 1960s, well before the island achieved independence from portugal. he originally manned the tumbas, the conga-like drums, as well as the bass, before the band’s lead singer dropped out of a gig last minute. the crowd was so taken by lima’s relaxed yet moving singing, that he was soon the frontman. but while, on the surface, lima’s voice is all grace, don’t be fooled by his relaxed delivery: his lyrics are some of the most outspoken on the island, a truth-teller in the years leading up to the revolution and in its wake. he remained vital and beloved in his country until his passing in 2019. lima evokes the continent’s greats: he could be as driving and endlessly melodic as franco and t.p. ok jazz, as expansive as king sunny ade, as politically outspoken and engaged as fela kuti, yet as smooth as tabu ley rochereau. start with “ami cu manu mu,” with its bright, ever-unfurling melodic lines and incessant puxa rhythm (a mutation of angolan rebita) propelling things along at a clip. there’s a banquet of sounds to entice you: the back-and-forth between lima and backing vocalists, the delirious interweaving patterns laid down by guitarists leopoldino silva and pety-zorro. it all drives a dancefloor stomper that has lima calling out the corrupt politicians of the island while cagily shrouding it all in metaphor. and somewhere near the midway point, lima and band suddenly hit another gear, the hi-hats pistoning and electric organ pulsing, sending everything higher into the stratosphere. “subocha” seems to arise out of the island jungle, opening with bird calls and whistles and a percolating hand drum underneath. slowly, the guitars emerge and entwine like plant roots. lima’s voice glides across the tune like a cloud in the afternoon sky. most tracks near the seven-minute mark, and almost any number here is an occasion for an outsider to hear one of africa’s best-kept musical secrets, yet another titan hiding in plain sight."
d6998,"green of winter battle trance classical, modern jazz calling a new release a “record” feels incomplete, a grasp at a convenient shorthand. “achievement” is probably the best word that can be used to encapsulate hearing the saxophone quartet’s remarkable ability to, like ants, construct and wield masses of sound vastly out of proportion to their bodies. a new battle trance record is invariably accompanied by details of the work’s grueling genesis. the group’s leader puts the other tenor players— , matt nelson, and jeremy viner—through rehearsals that the notes for their first release, , compare to martial arts training, while release notes saw laplante describe its writing phase as “the most torturous and demanding compositional experience of my life.” their latest record, , doesn’t shirk on this: a 19-day retreat of typically lengthy rehearsals in vermont preceded the recording, and label press materials make note of “laplante’s rigorous, decade-long compositional studies with author, w.a. mathieu.” (via email, laplante says concludes a planned trilogy of compositions for the group.) yet, as occasionally harrowing as is, it’s a concluding step in a 10-year journey for the group and mandatory listening for anyone with even a passing interest in hearing the boundaries of music gleefully pushed. as moves through laplante’s compositional roster of overtone playing, notes sung through the saxophones, and dense, rippling arpeggios, it does so with remarkable clarity and purpose. hearing single-instrument groups at length can get tiresome, but laplante’s very good about using the saxophone’s set of extended techniques to vary the timbres of the music. the first and longest of the three movements opens with eerie breathing and whispering sounds before the group begins singing and clicking their instruments’ keys; it’s nearly five minutes into the piece before sounds conventionally “saxophone-ish” occur. all that said, , when compared to the band’s previous works, clocks a number of departures for the band. it’s the first—on bandcamp at least—to list the engineering, mixing, and mastering personnel and its materials also make mention of the space in which it was recorded (putney, vermont’s big barn). laplante has also made the work’s score and the cumulative effect of these additions is a social widening of battle trance’s gyre, a new angle on a very tight-knit, insular ensemble. it’s battle trance’s 10th year as an ensemble, and while i don’t love the cliche of the group “maturing”—anyone putting this level of effort into composing and performing is not going to change up their sound simply due to age— does feel like an end-statement. laplante revisits some of the major-key ensemble sections from and explains that “there are echoes of musical themes and feelings that purposefully exist on more than one album, kind of like hidden threads that weave them together if one listens closely.” the piece ends with all four men singing a simple melodic line while they keep up a flutter of keys, a lovely capstone for the trilogy. of course, this could be because was very much a pandemic project. we’ve all emerged—at least as much as that word applies to an ongoing situation—from covid-19 as different people. but one can still draw comfort from the fury and challenge of battle trance: the world turns, the great sea yearns, the ants go marching on."

d7000,"first of the brooklyn cowgirls mimi roman country in the 1950s and early ‘60s, mimi roman did just about everything she could to become a successful country singer: she learned how to play the guitar; she performed in talent shows; she signed to the renowned decca records label and recorded tunes and toured all over the place; she even altered her name and concocted an origin story—that she grew up in small-town california, not brooklyn, new york—she thought might appeal to country fans. critics and radio djs liked her clarion voice and her winning personality, but not quite enough; roman never scored a real hit, and before she turned 30, she more or less left the industry, choosing instead to stay close to home and sing for commercials, films, and other less glamorous jobs. roman’s striking talent and truncated career arc made her a prime candidate for an archival release, and in 2012 the reissue label bear family records compiled her singles and released them as a cd called . now, is digging deeper for its compilation , which features previously unreleased demos, radio, and tv performances and recordings sourced from 78rpm acetate discs in roman’s personal collection. as is typical for such a release, the 25 tracks on vary in sound quality, with some sporting a layer of hiss that only adds to the historical charm of the release. and many tracks are live performances, accompanied by audience applause and preceded by an introduction, occasionally delivered by roman herself but more often by men like arthur godfrey, host of his own variety show called (1948-58). the first nine tracks of this collection focus on roman’s appearances on the program, including a performance of “i’m the one who loves you” that showcases the sturdy elegance of her voice, and a version of hank williams’ “weary blues from waitin’” that juxtaposes a baroque orchestral arrangement with yodeling. at the end of this section, godfrey exclaims: “by golly, mimi, you don’t come from very far west, but you sure can sing those songs.” the rest of the compilation traces roman’s journey through old-time radio shows and military gigs, with distinctive covers of famous songs and cuts of tunes written by her husband at the time, paul evans. highlights include ’s “rocky road blues” done with perfect western swing pep, a cozy countrypolitan number (and suspected promo for marathon oil) called “he’s my marathon man” and a skeletal run through ’s “folsom prison blues.” on the traditional song “born in east virginia,” roman sounds authentically appalachian, but on “you’re the one,” she sounds like she could’ve been a motown artist. and when you listen to her torch-song take on floyd tillman’s “i gotta have my baby back,” it’s very easy to imagine roman as a -sized figure in country music history; if only she’d caught the right breaks at the right time, she may very well have become a star. because no matter the situation or the style of the music, her voice is powerful but approachable, and reliably vibrant. she may not be a household name, but decades later, mimi roman still jumps from the speakers and demands that you listen."

d7027,"the antidote suite jovia armstrong & eunoia society jazz there is power in the continuity of musical storytelling. the longer it persists, the stronger, more influential, and more original the music becomes. this is doubly so when a musical narrative starts out already imbued with community intentions then picks up each ensuing generation’s ideas on the subject, embedding that continuity with new hopes and dreams; warnings and examples; sounds and forms. this is how traditions are born, and few contemporary cultural traditions match the power of great black music. artists with the vision to recognize its full breadth (rather than simply serving it piecemeal via genre categorization) work on an immense canvas; and as time continues to collapse, musicians presenting the breadth of that tradition are addressing nothing less than the full bore of history. this is the context of jovia armstrong’s , the drummer-educator-technologist’s second album under her own name, and a rich document of this diasporic musical continuum from a contemporary perspective. featuring music written and produced by armstrong, performed with violinist leslie deshazor plus a few community guests, and originally commissioned to accompany the traveling group art show , is an expansive, mostly instrumental work, a soundtrack to the moment when old delineations stop making sense, and intersectionality is less code than new reality—when, as jason mcdaniel’s liner notes say, “the collective consciousness of black music is more fluid…than ever before.” armstrong is well-versed to tackle the moment, as she’s long subscribed to this fluidity. the multi-instrumentalist grew up in detroit, mentored by the drummer (whose own roots in the tradition stretch from to ), and has been operating in motor city and chicago’s diverse musical spaces for nearly 20 years. her vocals and rhythms have accompanied a host of different musicians: she appears on recordings by, among others, aacm composer nicole mitchell ( ) and house don (who adapted and remixed armstrong’s song, “gullah geechee”); she’s a member of jc brooks’s retro-soul-punk band and the all-female, strings and drums quartet, ; she has been an in-demand touring drummer, and operated a community music school on the south side. for armstrong, fluidity is the fuel. and the power of is how naturally all the parts flow together. with mitchell’s flute, ’s guitar, isaiah sharkey’s bass, and amr fahmy’s rhodes augmenting deshazor’s amplified strings, armstrong’s stripped-down kit, and tactfully added electronic post-production, the textures hint at some near-future sound of global jazz. (the gorgeous mitchell- and armstrong-led “meditations on oya,” in fact, echoes ’s similarly minded “stretch music.”) but this is less about solo playing than how the compositions invite each musician to interact with the material and the tradition, creating music that sounds yearning, multivalent, and futuristic. imitating its title, “breathe” rises and falls on waves of parker’s distortions, deshazor’s violin, and armstrong’s cymbals, creating a cascading science fiction desert sound. “shades and shapes” rises as a guitar/keys/hi-hat funk configuration, before mutating into a kind of middle eastern dance tune that showcases deshazor, then disappearing into the near-ambient space-age electronics of fahmy’s rhodes. best of all is the radical interplay on the ’s one vocal track: at its start, “zebra” places the great chicago singer yaw agyeman in front of an incomparable production that has the feeling of d’angelo’s but as a lo-fi dub experience, before introducing teh’ray hale’s rap, delivered over laid-back rimshots and glitchy, virus-like blasts. for the rest of the track, the music and the voices keep transforming—the second half is essentially a dub remix of the first—as though the mixing board’s ghosts are getting involved in the storytelling. the elements they add are already part of this tradition (see: lee perry, cx kidtronik), but what jovia armstrong’s does is put them on an equal sonic footing with all the others—continuing what came before, making sure it has another place to go."

d7049,"papillon de nuit: the night butterfly tanika charles r&b/soul is there a corner of contemporary music where the margin between enduring triumph and retro cliche is as razor-thin as throwback soul? it’s a style whose recorded elements are mass-produced with precision—part of pop’s everyday furniture—yet which occasionally exudes such aesthetic thrills that its cultural reserve feels bottomless. this is a good lens through which to value toronto-based singer , who’s been squeezing modernity out of classic soul for over a decade, tweaking a set of timeworn musical values that, under her control, retain a natural outsized potency. charles is there for lovers of sharp kiss-off r&b scorchers, and the gut-wrenching ballads with the tsunami vocals, mixing unfiltered emotions with comedic double entendres. she satisfies the heads attuned to the tone of hollow-body electric guitars, fender rhodes keys, and vox organs, backed by rim-shots, handclaps, and shuffles from the funky drummer’s handbook. her productions satisfy connoisseurs who regard 1965-72 as the apex of studio feels and small-group arrangements, but who also admire a well-placed rap feature, synth preset, or small sonic tricks that allow them to forego a calendar glance. charles’s recordings do all that—and lend her specialty soul a commercial appeal, without abandoning the artistic principles it’s been forged on. those values, and the accompanying sounds, continue to be central on charles’s third album, —yet the music also stretches far beyond simple definitions. if the sweetly stylized background voices and well-placed horn sections floating over the taut bass-drums riddims remain bedrocks behind charles’s powerhouse lead, the increasingly airy keyboards and the warm empty space in the album’s overall mix often hint at newer, quieter storms, or a different kind of club. the jazzy guitar and electric piano chords, staccato back-up singers, and charles’s breathy delivery on “frustrated” give off the lush feel of a late ‘70s/early ‘80s quincy jones classic (or prince’s “ballad of dorothy parker”). and no one would be the wiser if the tight production of “different morning,” with its guest verse by toronto rapper , was regarded as downtempo house music. then again, charles’s previously lived-in spaces also create great simple pleasures: “paintbrush and a palette” is one of those popping-fun metaphor-driven delicacies (with a reserved wink to the ) that any music row writer would be proud of. and “hold me (like a grudge),” a heartfelt, funk guitar-driven midtempo number about a love affair being stifled, could be the dictionary definition of classic soul music, unpacking emotional complication with melancholy minor chords, biting wordplay, and a juxtaposition of charles’s yearning for better and her background singers’s cooing of melody. it could have been set to tape at any point in the last five decades, without ever seeming out of place."
d7050,"crime of passing crime of passing punk, post-punk ’s 2016 demo offered a cold, lo-fi take on post-punk, with buzzy keys, low, haunting vocals, and hard industrial drums. three releases later, the cincinnati band has morphed from a solo project into a five-piece, in the process embracing a fuller sound while carrying forward their unpretentious coldwave roots. on this stellar , layers of sound expertly dance over one another, as on the slinky “hunting knife,” with snippets of skronky horns, krautrock-style effects, and electronic drums. the songs are mostly new. two show up on earlier releases, though these versions are brighter, clearer, as if glowing with white-hot energy. the record makes the case for proceeding slowly and steadily; the band sounds as if it’s really had a chance to grow into a mature, cohesive unit. these days, andie luman has taken over lead vocal duties from the band’s founder dakota carlyle. she masterfully sets the mood of each track, from the whispers on the new-wave-y “vision talk” to the echoey cries on the eerie, hard-edged “damrak.” crime of passing often harks back to an early ‘80s sound, like on the darkly pop “ways of hiding”—not unlike texas band —but it does so without being kitschy. luman’s voice rings true; her words feel urgent and tinged with romantic desire, as if she’s pleading with us to listen. if you were to catch a live show, i imagine the effect would be quite like this record sounds. the band’s take on post-punk isn’t super polished, like a lot of other contemporary bands. but it doesn’t get much closer to perfection than the one-two punch of the upbeat “tender fixation” followed by the mellow “vision talk,” an earlier version of which was teased as a single last year. the former glitters with guitar harmonics, surfy riffs, and filtered, karen o.-style yelps. it’s infectious. luman brings us low, with spoken utterances that sound as if they’re delivered through an overhead speaker, and then high, with prolonged howls that rise above the instrumentation. the latter is quietly lush, with layers of bright keys, guitar, and bass that complicate luman’s pained vocals. crime of passing shares members with and , two other vibrant, eclectic cincinnati outfits—and there is definitely sonic overlap here. each band dabbles in the hypnotic electronic rhythms of krautrock, with a clear interest in complex elements of sound. it’s clear that the city is emerging as a fount of a certain type of dynamic punk, with crime of passing and their cohort leading the pack."
d7051,"dreams drenched in static cremation lily metal zen zsigo has been recording music as for a little over a decade now, but listen to in the broader context of his back catalog, and it’s clear he’s still in the process of shaping and refining the project’s vision. early cremation lily releases—many of which saw the light through zsigo’s cassette label —explored a particularly vulnerable and anguished take on noise and power electronics. noise remains a component of the cremation lily sound, but more recently it’s been joined by new inputs: the warm currents of ambient music, the textural investigations of field recording and—perhaps most surprisingly—the romantic introspection of emotional hardcore. on paper, these genres are strange bedfellows, but —zsigo’s first release for san francisco avant-metal label —hangs together as well as it does because fundamentally, cremation lily is an act of intensely personal expression. throughout his recording career, zsigo has sprinkled his work with allusions to traumas past and present: an unhappy childhood characterized by neglect and abuse, and a near-death experience in the sea near his home along the south coast of england. cremation lily’s music often seems to be concerned with healing. but it makes sense that it often sounds violent, purgative. the music here can be pretty, can be harsh, and can often be both at the same time. take “wavering blood,” on which zsigo’s crooned vocal is all but obliterated by crashing waves of shoegaze guitar, the insistent tick of trap percussion, and an occasional blowtorch blast of distortion. but has the quality of sonic collage; it ebbs and flows, makes unexpected leaps and takes unexpected turns. songs erupt out of pools of ambience; spoken word segments are slowed to a crawl, as if played through a walkman with fading batteries. on “overflowing velvet,” cello and acoustic guitar join together in a mournfully beautiful melody before slowly receding before a harsh wall of feedback. isn’t entirely without outside reference points. the album’s more realized songs—“selfless,” “i need to stop blaming myself”—feel of a piece with the emo/cloud rap fusions of one of zsigo’s sometime collaborators, . its blend of poetic introspection and harsh noise brings to mind an album like prurient’s . but primarily, succeeds because it feels like a work of unflinching honesty; its collision of genres, its fractured songs, an attempt at working through a tangle of thoughts and feelings that are almost too heavy to shoulder."
d7052,"everything perfect is already here claire rousay experimental there’s a moment amidst the ephemeral beauty of the title track to ’s new album, , that i can’t get out of my head. after vaporous passages of processed chamber music and a flourish of chirpy electronics (performed by mari maurice, aka ), we’re left in the hiss of rousay’s open microphones. gradually, a voice begins speaking, but the blur of low-volume recording, background noise, and the speaker’s hushed tone makes it hard to tell if they’re saying they “love,” “left,” or “lost,” someone. each word speaks to a sense of impermanence and unknowing that rousay, leading a band of friends and frequent collaborators, captures throughout what may be her finest album yet. one of the great things about rousay’s music is that she never lets you get too lost in it. the austin-based musician has created some of the best ambient music being made today, but her work is just as likely to jar you with a sudden windswept microphone or murmur of conversation, a joke, or a song. it is music that pushes back at you, reaching out with sounds and words. “a kind of promise” ended last year’s with a tender piano and cello duet, complemented by blurts of sped-up tape noise. each of the players on bring an immense intimacy to the proceedings. early in the sprawling first track “it feels foolish to care,” marilu donovon of plays harp alongside a soft clatter of timbres and voices, while pianist provides a profoundly emotional close that feels like listening in on a rehearsal. yet rather than these pieces feeling like a glimpse into some imagined space, rousay’s careful treatment of sound and editing is only heightened when played inside a real one. her close-mic’d textures—gentle sensations you nonetheless brace for—grow even more effective when they can fill a room, imparting themselves in the moment with each passage of beauty, disruption or weight. just as the small sounds of gradually feel vast, so too does its emotional scope. it’s an album that brings so much in both moments of sadness and joy. it’s quiet; play it loud."
d7053,"wema wema world towards the end of the first pandemic summer, one that featured some of the biggest mass social-justice protests in a generation, the upstate new york-based electronic producer (evan shorstein) released by the london’s afro-latin dance band penya. at the time, the song’s lyrical refrain,“are you doing it for the people, or are you trying to just hide away,” coupled with the natural blend of photay and penya’s complementary sensibilities felt anthemic. “people” demanded that artists and listeners not just align with the right side of history, but choose how to live through it, consciously leaping into the meaning of a moment that was at once specific and open-ended. wema—the remote-recording pandemic collective that reunites photay with members of (producer “magnus p.i.” mehta, vocalist/multi-instrumentalist lilli elina, percussionist jimmy le messurier), as well as , musical scion of tanzania’s first family of gogo music—is a natural continuation of that desire, expanding global connectivity through rhythm and folkways. the hippie intentions of the group’s name—swahili for kindness and benevolence—ring out in lyrics that endorse a sensible, spiritually reflective existence. but it’s the tension between wema’s words and musical choices (polyglot instrumental pairings, thick beat layers of drums and machines, psychedelic post-production crevices) that push beyond mere platitudes. this music is a positivist rage against the modern-world machine, powered by the force of trance-like improvised rituals, as practiced in different parts of the world. most of ’s tracks are two-parters—part 1’s primarily sung in swahili by zawose, and part 2’s primarily by elina in spanish—though they’re less like the flip-sides of old r&b singles or jamaican versions than two different spins on a single idea, or a beat. next to one another, they present cohesive juxtapositions of humanity as a cultural kaleidoscope. “luanje” is one great example. on part 1, zawose is in call-and-response mode: his deeply processed vocal trying to shake off generational trauma, surrounded by wood-block and shakers, electronic bass-plus-kick-drum gyrations that hold forth their own staccato conversation, and sampled voices bending beyond comprehension. halfway through this chaos, a kora appears alongside elina singing about taking refuge in the shadow of a ceiba tree. when zawose returns, the previous elements have coalesced in a rolling mid-tempo afrobeat techno atmosphere, with magnus’ organ recalling fela’s egypt 70. part 2 picks up from elina’s short appearance: leading with the kora, interweaving guitar and organ lines, lightly toasted percussion, and ominous sound effects, all taken at a fraction of its predecessor’s pace and intensity. elina’s song is about the generational reverberations of an aging tree, taking the form of a naturalist sunrise salutation; and it’s not hard to see the relationship between the two parts. “msafiri jam” is even better. “pt. 1” sets up a high-speed acoustic african-dance atmosphere (a bolafon that sounds like it’s on sun ra’s cosmic trip, various hand-drums, a break-neck hi-hat), before synthesizers start sneaking into the mix, in and around zawose’s big group call–and-response; yet the longer its glorious chaos continues, the more modernity’s ghost voices make their presence felt. “pt.2” keeps the tempo, but leads with the type of kick-drum sound whose influence has escaped berlin for dar es salaam. the bolafon now sounds entirely synthetic, elina’s incantation is in the service of pure dance exultation, and when cuban trumpeter yelfris valdes shows up to lead a horn-line, the energy transforms into something that could emanate from ceremonial good times on either side of the caribbean island of hispaniola. listening to such intricate musical mutations, charting their rhythmic routes, is another way of asking what kind of life we want for ourselves, and for the world. there is something magnanimously obvious and direct in wema’s answer. but maybe that’s the best way to make listeners consider it as a true option.

d7058,"fisca blanche blanche blanche experimental, experimental rock the experimental project —the duo of vocalist sarah smith and multi-instrumentalist zach phillips—first surfaced in 2011 with hyperactive synth-pop as fuzzy as a decayed vhs tape and a tireless enthusiasm that fueled nine albums in just a few years. while early releases like 2012’s felt of a piece with the hypnagogic pop trend of the moment, the group’s true strengths—the playful and beautifully emotive vocals behind smith’s deceptive monotone and phillips’s increasingly complex arrangements and dynamic band-leading—have only grown richer over time. that’s never felt more clear than on , an album that reinterprets gems throughout the triple blanche songbook alongside some longtime collaborators. it’s at once the most alive these songs have ever sounded while making a case for the brilliant songwriters phillips and smith have always been. while the 13 songs here are mostly drawn from blanche blanche blanche’s original run of releases between 2011 to 2014 (the fantastic “return of the simple child” appeared on last year’s comeback album and sounds completely transformed), never feels focused on the past. instead, the album folds seamlessly in with phillips’s recent label , a series of releases building on his collaborative “open session rock” approach that began with 2021’s lovely chanteuse-influenced from fievel is glauque . players from those projects and earlier iterations of blanche blanche blanche join and, together, the group find distinct ways to revisit each song. sometimes these are sonic improvements like “in the ring,” which cuts the distorted news interview playing in the original to wonderfully emphasize the sense of space and atmosphere. other changes are more subtle, like opener “alots b4” which passes some of the original’s synthesizer stabs to billy mcshane’s alto sax, or the band’s 2011 debut single “talk out loud” which gains a new momentum through drummer jo miller-gamble’s rushing snare. but more than any individual shift, it’s the fluid sense of conversation between band members that shines through every song. while listening to , i got the idea to rebuild the tracklist using the original versions of songs. initially, i thought i’d compare which versions were “better,” but terms like that seem so far removed from phillips and smith’s entire approach to making or thinking about music. instead, i was left with a greater appreciation for these songs on a skeletal level across every era of this wonderful, underrated band; the melodic flourishes, whether they’re played by a tight jazz-fusion outfit or blasted out of an old casio, and the assuredness with which smith cuts through the whole spectrum with both funny and heartswelling hooks at every turn. it feels like an introduction regardless of your familiarity, with each song crafting its own path to further appreciation. don’t call it a “best of”— that would require looking backwards and shows blanche blanche blanche will never stop charging confidently ahead."

d7065,"v4 visions: of love & androids various artists r&b/soul in the early ‘90s the uk’s pirate radio network was flooding the airwaves of london with small-batch bedroom recordings on artist-run indie labels that specialized in street soul, deep house, swingbeat, and jungle. one of those labels was whose brief lifespan ended when they began shifting away from the homegrown sounds that had been influences on the label—jazz funk, brit funk, and lover’s rock—in an attempt to compete with the new jack swing that was dominating the billboard charts in the united states. numero group’s new retrospective compilation scrambles that timeline with its non-linear sequencing, resulting in a collection that celebrates the label’s legacy in offering r&b and house with a positive message. it was an 18-year-old from south london named julie stapleton who first got v4 vision blasting on the pirate airwaves with “just dreaming” in 1991. stapleton’s hit rides a mid-tempo beat that draws on lover’s rock and has a synth line in the opening seconds that’s such an earworm, you’ll find yourself looking forward to its return. stapleton’s single was not about head-in-the-clouds euphoria—it was an extension of martin luther king jr.’s . it was also a b-side; v4 visions was hoping to capture listeners with the hypnotic deep house of “where’s your love gone”—which later found success as a cover by kylie minogue on her 1994 self-titled album, earning stapleton a certified gold plaque. (by contrast, singles from v4 visions maxed out at 500 copies.) endangered species’s convergence of uk’s soul jazz and new york garage house caught the attention of legendary u.s. dance label strictly rhythm, who licensed singles from both endangered species and fellow v4 visions artist ashaye, earning the label international hits. one of the label’s last singles, “joy in the jungle” by jungle biznizz, is a direct nod to the emerging jungle scene; v4 visions would cease operations just as jungle and drum & bass began to dominate the dance clubs. it didn’t help that the label was also up against the notorious government crackdowns on dance music, under accusations that nightclubs were hedonistic drug havens corrupting the british youth. ironically, v4 visions’s soulful house and street soul was rooted in socio-political messages that defied the mischaracterizations of the music. “just dreaming” gave the label an audience beyond the dance floor, but in its later years, the label attempted to capitalize on the new jack swing fad—a decision the founders have said that, in hindsight, they regret. street soul indies like v4 visions rarely found mainstream chart success, but their legacies resonate to this day in artists like , fka twigs, and erykah badu, who take cues from the era’s indelible experimental moments."

(henderson gives interviews in a decidedly british accent, so it’s never been entirely clear whether her vaguely germanic singing voice is an affect or a natural outgrowth of her german heritage and her many years spent living in berlin.) as for the rest of the album, there are plenty of hits to offset the minor misses. unusually, the middle third of the album is its strongest segment: the vocal acrobatics and propulsive rhythm section of “naysayer” give way to an absolutely massive, droning synth on “sand witches,” underscoring monotone spoken word poetics à la . then, on “never coming back”—the album’s catchiest track—that same synth is scaled back over traditional pop instrumentation while anika sings about a lover she took for granted. later, the kim gordon-channeling “rights” dissolves into the synth-pop anthem “freedom,” both of which avoid the direct political messaging their names belie. “waiting for something,” a slow-burning track with an acoustic feel, would fit more comfortably on an record than an anika album, but it closes the latest chapter in henderson’s unorthodox musical journey with a graceful flourish nonetheless."

(plans to film live performances in celebration of the reissue actually had to be rescheduled due to the chaos at the capitol building.) despite employing a host of unconventional instruments, there’s a bare quality to the songs—like trees exposed to an endless winter. the album was engineered by christina files (swirlies, ) in a large old building that used to be a factory, and that big, open space contributes to the record’s sense of barrenness. (the album’s intentionally out-of-tune piano, for example, was recorded in an empty elevator shaft.) timony outlines her ambitions for the album in opening song “dungeon dance,” its lyrics detailing the experience of depression and the search for meaning from experience through art. in a way, it recalls virginia woolf, whose 1927 novel is ultimately about its own creation—the author’s “attempt at something.” like woolf, timony writes nakedly about her self-destructive tendencies: on “painted horses” she wishes the song would kill her, then confesses she would like to kill herself peacefully in “valley of 1,000 perfumes.” but even amidst the blackness of despair, timony still seeks out the glow of creation, ultimately deciding that we must not “give [ourselves] away/ there are too many others in pain.” if has a single unifying theme, it’s that we must stay alive for one another, and that we must the meaning and connection we want from life. not that creation is easy. in “the hour glass,” timony wrestles with the struggle of working odd jobs while trying to survive as a touring musician. “this is the knife of life, work, and independence/ we are only free at night, but that is when we sleep.” the reissue is rounded out by new versions of four songs, which offer fresh shading and nuance. a new version of “return to pirates” reinforces the sense that timony is moving towards victory over despair, singing, “i want to be in the garden of love/ led by a lamb and a little white dove.” an orchestral version of “valley of 1,000 perfumes” is lush with string arrangements, and timony’s voice is even more audible here when she insists, “today our music doesn’t have enough style/ we’re going to run to the country from a suicide.” that line is a reminder of timony’s prescience at the turn of the century as she sought out new ways to render both music life meaningful again. when it was first released in 2000, was either largely overlooked or actively derided by critics. now, 20 years later, its influence can be traced in the many albums that followed (sleater-kinney’s psych-prog excursion feels like it was directly inspired by timony’s aesthetic sensibilities.) the album remains incredible and timeless: a place we can always return to that shows us how to survive the darkness, riding glimmers of light into the creation of new realities."

d7235,"total freedom kathleen edwards pop longtime fans of kathleen edwards can appreciate the dark humor in the fact that the canadian country songwriter decided to stage a comeback the same year the whole world shut down indefinitely. her entire career—to say nothing of the characters in her songs—has been characterized by this kind of bum luck. the one-two punch of her stunning 2002 debut and its 2004 follow-up announced edwards as someone who could write about people shoved to society’s margins with both compassion and precision. “six o’clock news,” s opening track, told the story of a standoff between the police and a man holed up with a gun in a second story apartment with such detail you could practically smell the sweat and gunpowder. when she wrote about herself, that fatalism took on a wry, self-effacing edge; “write a hit so i can talk you up,” she once sang to a mythical rock star boyfriend, “no one likes a girl who won’t sober up.” the knowing title of that track is edwards’ career in a nutshell: “one more song the radio won’t like.” she kept that combination of caustic wit, narrative acuity, and scalding gallows humor going through three records, each as strong as the last, each ultimately just clearing the brush for similarly minded artists like miranda lambert and ashley monroe to storm through. each new edwards lp met with the same commercial indifference. so, like any sensible artist, she changed tactics: in 2011 she released , which was produced by then-boyfriend justin vernon and which traded barbed humor and cutting country riffs for soft-focus pop songs that focused more explicitly on matters of the heart. the public shrugged, and the album came and went; seven years later, another country songwriter pulled the exact same maneuver, except this time the album was called and it ended up in the upper regions of most of the year’s top 10 lists and scored an album of the year grammy. for die-hard edwards fans, it was hard to feel like there was some kind of perverse cosmic conspiracy keeping one of the world’s greatest songwriters sidelined. and so when she finally ditched the whole bag in 2014 to open a coffee shop in her hometown of ottawa—hilariously named “quitters”—who could blame her? in an , she said she couldn’t imagine returning to music. now, five years after that interview, she has, and her comeback album contains some of her most inward-looking work to date; its muted, watercolor pop sound feels perfectly designed for long days spent indoors. on , edwards takes stock of her life, presenting her findings with sensitivity and, occasionally, self-deprecation. the tone is set from the get-go with “glenfern,” a genuinely sweet thank-you note from edwards to her ex-husband and former bandmate colin cripps that expresses gratitude for the years they spent together while also getting in a few jabs at the music industry: “now when i find myself looking back, i think of all the cool shit that happened,” edwards sings, “like, we had a tour bus with a bed in the back/ we bought a rock and roll dream—and it was total crap.” on “simple math,” a tender ode to lifelong friendship, she marks the passage of time in generations: “building forts in cedar trees/ ice cream, banana seats/ everything and nothing changes/ and now we are our mothers’ age.” “who rescued who” is a big-hearted love song to edwards’ rescue dog, and on “options open,” over a gleaming slide-guitar hook, edwards smirks at her own persistent singlehood (“for 39 years, i’ve been keeping my options open”). flashes of the old edwards cutting wit turn up—particularly on “fool’s ride,” where she thoroughly dismantles a terrible ex-boyfriend (the umpteenth warning sign becomes, “a red flag flying in a shit parade”). but overall, the edwards on is more reflective; the instruments are treated so that they become bands of sound that stretch softly across the backdrop of the songs, making for music that is more textural than the gravel-road americana of her early work. the quietly crushing “ashes to ashes” is just a few whispers of acoustic guitar and cottony atmospherics; “hard on everyone” adopts a war on drugs-y chug, the guitars as liquid and shapeless as rain on a windowpane. what comes through more than anything on is the sound of contentment. there was a kind of urgency to edwards’ early work that’s common to an artist who’s trying to claw their way into view. on , defeat and bitterness has given way to wonder and wisdom. it is a record made to be attentively played, thoughtfully absorbed, and quietly considered. in that way, edwards—at long last—is right on time."

(a refrain that the black panther party would employ at actions back in the day), the song gives way to somber piano and a spoken word section that details the beauty, joy, and resistance inherent in being black in a world inundated with anti-blackness: “black is safety, black is benevolence, black is a lifeboat after an sos…and when everything else fails, black endures” the album kicks into full gear with “stop dem,” a midtempo head-nodder with thick, slapping drums and a heavy bassline. the track’s layered gang vocals also take on the form of a chant, full of fire and indignation: “even though we know that you fear us, that ain’t no reason to kill us.” “wildfires” uses a dreamy, echoing groove as the backdrop for a searing indictment of the police’s long campaign of terror against the black community. “you should be ashamed/ the bloodshed on your hands,” a vocalist sings, “take off your badge/ we all know it was murder/ murder, murder/ murder.” on “bow,” which features a guest appearance by michael kiwanuka, sault’s mission to protect and affirm black life is taken to its most logical, pan-diasporic conclusion. over a bubbling, afro-beat groove, kiwanuka delivers an anthem celebrating the kinship and solidarity of black people everywhere: “answer to kenya/ check in with uganda/ remember rwanda/ i see tanzania/ from verde to ghana/ take care of somalia/ free sudan/ blood thicker than water.” it goes without saying that the album’s themes are timely; but another aspect of its power is the way feels connected to the centuries of black art that came before it. as baraka reminded us back in ‘65, black art and creativity must be used as a weapon of resistance. the songs on sometimes serve as affirmations, asserting our own inalienable beauty and power; other times they appear in the form of protest, giving voice to our outrage and pain while serving as a vehicle for us to envision a new and better world."

d7246,"weight of the world mike hip-hop/rap in a way, it’s surprising that it’s taken the new york rapper mike this long to name an album . ever since his 2017 breakthrough the chief trait that has come to define his music is his willingness to keep his emotions close to the surface. 2019’s career-best was a raw and moving rumination on the death of his mother, and albums like 2018’s were unsparing catalogs of insecurity and self doubt. but on , his struggles are external: “i was hurtin’, savin’ n—s who wouldn’t do the same,” he raps on “no no” over a bleary soul loop, “i gave my purpose out to n—s who was choosin’ fame.” betrayal is the running theme on its songs are dotted with references to double-crossers and manipulative friends, “serpents,” and “leeches in your circle.” the tone isn’t accusatory, it’s wounded; on “coat of many colors”—the title of which is a reference the biblical story in which joseph is betrayed by his brothers—mike raps, “i offer n—s my advice, and they just see a fortune/ try to lean me for it, these n—s be informants” while a sanded-down, smoked-up lounge loop spins lazily in the background, like a tonearm stuck in a locked groove. “where was you when i sat in the rain?” he asks late in the album, “is you stupid, or lacking a brain?” the imagery feels deliberate—he may lash out in the back half of the verse, but the first half is a heartbreaking depiction of abandonment. mike has always favored production that was woozy and blown out, but on , it’s even more diffuse than usual, at times approaching the slowed-down hypnagogia of vaporwave. the backdrop to “more gifts” consists of little more than a soul song snipped short and set to half speed, and “plans” is all treble-heavy, empty-mall expansiveness. it’s not lazy, just efficient; the heavily saturated sounds suit the album’s somber subject matter, and the producers—primarily dj blackpower and keiyaa—save the pyrotechnics for specific, calculated moments. on the title track, the beat shapeshifts three times in conjunction with the narrative: first it’s chipmunk soul; then, 90 seconds in, it abruptly shifts to call center hold music; then it shifts a third time into a rubbery, re-worked latin soft pop ballad. keiyaa turns “222” into a production showcase, giddily skipping keys and bass across a rippling ocean of synths. and on the album-closing “allstar,” which features an appearance by earl sweatshirt, dj blackpower pushes the beat deep into the background to forefront the mcs. the song doesn’t offer any closure on the album’s dominant theme; mike is too honest for that kind of moralizing, and also that’s not really the point. the point is instead summarized in mike’s final verse: “poke a hole into my chest, watch it bleed violet.” isn’t about healing, it’s about bloodletting. these 16 songs are the sound of grief in progress."

(the release’s timing is sadly appropriate on that front.) if anything, this is a left field showcase, right from the start—the mix’s opening roundelay is mostly newer tracks with a freewheeling sense of auditory trickery, from iona fortune’s springy ambient to sudan archives’ plucked-string meditation. another highlight, archie pelago’s “brown oxford,” reconfigures a walking stand-up bass and smeared brass as the basis of a trick-heavy house track that disguises its deeply psychedelic properties with a straight face. remember the old term, “home listening album”? that’s what mr. scruff has made here."

d7282,"the experience of repetition as death clarice jensen experimental the music of cellist and composer is so immersive, it’s easy to just get lost in it. her patient “cello constellations”—as one early track title describes them—float on waves of bowed strings. but jensen’s work has a lot of other levels too, be they intellectual, thematic, or emotional. that’s more true than ever on her latest release, the title of which reflects the record’s the deep conceptual underpinnings. here, jensen doesn’t just use recurring motifs, she grapples with the fundamental cycle of mortality. the word “death” in the album title is not just a metaphor. jensen wrote much of this album when her mother was dying of leukemia—a time filled with the repetition of errands, doctor visits, and the omnipresent bleats of hospital equipment. the latter influenced the hypnotic “metastable,” in which jensen’s cello swings gently between high and low pitches, slowly building intensity yet never wavering from its steady pulse. that intensity ratchets up in the drama of the next track, “holy mother.” though the title of this massive piece is taken from the tibetan name for the similarly-massive mount everest, it’s hard not to also hear in the track’s organ-like tones an elegy to jensen’s own parents. such layered themes are strengthened by the way jensen returns to specific musical figures throughout , especially in the album’s circular beginning and end. opener “daily” uses a simple chord progression that continually rises, and closer “final” reiterates the phrase from tape loops that jensen created in the studio—but only after she deliberately degraded them by crumpling and even stepping on them. the track’s murky feel slowly fades to reveal a pure, majestic version of jensen’s theme. by ending where she began, jensen offers both resolution and hope, suggesting that if death is bound to repeat, so too is life."

d7299,"wildfire covers hand habits and friends alternative california is burning. when meg duffy, the l.a.-based musician who records as hand habits, was writing songs for their sophomore album , record-breaking wildfires were ripping across the state—the mendocino complex, woolsey, and camp fires of 2018 were the deadliest and most destructive in california’s history. “i remember walking around with a cup of coffee and seeing ashes fall into my coffee,” they told . “i had never been so aware of the environment.” thanks to climate change, california’s fire season is now year-round, a “new normal” that, as david wallace-wells writes in , is a kind of illusion; it is “the end of normal; never normal again.” in a note for the ep, duffy writes that, between gas-guzzling vans, intercontinental airplane rides, and end-of-night solo cup clean-up, being a touring musician is “often not the most environmentally conscious career.” in search of some helping hands, duffy enlisted fellow musicians like angel olsen and tara jane o’neil to put their own spins on the title track and has partnered with bandcamp and saddle creek, with all proceeds from the ep going to the amazon conservation organization. hand habits’ original track is a piece of simmering americana. duffy’s singing—“california / only one who knows / how to burn without desire”—is enveloped in the heat-haze of brad cook’s production. the track’s basic elements, from the dirge-like pacing to the isolated and lonely voice, remain on every cover, but are transformed with jaunty lounge piano flair on one track and overwhelming digital distortion on another. angel olsen isolates a rear-view sadness with just her voice and pedaled piano chords, while kacey johansing channels the song’s romantic notes into dreamy ’60s country. there is something clarifying in hearing the same themes inhabited by so many different voices, lending a certain particularity to duffy’s purposefully-vague lyrics. but no matter the dressing, the song’s drama remains the same, and no matter how many times the singer refuses to tell us “where it all ends up,” their end feels pre-determined: in “wildfire / wildfire.”"

(the chorus of “hour of the furnaces”—“we all step into the fire”—makes for a thrilling, unnerving high point.) drummer matt tong delivers an exquisite combination of analog and digital rhythms, while fisher, ryan mahan, and lee tesche flesh out the arrangements using sharp bursts of guitar and thick bass. the end result are anthems like the ever more tightly winding “chaka”—which includes one hell of a sax break—and the slow-burner “dispossession,” which is punctuated by occasional breaks from fisher. meanwhile songs like the piano-centered poison ballad “losing is ours” and the high stakes “nothing bloomed” serve as both a reminder of—and a riposte to—the ever-growing sense of ominousness that has become a characteristic of our time.

d7307,"scis” and “eksploio oval electronic the music markus popp makes as is in part about the act of listening. his tracks—“experimental” to be sure, but otherwise difficult to classify in terms of genre—are defined by how they focus attention, zooming in to assess the most minute detail of a sample one moment and zooming out to showcase the latticework construction of the whole the next. popp forces the listener to think about how they process sonic information, but his work also happens to be inviting no matter what intellectual engagement one brings to it. the two newest oval releases, the ep and the album , are the product of the ideas that have defined the project all along, but popp continues to add new wrinkles. to understand how we got here, it helps to take a step back. oval’s recorded output can be divided into several distinct phases. the project’s earliest work was decidedly ambient but with a discomfiting edge, as soothing hums and digital clicks and buzzes interrupted drones. starting around the time of 1999’s ep, popp added noise and distortion, and the music became aggressive and overwhelming while keeping elements of conventional melodic beauty. after a long break from oval in the 2000’s, popp returned in 2010 with , which found him inhabiting a world of clean tones that referenced recognizable instruments—even as his compositional structures remained wild and unpredictable. and are part of a more recent phase that finds oval in a dreamier realm; popp builds pieces from small fragments that he arranges for maximum emotional engagement, creating a kind of kaleidoscope of color in sound. has an almost classical bearing, with bits of piano and orchestral sounds that lend drama. one can sense the hand of a composer; the random element, always present with oval, sits more in the background. “eksploio” has string-like synth parts, reminiscent of ‘90s chill rooms, and a rush of low-end energy that is recognizably percussive. it’s unusually musical for oval. “blissous” has a chattering series of taps sourced from the highest few keys on the piano, giving the twitchy and beat-heavy electronics a wooden earthiness. and “brockaat” is among the most tuneful tracks popp has created, with a simple two-note melodic refrain anchoring the piece and foregrounding glimmering trills of xylophone. if is disarmingly pretty, ’s defining characteristics are rhythm and noise. that push and pull of opposing forces, where the most delicate bits of melody—a sampled guitar, a shard of piano, a small fragment of voice—compete for space with a deep bass rumble that’s hard to pry apart, is the essence of the album. the opening “twirror” is packed with distorted drones and squeaks that function almost like power chords, while a heavy quake of electronic percussion adds tension underneath. “pushhh” features a chaotic series of drum hits driving the beat under noisy synths, but also has a traditional backbeat, something of a rarity in the oval world; “robussy” is another track with a hypnotically throbbing bottom octave. beats are often out front on , but popp’s drum programming isn’t tied to any particular musical idiom. though the music is tethered to a steady pulse, percussion, for popp, is ultimately another tool for density and space. if this pair of records is an early glimpse at the next phase of oval’s sound, it’s one with a lot of promise, as both channel his complicated methods into music of rare emotional force."

d7313,"musica infinita tino contreras jazz, latin jazz for much of his 60-year career, jazz drummer tino contreras has stood just outside the spotlight both in his native mexico and abroad, largely because his music has been tough to pin down. born in ciudad juarez, chihuahua in 1924, his professional career didn’t begin until the early 1950’s—first as part of luis alcaraz’s latin swing orchestra, then with pianist juan garcía esquivel. in 1953, contreras released his first solo album, , a self-described tropical jazz lp reportedly inspired by a trip he’d taken to the dominican republic. in an era of bebop and big band, his sound was more psychedelic, a forward-looking mix of swing, waltz, and american avant-garde. take a song like “ ,” for instance: with its slight drum taps, bleak organ chords, and brooding choral chants, the track feels funereal—like a portent of approaching doom, or the rising noise from scorched earth. then there’s 1960’s “ ” with its pitch-black piano loop and extended drum solo predating henry mancini’s “pink panther theme” or marvin gaye’s “trouble man.” in 1978, working with musical partner estrella newman under the group name quinto sol (spanish for “fifth sun”), contreras released one of his boldest albums. the project—heavily influenced by the aztec calendar—is based around the idea of the , an object said to document the earth’s transformation. the music here is equally probing, steeped in the sound of experimental jazz from colombia and mexico. but there are also hints of funk and new york-centric free jazz, which gives the music a strange yet familiar quality—like -era miles davis soundtracking a stoner film. the album is being re-released on the newly-created by cratedigger, dj, and label owner gilles peterson, who first bought the record years ago in japan. some time later in mexico, he was introduced to a fellow record collector named carlos icaza, who introduced him to contreras. together the three formalized a plan to reissue . on the 10-minute opener “sinfonia del quinto sol,” the musicians blend ghostly strings, looping wind instruments, and operatic wails into a volatile arrangement that never quite stabilizes. the album’s other tracks, “el hombre cosmico” and “orbita,” sound nearly identical in tempo and tone, until the latter briefly breaks down and the haunting harp chords from “sinfonia del quinto sol” return, bringing this quick ep (three tracks, twenty-one minutes) full circle. forty-two years after its initial release, is still just as challenging, a beguiling piece of art poised to get the credit it deserved all that time ago."

d7325,"dark thoughts the shivas here’s a dark thought: if there is a genius in being aware of your own limitations, then the only reason garage rock isn’t full of geniuses is because the bands stop being garage once they start attempting to do anything intellectual with a genre that’s raw power springs from its “anyone can do it” anti-elitism. witness the number of early 2010s garage bands now putting out double lps of thinky prog or synth-punk. portland band the shivas land solidly on the “punk” side of the garage spectrum on fifth lp , where the band settle in for a solid set of righteous three-chord wonders delivered with a mean streak that will always be to the tastes of a certain doomy subset of ‘60s rock fans. there’s a ritualistic quality to the way the band whips themselves into a spectral sonic frenzy on every track, regardless of tone or tempo. though the shivas are here for the party, there are no sunshine sounds to be found, even when the band is proclaiming the joys of listening to the radio (“playing on the radio”) with lots of “ba ba ba’s” in the chorus for everyone to sing along with. they also leave little room for bad vibes or fresh air while barreling through the many colorful moving parts of the blaringly wet and blown-out rave up “feels surreal.” but is distinguished exactly by being 99% squall. “lush” wouldn’t be a terrible word for the atmosphere the group conjures, if it weren’t for all the clanging guitars, layered, howling vocals and pounding drums that give the whole thing a cranked-up, ceremonial feel—the kind that asks full buy-in from listeners in return for a full dose. yet the shivas’ ability to corral such cacophony into songs full of propulsive groove and melodic throttle is their greatest strength as a unit, and they do so with obvious delight on the clamorous, catchy and discomfiting “can’t relax.“ another highlight is drummer kristin leonard’s delivery of the drippy doo-wop torch ballad “if you see me.” she’s got the pipes for the kind of unabashedly dramatic showing the song requires, and her warbling, sunken vocals creep slowly up to a dramatic belt that’s thrilling in its open-hearted intensity. for all its affected arcane gloom, however, isn’t especially mysterious—though it does keep one foot in the grave at all times. the shivas have delivered a banging and old-fashioned good time in a slightly nightmarish sonic playground, rendered vividly enough to show that coloring within the lines can be a kind of art all of its own."

( guitarist ben greenberg cut the album’s five corrosive pieces straight to tape in the studio, keeping a set list of sorts in mind for side a and b.) deepening the album’s darkness is the fact that it’s a concept record about self-cannibalism—the ways in which we ravage both ourselves and the world around us. or as chardiet puts it in a potent artist statement, “to be well adjusted in this system is to be oblivious and unfeeling. this is for the rest of us, who understand that chaos, madness, pain and even self-destruction are natural and inevitable responses to an unjust and disgusting world of our own making.” also documents the ways that empathy—a recurring theme in pharmakon’s bleak, yet deeply human, catalog—gives way to grief. each track on mirrors a different stage of mourning: denial (the churning “homeostasis”), anger (“spit it out,” with its throbbing bass and chainsaw-like feedback), bargaining (the turbine-engine chug of “self-regulating system”), depression (“deprivation,” harrowing in its severity), and acceptance (the scabrous “pristine panic / cheek by jowl”). this mercurial approach makes for an engaging listen even when chardiet’s mangled industrial melodies and steam-pressed beats are on full blast, sending high-pitched squeals and waves of static crashing in all directions. both a cry for help and a call to arms, it’s like being stuck, frantic, on a sinking ship with no shore in sight. but surrender is not the album’s message; if anything, it feels like an angry rebuke to the notion of “keep calm and carry on.” that passivity, suggests, is deadly. the end is nigh, and there’s so much noise yet to be made."

d7342,"of the sun trupa trupa alternative, indie rock the reputation of the gdansk, poland-based band trupa trupa has been growing steadily over the last few years. the group, led by gregarious singer and guitarist grzegorz kwiatkowski, has gone from self-releasing albums at the start of the decade to signing to indie label lovitt in the u.s. (glitterbeat in the eu) as the ‘10s draw to a close. draws on wider strands of what could be broadly called “21st century post-rock”—big rhythms courtesy of drummer tomasz pawluczuk, a bleak sense of atmosphere that borders on goth, and rafał wojczal’s occasional keyboards to add extra heft. kwiatkowski sings in english throughout, moving from smooth, even uplifting turns on songs like “longing” to sharper spoken word bits that occasionally call to mind mark e. smith. there’s a dark, murky undercurrent running throughout the record; you can hear it in wojciech juchniewicz’s murmuring underwater bass break on the queasily pulsing “mangle,” in the tense guitars in the roiling thunderstorm that is “remainder,” and in the abstract, devo-esque herky-jerk of “turn.” there’s a sense of unsettled disorientation that comes through at other points, too, whether it’s the swooping background textures on “another day” or the distant backing vocals that drift through “long time ago” while the band makes more nervous, raucous noise. even the quieter moments like “angle” or the semi-ambling lope of “anyhow” seem like they’re sitting in the shadows of something menacing and indescribable. the epic punch of trupa trupa’s songs feels like it has a grimmer edge, one that betrays a sense that things may not be as you want them to be. all too apt for the current times."

(he’s collaborated on multiple occasions with mc guanaco of reggae-hip-hop collective sudakaya, whose oeuvre incorporates “criollismo,” or working class folklorism, in the makeup of his flow.) on , kingman employs rap productions featuring notes of traditional music to consider humankind’s relationship to the universe; his bars nod, perhaps, to the african griot tradition, subtly suggesting hip-hop’s status as modern-day chant. tracks like “religar” deploy delicate percussion that conjures the shuar beats with which kingman previously surrounded himself, dramatically recontextualized in a trap-inspired astral musing. witness the straightforward folk of “último aliento” and the synthetic aria of the lp’s title track for further proof of his reverence for such fusion. by employing this mix of contemporary and ancestral sounds, kingman draws a straight line between the knowledge of ancestors and today’s existential trip."

(it was eventually released on cd in japan in 1991.) the album features one of takayanagi’s most fearless groups, the new direction unit, and the music it contains is unapologetically fierce and monumental. the b-side, “my friend, blood shaking my heart,” is one long dose of the kind of medicine that might kill you before it makes you better—a screaming, squalling fire storm of sound that races across the earth and lays waste to everything in its path. which is not to say the album is without moments of beauty; kengi mori’s bass clarinet on “what have we given?” sits above nobuyoshi ino’s bass and the thrashing, trashy cymbals of hiroshi yamazaki’s percussion arsenal. on opening track “we have existed,” mori’s flute takes determined leaps over ino’s brisk cello lines, both of which evolve against and into the smoldering flames of takayanagi’s guitar. when someone asked takayanagi about failure to be released as planned, he replied simply “these things happen.” forty-four years after it was created, still sounds fierce and futuristic. one can only wonder what might have happened to music had it been released in the mid ‘70s."

d7384,"epilogue aaron abernathy r&b/soul aaron abernathy’s latest lp, is the last album in a trilogy that began in 2016. the previous installments featured ruminations on love, race, and society through abernathy’s unique twist on modern soul; skews personal, documenting a recent breakup and chronicling the journey to redemption and self-actualization that followed. the album is broken up by snippets of phone conversations about the breakup, using the spoken words to outline the emotional effect while the songs expound on the broader themes. musically, traverses a wide range of styles: “vent of love” employs 808 kicks and the clear influence of trap music, while “i want you again,” with is falsetto vocal line and twinkling piano, recalls the heyday of motown. “wounded hearts club,” with its stuttering rhythms, popping bass and blinking electronics, feels like a distant cousin to ‘80s electro-funk, while the luxurious “revisions” draws on the sound of ‘90s neo-soul. ’s wide stylistic range mirrors the turbulence in the aftermath of a breakup—crushing lows followed by euphoric highs. the different moods give abernathy’s story depth and texture, but the pain of the event is always close to the surface."

d7389,"kokoroko kokoroko jazz in the nigerian dialect urhobo, kokoroko means “be strong,” and the strength of this eight-member london-based band lies in their deft balance of sweeping horns, jittery guitar lines, and jubilant vocals. on their latest ep, the traditions of african musical luminaries like fela kuti and ebo taylor are carried on by their contemporary descendants, on four songs that create rich, colorful worlds of sound, and make a case for afrobeat’s transatlantic connection. throughout the ep, oscar jerome’s graceful guitar leads serve as a complement to sheila maurice-grey’s triumphant horn charts, and the songs swing between slow grooves (“ti-de”) and steady rhythmic shuffle (“uman”). cassie kinoshi and richie take a minimalist approach to vocals, using them mostly to punch up particularly simmering sections of songs like “uman” and “abusey junction.” the band’s music is equally suited to an outdoor party on a late summer’s evening, or the inside of a darkened late-night jazz club; the slow crawl of guitar and steady, percolating rhythms gentle beckon two-steppers to the dancefloor, subtly nodding to the jazz and afrobeat of the past while keeping its eyes fixed on the present."

d7391,"past lives caleb burhans experimental, guitar new york composer and multi-instrumentalist caleb burhans is a man of contrasts. he’s a self-described agnostic with a passion for sacred music (he has a history of singing in church choirs). he’s a composer who creates noncommercial music for his own projects, but has worked with popular comics of late-night tv (including stephen colbert and david letterman). and, as a musician, he’s been known to adapt his talents for any style, performing in orchestras, ambient ensembles, rock bands, and disco groups, among other settings. all of those experiences (sans disco, perhaps) come into play on burhans’s latest album, , a collection of four pieces from his decades-spanning catalog of works thematically centered around grief—not just as a response to death or failed relationships, but also to time, opportunity lost to addiction, and changing eras and identities (he wrote 2010’s “requiem for general motors in janesville, wisconsin” after the auto plant in his hometown ceased production). but where his 2013 album mixes reverent choral vocals with lush orchestral arrangements, is characterized by sparse, profoundly intimate instrumentals that feel more like a private mediation than communal ritual. co-produced with grey mcmurray, burhans’s collaborator in electro-acoustic duo itsnotyouitsme, the record does a lot within that context. opener “a moment for jason molina”—a tribute to the indie songwriter who passed away in 2013—features simon jermyn on guitar and recalls some of the earthy, soul-stirring qualities of molina’s music. “contritus,” performed by new york’s jack quartet, channels a contemplative, cinematic rollercoaster of emotions. after a gentle marimba and harp performance on “once in a blue moon,” burhans closes things out with “early music (for a saturday),” merging stoic bass guitar and minimalist electronic blips into an interplanetary journey that slowly dissolves into the white light of the beyond. in many faiths and traditions, mourning is viewed as an act for the living. likewise, doesn’t just seek to honor departed friends or note a closing chapter of life, but to explore the unanswered questions and complex feelings of the bereaved. though the moods might be sad, burhans always provides plenty of space for reflection. and in times where personal tragedies often play out more publicly on a more massive scale than ever, this album feels like a gift."

(to that reminiscent, respiratory end, laraaji’s iconic laughter drives the lp’s standout track “sunken forest,” its sharpened vocalization samples cutting through dense riddim webs with ease.) though offers a supremely chill experience regardless of format, it’s arguably at its best when experienced as a sustained work: all six sides of its physical three-lp format play en suite, ad infinitum. this mode of listening showcases one of log(m)’s calling cards, the “eternal opuscules”: locked, eternally-looping grooves the duo have tucked into releases since their earliest 12”s. on vinyl, each side ends with errant fragments that completely eliminate the automatic reset of the needle—a framing that casts as a potentially-endless bout of escapism, rather than a mere assemblage of tracks."

(appropriately, keith cameos on “mars attacks.”) against this intoxicating backdrop, blakrok traverses a realm of twisted organic matter where hip-hop’s standard sucker mcs have been replaced by mythological characters. on “picture box,” she goes from communicating with aries through her pineal gland, to threatening she’ll “trigger moonquakes” cast from her spellbook. next, she’s “chasing phantasms” and rescuing sacred stone tablets over the hazy drums and moody bass twangs of “monatomic mushroom.” like all good sci-fi experiences, there’s a dystopian murmur throughout ; it comes to a climax on the poignant, static-crusted closing cut, “land of gray,” where our hero gazes out over scorched lands, raises her scepter, and sagely rues how “man’s awakening is accompanied by grief.” as the song fades into fuzz and reverb, you’ve witnessed the confirmation of a truly individual new rap voice."

(it was fullwood who penned mckay’s 1971 hit “old joe”.) a few years later, fullwood’s journey into rastafarianism would lead him to cross paths with another titan of the genre: ras michael, whose work with the sons of negus turns the deep mystique of dub into ritual music for rasta worship, built around low, bobbing basslines and blissful group chants. so it’s no surprise that fullwood’s sole record with i-mo-jah—the group he formed with winston mckenzie and cassandra jenkins—would reflect both reggae’s soulful and spiritual sides. the record’s credits read like a who’s who of jamaican music: leroy “horsemouth” wallace and sly dunbar provide percussion, robbie shakespeare and aston barrett turn up on bass; and on trumpet, burning spear sideman bobby ellis. the all-star class reflects fullwood’s social circle, but i-mo-jah don’t need the help: is a powerful batch of roots music that was released in 1982 and somehow has never been reissued until the excellent uk label pressure sounds stepped in to right that wrong. what’s most gripping about is the lack of division between the record’s rasta and rocksteady elements; “fools rush in” has the easy groove and pulsing keys of an alton ellis love song, but the object of the song’s affection is divine. jenkins and fullwood’s vocals intertwine beautifully on the refrain, occasionally echoing one another, occasionally harmonizing. “jah love” has the same low, hypnotic groove that ras michael worked with sons of negus, but jenkins darting backing vocals could have been nicked from a ‘60s r&b single. the song is a masterwork of wide-open spaces, occasional bursts of chicken-scratch guitar invading the empty space between the tiptoeing bassline. album closer “weeping and wailing” is a work of wonder: deep, spiritual group vocals punctuating funereal organ stabs and b.b. king-style guitar licks from steve goldstein. out of circulation for far too long, is a work of divine beauty."

d7450,"endless scroll bodega alternative, indie the title of the debut album from nyc-based bodega, pulls off a tricky double meaning, equating internet consumption with long, ancient religious texts. the group return to that theme again and again across the album’s 14 tracks, picking apart our collective obsession with technology. lyricists ben hozie and nikki belfiglio use deliberately mundane and unembellished language to conjure mundane and unembellished characters and settings, and their portrait of the modern age is unpretentious and all too realistic—often hilarious in its scorn and exasperation. the first moment of ’s winkingly-titled second track, “bodega birth,” states the album’s thesis: “i use my computer for everything / heaven knows i’m miserable now.” in both its content and its monotone delivery, the line addresses the ways our technological access leads to a kind of internal deadening. “bookmarks” is even more direct: “all day at work / stare at computer/ come home from work / stare at computer,” drilling down on the banality of constant access. it’s not all screens, though: on opener “how did this happen?!,” bodega lament how technology has led to political complacency and “slacktivism”; “can’t knock the hustle,” with its quips about nine-dollar smoothies and hourly salaries—and a sardonic chorus that goes, “you can’t knock the hustle / when the cats are making capital”—is an anti-capitalist anthem that socialist organizations could adopt as their fight song. such straightforward lyricism demands music that’s equally unflashy, and bodega’s simple, wiry arrangements rise to the occasion. the songs are built from little more than slightly overdriven guitars, simple, driving drums, and belfiglio and hozie’s yelped vocals. just as bodega’s lyrics plainly and boldly analyze our current state, so too are the songs striking in their direct, yet incisive, arrangements."

d7468,"astral projection asc electronic the story of 21st century club music has been less one of step-change—dramatic developments like house, techno, drum & bass, or trance—than one of the evolution of the subtler tendencies within and across genres. one of the most crucial of these has been slowness. in dubstep’s half-step lurch, experimental electronica like andy stott and arca, alt-r&b, post-flylo beat-scene psychedelics, berlin techno’s retreat from pounding extremes—even the reggaetón-influenced mainstreaming of tropical house—there was a retreat from the idea of beat as “driving” and into looser, more limber relationships between drum programming and dancers’ bodies. one of the most interesting crucibles for this experimentation has been a half-tempo zone in drum & bass. artists like dbridge, om unit, sam binga, japan’s ena, and san diego’s asc have in various ways opened up d ‘n’ b’s spaces and saved it from the harder-faster-denser sonic arms races that drove some of its variants into an evolutionary dead end. asc has taken those lessons and started applying them to other templates. having spent his last two albums on entirely ambient drones, he’s now exploring a place completely between genres—using the same moody sound palette as his previous records, but going across the tempo range, and crucially using patterns of three beats, rather than the 4/4 patterns of 99.99% of dance records. oddly, despite this unorthodox rhythmic approach, the record sounds strangely familiar: the tonality, the flow, the bodily impact of the sub-bass, all echo early dubstep, drexciya-style detroit electro, and asc’s own half-step d ‘n’ b. yet as you get absorbed into the swirling waltzes, they will take you to strange, intergalactic places. certainly adventurous djs could play this too—and the dances that people will do should prove to be pretty interesting."

d7471,"colt hilary woods ambient, dark ambient hilary woods’s musical career has been marked by surprising turns, first as the bassist for the once-popular irish rock band jj72, and then as an award-winning performance artist, film composer, and sound designer for horror films. perhaps it was the latter that has made her adept at translating complex feelings—like desire, loneliness, and desolation, to name a few—into intricately crafted electronic folk compositions. nothing is gratuitous with woods. the silences are calculated, the percussion is sparse, reverberating like heavy footsteps in an empty corridor; the synths soar momentarily, then wither away. it’s music that leaves you in a strangely pensive state. that feeling forms the backbone of her debut album, where the dublin-based musician carefully uses string arrangements, acoustic guitars, tape fuzz, piano, and synths to soundtrack her journey through grief, self-acceptance, abandonment, and a shape-shifting love. the album opens with “inhaler,” a track consisting of nothing more than a bare piano, synths, and percussion, showcasing both woods’s velvety vocals and her poetic prowess. it’s a beautiful song, as unsettling as it is comforting, where woods deals with the sadness and uncertainty of lost love. on “inhaler,” the notes are enveloped in echo, a technique that makes her yearning feel that much more palpable. “kith” is a solemn ballad, anchored by an acoustic guitar and underscored by a barely-there synth line that sounds like the low howl of the wind. the music perfectly echoes lyrics that talk about feeling suffocated and trying to find a place to breathe. is an album full of such overwhelming moments, where it becomes clear that woods has been traveling a long, difficult path. but there are also moments of sudden respite: “jesus said” is predominantly beat-based, with woods juxtaposing a delicate classical piano with a dance rhythm, making for a tense listen about emptiness and doubt. on woods proves herself to be an accomplished composer, reveling in the nuances and carefully weaving melodies, sounds, and instruments into a sonic landscape that provides a place for comfort and healing—not just for the listener, but for woods as well."

d7494,"hunchin’ all night hunee electronic, dance ’s frenetic, oft-shoeless dj sets have netted him breathless fans in nearly every corner of the globe, due in part to his ability to travel through genres and decades with inimitable ease. go to a hunee set, and you’re as likely to bask in vintage slo-mo from brazil as you are bone-shaking techno—often in the same hour. and while the artist born hun choi is known for laser focus behind the decks (sometimes intimidatingly so), he still manages to find time to twirl around the booth, eyes closed, hands in the air. his selections are both carefully placed and effortlessly dropped, blurring time in a way where speed or style matter less than uplifting energy. his special vibe in the booth carries through on his few but lauded forays into production and curation. his debut 2015 album for , the adventurous dutch label and record shop captained by his crate-digging confidante antal heitlager, flipped swiftly between haunting downtempo, wiggly house, and cavernous techno. he helped bring back classic tracks from japanese deep house don with during the same year, including some of his own coveted edits across two dazzling discs—all the while playing hundreds of sets a year ranging from smoky, underground parties in brooklyn to some of the world’s biggest festivals. his latest project for rush hour, , collects four decades of rare, exquisite music that—like his dj marathons—are in one way or another danceable, but not limited to purely electronic selections. he kicks off with the calming portuguese melodies of carlos maria before turning towards the african continent for heavy tunes from malian artist boncana maïga and benin’s stanislas tohon, whose glittering afro-disco anthem “owhaaou! (raphael top-secret edit)” provides one of the album’s most blissful moments. he includes treasured dance cuts—larry heard’s skittering piano jam “burning 4 you,” and ron trent’s remix of blak beat niks’ “ritual of love,” a tune that, not long ago, would run you a cool $400 on discogs. the album comes to a close with a sprawling detroit techno workout from kenny larkin’s dark comedy alias, another homage to hunee’s known affinity for the often rare seminal tracks of american house and techno innovators. a worldly mixture of sounds that touches on a multitude of pleasure points, shows just what makes hunee one of the most curious, open, and delightful minds in music."
d7495,"jericho sirens hot snakes throughout the 30 minutes of , hot snakes’ first full-length release in 14 years, the san diego quintet sound as if they’re pushed to their limits. hot snakes have always been a loud and abrasive band, but there’s a manic energy at work on their fourth album that feels unexpectedly urgent for a band who have spent the better part of the past decade-and-a-half offstage and out of the studio. on the 78-second standout “why don’t it sink in?”, john reis’s guitar sounds lethal in its barbed-wire scrape, and vocalist rick froberg screeches out the song’s title. a song this brief, noisy, and unrelenting doesn’t offer the listener much of a chance to let sink in—you just endure and survive it. much like their short, explosive songs, the first wave of hot snakes’ career was also brief and concentrated: three albums in five years and an unceremonious (if temporary) end, brought about by grown-up responsibilities like fatherhood. within six years, the band slowly made their way back to festival stages, eventually followed by the unlikely reunion of froberg and reis’s other band, drive like jehu, before hot snakes finally made it to the studio six years into their comeback. and it’s hard not to hear that band’s complex post-hardcore sensibility seething through the twisted time signatures and discordance of tracks like “candid cameras.” at its core, bears all of the elements that made up hot snakes’ excellent first trio of albums: a sharp clash of guitars, pummeling punk-rock rhythms, and froberg’s frantic, strained bark. yet there’s even more tension and agitation than usual, even for a band whose discography is founded on that very agitation. on “psychoactive,” the band’s wall of guitars is dense and imposing, while the churning title track evokes the nickname of german propaganda symbol in an ominous metaphor for trump’s america: “started as a whisper / now it’s a campaign.” only closing track “death of a sportsman” allows much space in, an ominous organ riff reminiscent of suicide’s “ghost rider” rumbling under the feedback and reverb. but even that comes roaring back seemingly more potent than how it began. it’s a fitting metaphor for the band itself, who prove that which burns brightest can still be reignited."
d7496,"of abstract dreams sun ra jazz, free jazz, spiritual jazz in 1974, sun ra found a musical home on the university of pennsylvania campus, in the studio of public radio station wxpn. it was a scrappy, student-run venture, and a great spot for a jazz composer and self-proclaimed alien. he’d record at the station several times until 1980. for sun ra, an afrofuturist who believed true peace for black people resided in outer space, finding solace anywhere on earth was quite a surprise. newly released by art yard, collects a portion of the music sun ra performed on wxpn. here, the cosmic jazz icon plays alternate versions of “island in the sun,” “new dawn,” “unmask the batman” and “i’ll wait for you,” tweaking the tracks’ arrangements while maintaining the songs’ original structures. take “island…” as an example: a from 1974’s , sun ra quickens the rhythm with thicker percussion, adding harmonic chants that bolster the track’s divine essence. “unmask the batman” is also given new life on this set: with its deep scatting, piano stabs and winding horns, the song properly retains the original’s blustery swing. then there’s “i’ll wait for you,” a robust funk-fusion cut that appears on . a love story occurring across “many light years in space,” the stripped-down composition allows sun ra’s vocals to cut through, giving them adequate shine. is the sound of a true genius fully aligned with his spirituality. though the artist had long mastered the path of space travel through music, this set feels decidedly comfortable, as if he’d finally ascended to a higher level of consciousness. while is a fleeting glimpse, it’s still an essential stop in sun ra’s grand voyage."
d7497,"129 dreamless gmg erica eso alternative erica eso is a modern art project disguised as a pop group. led by weston minissali (who also plays synths in cloud becomes your hand), the group began as a bedroom experiment that gradually expanded outward until it landed on the disappearing border between the avant and popular. their debut lp, , was mostly a minissali solo affair, but on , they’ve added a full band, with rhonda lowry on drums, nathanial morgan on bass, and ellen o and angelica bess on backing vocals. over the course of its 30 minutes, repeatedly disintegrates the notion of genre, concocting pop tunes for museums and left-field gems for the club. on album opener “gun-metal grey,” a melting synth line locks in with a stadium-ready drum beat beneath minissali’s falsetto, which sounds a bit like david longstreth might after years of vocal lessons. the track feels like a lost b-side, full of sleek mystery and slithering ambience. elsewhere, on “love-gun,” the band is awash in layers of haze as minissali sings, “i’m gonna get a house and forget everybody,” as if he’s trying to convince himself that, in our interconnected world, escape is still possible. the group execute the stacked vocal harmonies that open “vaccination free” like a note-perfect queen cover band, before giving way to heat-warped synths and stuttering drums. a record this heady could easily be bogged down by the weightiness of its concept—pop melodies set against decidedly abstract instrumentation. but on erica eso handle it effortlessly. the result is a brilliant balancing act between the immediate and the obtuse."
d7498,"now only album of the day: mount eerie alternative when phil elverum’s wife of 13 years, geneviève castrée, passed away in july 2016, he responded by penning a series of songs that became mount eerie’s 2017 album . where that record examined the short-term impact of death, elverum’s new album explores how to live in the months and years that follow. the time since, has been marked by artistic highs for elverum—he returned to live performance for the first time since 2014, and the record was met with widespread acclaim. but it also, understandably, was colored by emotional lows. paints a picture of a man navigating that divide. about halfway through ’s title track, he describes performing “these death songs to a bunch of young people on drugs” at a music festival, talking with fellow artists about songwriting, before noting that “to be alive felt so absurd.” then comes the track’s gently melodic chorus, which begins, “people get cancer and die.” as that line indicates, makes much use of surprise—emotional transitions happen quickly, as the dark wash of guitar on “tintin in tibet” makes way for a fingerpicked passage, above which elverum recounts early romance with castrée. ’s unpredictability feels like a mirror of elverum’s internal disorientation, finding reminders of his wife in unlikely places—while traveling, playing in his yard, making his daughter breakfast. on “distortion,” he wonders, “is it my job now to hold whatever’s left of you for all time?” elverum is too honest on to offer an answer to that question, but as “distortion” nears its conclusion, he offers something softer and warmer: “in his tears right now,” he sings, “light gleams.”"
d7499,"new path essaie pas electronic essaie pas’ 2016 album, (“tomorrow is another night”)—their first for dfa records— as the new, cool, slightly stoic faces of electronic music. the montreal outfit’s mix of techno, ebm, industrial, and electro called to mind the gray soundscapes of berlin’s electronic music underground in the ’90s, yet their take on the music felt fresh and extremely relevant in today’s grim political landscape. the fusion of pierre guerineau and marie davidson’s hard, thumping beats, and airy, eerie vocals—which were often used to decry the isolation, vices, and pitfalls of the late-stage capitalism—made for a sensual soundtrack to a dystopian world. despite employing synth lines that sound like the aural equivalent of , essaie pas still managed to maintain a tangible sense of hope. their new album, puts them on a slightly different path within that same journey. heavily influenced by philip k. dick’s 1977 sci-fi novel about a hellish orange county, california of the future, explores a world of addiction, loss, grief, and panoptic surveillance via explosive basslines, subdued synths, and distorted vocals. the album opens with “les aphides,” a track with a menacing bassline that, listened to via headphones, feels like it’s throbbing inside your skull. paired with davidson’s unsettling whispers, the song sets the mood for a record that, much like is full of paranoid intensity. “futur parlé” and “complet brouillé” sport industrial synths and electro beats, making for the kind of music that could score an apocalyptic party scene during the climax of a sci-fi film. “les agents des stups,” with its speedy synths, space-like blips, and racing hi-hats, offers a momentary reprieve, but as guerineau points out in the album notes, this moment of relief is an illusion—the opening of a doorway that may ultimately lead nowhere. is a dizzying, intense, and rewarding ride into an unsettling future, offering glimpses of darkness and light in equal measures."
d7500,"synthetic core 88 equip electronic, chiptune back in 2016, chicago-based producer released , an epic amalgam of jrpg soundtracks and vaporwave sensibilities that was in its genre. now, equip returns with an even more impressive follow-up, . as before, is a loving tribute to the soundtracks of ’90s rpgs like and . however, in contrast to the laptop-based simulations of , the sophomore effort has been composed using a roland sound canvas 88. first released in 1994, this is the same general midi unit that jrpg composers such as nobuo uematsu ( ) and yasunori mitsuda ( ) used to compose their masterpieces. its 18-bit output and 654 preset tones may be sonically limited compared to today’s available hardware, but ironically its use makes the album even more resonant and affecting. tracks like “bygone dreams” and “flora awakens” employ compressed, harp-like arpeggios and airy orchestration to create stirring, meditative songs. together with more rousing, dynamic numbers like “pontiff’s pass” and “synthetic core 88 awakens,” they invite a strong sense of narrative and thematic progression, a quality bolstered by drew wise’s excellent -inspired visual art. equip describes their sounds as “period-accurate.” this is true, but what’s remarkable about the piano-driven “new gaia” or the tautly atmospheric “scarred streets, oppressed town” is not only do they sound like an old jprg, they also dupe the listener into thinking that they’ve played the game it scores before, even though no such game exists. it’s this false remembrance that gives extra emotional power; the feeling of nostalgia for something that never existed only heightens the album’s rich poignancy."
d7501,"blueprint alice bag alternative, punk rock it’s difficult to believe that is only alice bag’s second solo album, but one thing is clear from the outset: more than four decades into a wide-ranging musical career—she fronted and co-founded ’70s punk pioneers the bags, and has also played with castration squad, cholita, and las tres—the musician/writer/educator is no stranger to galvanizing pivots. to that end, is more eclectic than bag’s 2016 self-titled effort. (both albums were produced by lysa flores.) brash horns punctuate the upbeat soul-rocker “stranger,” “sparkling path” boasts twitching guitars that are twisted into post-punk contortions, and “shame game” is a disco-blues strut driven by funky piano and slippery grooves. the vulnerable “adrift” is even more stunning: it’s a queasy breakup waltz with plaintive piano, melancholy cello accents, and bag’s brassy vibrato. as that song demonstrates, bag’s ability to zero in on (and dissect) emotional, physical, and political turmoil is key to ’s power. “invisible” describes a man losing himself to alcohol dependency, while “77,” a churning girl-group punk cyclone bolstered by invective from kathleen hanna and bratmobile’s allison wolfe, is an unsparing condemnation of income inequality—specifically, how a woman makes 77 cents to every dollar a man makes: “it’s not right / it’s bad for women / and worse if you’re not white.” ’s moving closing track, “white justice,” is even more incisive. bag wrote the song about the 1970 chicano moratorium, a peaceful mexican-american-driven anti-vietnam war protest turned deadly after police intervention. at the end of the tune, she links this tragedy to the fact that the decades-old “struggle” is still relevant today. “you say justice is colorblind / i know you’re lying,” she sings, before leaning forcefully into the line, “white justice is a travesty.” despite these somber moments, ripples with optimism. of note is the hollering pogo “turn it up,” which advises that it’s never too late to shed toxic and dishonest people (if not your own baggage), and start over: “you made a playlist and it’s locked into your head / toss it out, play something new instead.” on , bag asserts that change is necessary—but, perhaps more important, she also believes it’s possible."
d7502,"the b​-​music of jean rolli various artists soundtrack french director jean rollin’s cult sexploitation vampire films are a specialist interest. fans love pop surrealist details like the crotch-sucking vampire bats, incongruous clown costumes, and ubiquitous opera capes. others are likely to find the slow-motion chases and interminable s&m softcore set pieces a chore to sit through. the soundtracks are a different matter, though. the music is a hip sexadelic mélange, veering with giddy bloodlust from pop lounge to avant dissonance and back again. pierre raph’s “gilda & gunshots” from (1973) juxtaposes breathy female gasps with pistol blasts, strutting bass, and hepped-up percussion to create a go-go dance chase scene complete with cheekily orgasmic false starts and stops. acanthus’s “la chateau” from (1971) gets into a deep purple-esque heavy rock groove, which dissipates into druggy atmospheric noodling before locking back in. yvon gerault’s quasi-bach riff “blue doll baroque” from (1970) is a charming toccata and fugue pastiche, with the obligatory fleet final passages juxtaposed with the shuffling of chains. the most striking track, though, is françois tusques’s “croque weasel” from (1968). tusques was an important french free-jazz pianist, and the most famous composer to work on rollin’s films. this one-minute track is bracingly abstract, starting with sawing atonal strings, and moving through plucking and piano banging; someone tries to pick up a funk beat but is subsumed by ambient crowd noise. it sounds like a mod party in a graveyard awkwardly collapsing in on itself. another selection by tusques, “golden panther,” throws an alarm clock into the middle of a debussy arrangement. fans of morricone’s odder experiments will be delighted. the whole album, with its tonal shifts and unexpected stylistic detours, is an appealing evocation of all the fractured and groovy creatures of the night, even if (or maybe especially if) you haven’t ever seen a rollin film."
d7503,"the incubus of karma mournful congregation metal, doom it’s been nearly seven years since australian funeral doom dealers mournful congregation blessed us with a new full-length, and they’ve decided to make up for lost time by delivering an album that clocks in at 80 minutes. for just about any other band, this would be indulgent at best, suicidal at worst. but the fact that seems to sprawl into infinity is appropriate: this is the kind of music that needs room to breathe. its six songs don’t play out so much as they , slouching on slow-motion chord explosions toward gloriously crestfallen climaxes. and while the imperial instrumentals “the indwelling ascent” and the acoustically-driven title track—both bejeweled with gorgeous, twin guitar harmonies—breeze by at a mere 3:11 and 5:49 respectively, the other four songs push up against the 20-minute mark. in other words, if you’re looking for a quick metal fix, this might not be the album for you. but to pass on would be to miss out on some of the most majestic music being created today. glacially-paced and gilded with crystalline melodies, thundering epics like “whispering spiritscapes” and “scripture of exaltation and punishment” seem to emanate from some cavernous pit in the earth’s molten core. vocalist/guitarist damon good’s spectral moan rumbles like some ominous warning from beyond the grave, and the lead guitars sound as though they’ve been beamed down from the far reaches of the galaxy. the forlorn organ intro of “the rubaiyat”—a reference to persian quatrains—gives way to a booming vocal incantation and more of those gorgeous guitars. in the end, feels like a meeting point between the furthest reaches of the galaxy and the deepest recesses of planet earth, but its origins are ultimately beside the point. whether from the stars above or a small town in australia, is incredible."

d7505,"sunspots jeff snyder experimental by turns mischievous, sinister, and soulful, is a reminder that the synthesizer’s possibilities are endless. recorded in stockholm on a vintage buchla, the double-lp debut from jeff snyder has a clever structure: disc 1 lures the listener in with wigged-out, funhouse roughage before disc 2 prescribes intensive, cranial massage therapy. at the outset, the princeton, nj-based musician’s homemade sequencer eagerly twists and crimps the buchla’s golden tones. “sunspots iv” resembles an out-sound survey course, its autechre-esque pocks, pops, and swoops next door to astringent, three-dimensional tonalities and bloodshot, klaxon chords. blearier and more crepuscular, “sunspots v” corrals its movements into a collective, minimalist simmer. on s back-end, snyder marshals his improvisational powers. “sunspots viii” is broiling psychedelia, the ringing pitch it builds to suggest hula-hoops circulating like insects in slow motion. meanwhile, closer “sunspots ix” layers bass chords to discordant distraction; the elongated result—a generative, thrumming brownout drone, restless, endless, somehow obscene—feels so hideously that, ultimately, it’s marvelously ."

d7510,"la contra ola various artists electronic, synthwave the curators of , a new collection of synthwave and post-punk from spain, present their new compilation with a handy contextual sidebar. punk rock, they explain, soundtracked much of spain’s early ’80s, when the country was still emerging as a democracy. but punk was largely commandeered by the record industry and made safe for mass consumption. the country’s true sonic rebels, they explain, were pioneers of electronic music—a few of whom achieved success, most of whom toiled in obscurity. ’s first two tracks set the stage for just how far-flung a compilation this is. prolific madrid industrial act esplendor geométrico, who self-released and distributed their cassettes in the early ’80s, open things up with “moscú está helado.” it’s a severe dance jam that’s a bit of an anomaly among the group’s early ambient sound experiments—cassettes of which the duo both self-released and distributed to their cult audience. the second track, zombies’ “extraños juegos,” is at the other end of the musical spectrum—a candy-coated, reverb-heavy surf pop tune with robotic drumming and chaotic synth interludes. unlike esplendor geométrico, zombies signed to rca and experienced considerable mainstream success in spain before their untimely disintegration. there are some familiar sounds here: todotodo’s “autogas” is a funky twist on kraftwerk, while de picnic’s “jeanette me quiere” and la fura dels baus’ “mareâ” sound reminiscent of afrika bambaataa or herbie hancock tracks from around the same era. more often, though, this is music that brims with explosive possibility. derribos arias’s “a flúor,” one of their two excellent contributions, is a particularly gorgeous soundscape that nods at dub, punk, and flamenco. diseño corbusier’s tracks are minimal and focused, employing bulbous synths that echo across the full stereo spectrum (it’s easy to see why they’ve been rediscovered and celebrated in recent years). and el humano marrano’s “himno” is a raw and youthful slice of punk energy—it sounds like domi delgado jogging in place while he sings—channeled through syncopated blips and bleeps. many of ’s artists were using the same new drum machines and synthesizers in their music, but they set off in any number of exciting directions. the comp, released by the fantastic swiss imprint bongo joe, is a fresh and fascinating listen—and lucky for us, the team describes this release as their “first act.”"

d7516,"ucina pover album of the day electronic, avant-garde —the artistic alias of finnish born, glasgow-based musician maria rossi—is a phrase taken from the austere cooking methods of the peasants in southern italian regions after world war ii. while the culinary style was, at the time, an ingenious (and somewhat desperate) adaptation to the harsh economic conditions in europe at the time, rossi has taken it more as a philosophical inspiration. her ethos is doing more with less, eschewing the use of the fancy equipment normally associated with experimental electronic music production and instead creating compositions out of simple elements: found sounds she records in her home, and on walks around the scottish metropolis; minimalist synths, sparse percussion, and layered harmonies she creates with her own voice. the results are ethereal, meditative and, upon closer listens, slightly spiritual. in that way, cucina povera’s debut album, is a powerful study in limits. by using a deliberately restricted sonic palette, she directs the listener towards the beauty, the sadness, and the surprise that can be found in the most mundane details. the opener, “demetra,” is built around two looped samples: one of rossi hissing into a microphone and another of her harmonizing with herself. she shrouds these elements in reverb and complements them with a crescendo synth line that eventually fades into—like most of her compositions—silence. the follow-up track, “kuparirumpu,” features a solo-choir with three distinct melodies that seem to expand and contract throughout the song, all of them in a tense competition with rossi’s vocalizations. she follows this path—building around natural elements—throughout most of using the spellbinding effects of chants and repetition to paint a picture of bucolic simplicity and strange, fraught beauty. throughout the album, rossi takes advantage of the possibilities of darkness and the heavier aspects of minimal electronic music. “avainsana” is a mind-bending trip, where she lures the listener in with a haunting, low-end synth line and a looped sample of what sounds like water leaking into a metal sink. her voice then clears the way for a techno kick drum, which falls by the wayside just before the song ends. “totean,” the album closer, is an outlier, resting primarily on low-frequency oscillators and ending with rossi sporadically speaking. with rossi seems to want us to follow her into a game of possibilities, where even the smallest sounds can nourish the soul, if only we’d let them."

d7530,"nothing valley melkbelly alternative, indie melkbelly’s opens with a ripper. “off the lot,” the lead track from the chicago quartet’s first full-length, is a two-and-a-half minute long burst of raw energy, full of distorted guitar, pummeling drums, and vocals that accelerate from an urgent sing-song to an earth-scorching scream. it’s a taut, brutalizing beginning, and one that quickly encapsulates melkbelly’s specific brand of intense, tightly-knit rock ‘n’ roll. if feels instinctual, it’s for good reason. prior to forming in 2013, all four of melkbelly’s players had been collaborating in some form within chicago’s diy scene. they’re also all practically (or actually) family: vocalist/guitarist miranda winters is married to guitarist bart winters, his brother liam winters plays bass, and drummer james wetzel is a longtime friend. separately, their lists of influences and past projects run the gamut from folk-pop to punk to experimental noise. and together, they create a perfectly choreographed push and pull of twisting rhythms, anxious harmonies, and thrashing dissonance. built on the foundation laid by their 2014 ep, goes harder and louder. it also captures the awesome physicality of melkbelly’s sweat-drenched live shows. like on “twin lookin motherfucker,” where wetzel’s drumming switches between metallic beats and breakneck fills, and miranda’s sneering-but-sweet vocals play tug of war with bart’s fuzz-addled guitar. “kid kreative” finds miranda spitting snide lyrics about getting style-jacked by a male musician, her voice gamely fighting for top billing over a rising tide of percussion. even in the quieter moments, melkbelly seems to thrive on sonic tension. on “cawthra,” trembling bass parts and whispered lines about being blindfolded and “forced to stay out late” clash with bombastic choruses of mincing guitar noise. the band has said that was inspired, at least in part, by touring around the west coast. but in place of the wide-eyed wistfulness that usually comes with the territory, they’ve turned the tour-as-muse trope into an album full of careening stop-starts and palpable nervous energy. in other words, it’s the true sound of a sitting shoulder-to-shoulder on a too-long drive with all of the ones you love. —"
d7531,"hesaitix m.e.s.h. electronic, soundscapes “a sound can be both formless and over-rendered,” producer m.e.s.h. claims in a press release, “like a boneless but fleshy hand from a life drawing class.” if that’s a metaphor for the state of underground electronic music, it’s an apt one: the scene has been awash with deliberately obtuse experiments for years, often under the banner of “deconstructed club music.” though that term has been applied to m.e.s.h.’s music, it’s not completely accurate. since his 2014 breakthrough, , the music james whipple makes as m.e.s.h. has explored both the functional needs of the club and the expressive power of abstraction, challenging assumptions about dual premises that are often viewed as an either-or proposition. on , he proves how limiting those premises are. on 2015’s , m.e.s.h. applied the techniques of to sonic world building, contemplating information overload with an arsenal of broken drums and pneumatic instrumentation. 2016’s ep followed newton’s third law, reacting to those paranoid soundscapes with a handful of club-ready reconstructions that overwhelmed the senses. is the culmination and evolution of those works, building an abstract, techno-organic world but from within the club. that’s apparent from the first track, “nemorum incola,” which lives up to its title (latin for “the inhabitants of forests”), mixing bird calls and machine hum as if a mecha is exploring the jungle in three dimensions. the mecha cuts back the brush to reveal “mimic,” a layered composition that sees a three-note melody mutate to rhythm of organic hand drums and a fractured two-step shuffle before everything falls apart. that creation and destruction is apparent throughout the album, as individual tracks serve as self-contained experiments in juxtaposition, whether it’s the polyrhythmic battle of “2 loop trip” or the chainsaw synths and robotic call and response of “search. reveal.” yet the experimental flourishes do not undermine the propulsive drive of the album: “coercer” is noisy techno hypnosis, “diana triplex” is seductive with something lurking beneath the groove, and “signal ride drum” moves through space like a rollercoaster inside a drum machine. the ride eventually ends, with the gorgeous, baroque chords of “ihnaemiauimx.” not only does it call back ’s beatless “jester’s visage,” but it closes the album on a somber, meditative note as we leave this lush—and fully constructed—world m.e.s.h. has created."

(pfaff is into science, it seems; the lyrics to the band’s only other release, the ep, are full of references to bugs and guts.) “i keep thinking you’ll apologize if i give it some time / if i give it some time,” pfaff sings on “skate ramp.” the song is soft, raw, naked, and every note of muted electric guitar is punctuated by the sounds of fingers sliding across the strings to find their next position. every word is murmured and echoing. “sometimes pain brings us back to where we gotta be,” pfaff concludes. as is often the case on , the specifics are left to the imagination. all we really hear about is the aftermath, the wounds that won’t close. pfaff’s intimate lyrics are frequently numbed by their semi-detached vocal delivery, sounding not so much weary as steadfast. they never scream, never linger, even when the pace quickens. on the handful of genuine rock songs on , pfaff’s words convey deadpan frustration and disappointment while the drums give you something to nod to. “radio” and “natural things” are catchy and lovely, the former boasting a cockeyed guitar line and brittle percussion, the latter rolling along on a loping bassline. “oats,” the record’s longest song at two minutes and 14 seconds, even shreds a little bit at the end; the song’s gently-whirling guitar line slowly growing fangs. and another rocker, “small space,” offers the album’s most resolute approach to hurt, again expressing it in earthly terms: “photosynthesis / take a harsh light and turn it into energy.” —"

d7549,"s/t rainer maria alternative, indie in the early days, rainer maria was a band of shouters. the crashing drums, the thunderous guitar, the serpentine bass—the trio created a mountain of sound that, it seemed, could only be scaled by caithlin demarrais and kaia fischer screaming their heads off. it was glorious and youthful, but it was also unsustainable. by the time the band moved from madison to brooklyn in the late ’90s, they were already looking for ways to pretty up their sound, lest demarrais lose more and more shows to shredded vocals cords. “pretty” was something rainer maria aspired to anyway, of course; the increasingly softening force of the music left room for soft thoughts and complicated emotional revelations. the band that, on its first album, had belted out the most emo line of all time—“call an ambulance, i don’t want to walk home alone” on the track “tinfoil”—was now summoning mature and peculiar moments of grace. , released in 2006, was instantly appealing and the band’s best attempt at balancing the musical id with the lyrical superego. song after song predicted the end of the world. on the heavier tracks (“life of leisure” and “catastrophe,” in particular), they put their sweetest thoughts on asteroids and let them burn up, sometimes with explosive results. and then there were the gentler songs, like “terrified,” which demarrais sang with awesome bewilderment and fragility: “on these old streets, i can’t believe you’re not walking next to me / i can almost feel your hand in my back pocket.” by then, she’d long become the lead singer. fischer was best making her presence felt with moody, muscular guitarwork that provided endless opportunities for the band to go nuts in exhilarating ways. having achieved the kind of underappreciated perfection that mostly leaves you gasping for air in hot basement shows, the band called it quits later that year. a return did not seem inevitable, but it came, first with reunion shows and now with , a comeback album that makes progress on all the things this restless band has always done well. self-titled albums are handy for bands looking to make a statement, that statement usually being, “here we are.” rainer maria already dropped an album called a long time ago, so this one’s called , and it’s a statement by a band reborn—“here we are .” a lot has happened in the 11 years since . demarrais released two complicatedly pretty solo records and started a family. fischer studied tibetan buddhism and came out as transgender. drummer bill kuehn traveled the world, studying music and living in syria and yemen, among other places. produced by kuehn, is rainer maria at their brightest. the songs bubble with nervous energy. many are loud. several are joyous, in a we’re-still-alive kinda way. bolstered by fischer, demarrais’s voice finds new depth, and comes closer to shouting than it has in a long time. this band is fired up. “let the rest of the world be coarse / you stay sweet for me,” demarrais implores on the blazing and catchy “suicides and lazy eyes.” that song leads directly into “lower worlds,” an artful and unexpectedly groovy rocker bolstered by fischer’s fierce backup vocals. “communicator” is fun and ferocious, shot through with rocketing punk energy. if there’s any of that that old apocalyptic angst left, it’s turned inward. on opener “broke open love,” crashing cymbals and heavy guitar dissipate for a hopeless refrain—“i know, i know, i’m fucking up / i don’t want to fuck up”—then return with a vengeance. demarrais’s bass never stops careening and coiling. “i’ll never be alone if i can help it / talkin’ to the flowers just to have a friend,” she sings on “forest mattress,” one of several songs that reference the natural world as a place of mystery and refuge. the slow and spooky “hellbore” swoons with softly spoken words and long, angular chords, recalling the shadowy beauty of mazzy star. the hellbore, by the way, is an oddball in the arboreal world: it’s pretty and it’s poisonous, and it blooms in winter. a fitting metaphor for a band made both prettier and more ferocious by its own remarkable evolutionary journey. —"

d7596,"silver haze aye nako alternative, indie , the latest from the brooklyn group aye nako, is a ragged, marvelous, coiled blast of noise, a dozen songs sewn up in barbed-wire guitar and sporting immediate, ruthlessly melodic vocal melodies. there are subtle nods toward the early days of indie rock—the hi-distortion approach of superchunk and archers of loaf, the bent-wire guitars of polvo and helium—but not a second of feels derivative or, worse, nostalgic. instead, aye nako start with a familiar template and then smudge and redraw it according to their own designs. the world in which these songs exist is, realistically, a dangerous one. “tell me what i need to stay safe on the streets” goes the chorus to “sissy,” and the slow-creeping “nightcrawler,” with its spider-leg guitars, imagines “exorcism on a billboard stage” and “false needles in my neck.” in the roiling “the gift of hell,” the protagonist ends up “drinking with statues at grand army plaza,” and the bitter sentiment is paired with a big, soaring melody. the oppositional stance is key to who aye nako are—passionate believers in the value of diy spaces, who seek to operate outside the commerce-driven music scene. they grapple often with identity—the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality operate in differing ways for the four band members, and exploring these traumas together provides a sense of healing—and they distill their anger, frustration, and iconoclasm into songs that feel urgent and vital. that the songs on are so unfailingly melodic makes their lyrics land that much harder. a skipping guitar trips along the background of “spare me” before the song erupts into full-throated howl; “the gift of hell” juxtaposes 20-ton stoner riffs with a haunting, delicate vocal line. and “tourmaline” is a mini-epic, moving from a slow-gliding opening to a knottier, more fitful middle section. it’s this kind of restlessness and inventiveness that makes such a gripping listen. it lulls you into comfort before turning the room upside down. —"
d7597,"horse follows darkness delia gonzalez electronic, piano, atmospheric the backstory behind delia gonzalez’s riveting, moving is almost as rich as the album itself: the album is a kind of soundtrack to gonzalez’s return to america after a sojourn in berlin, but gonzalez also saw parallels between her journey and american western films of the 1960s. that alone is enough to freight the record with an encyclopedia of ideas, everything from manifest destiny to colonialism to the simple idea of an “untamed land” waiting—both ominously and expectantly—for new settlers. what makes the entirely-instrumental so enthralling is that it never tips over into literalism; there are no prairie whistles or lap steels or cleverly-chosen vocal samples. instead, gonzalez explores the idea of travel, transition, and the “myth of america” through feints and suggestions, with spiderwebs of piano and billowing synths. the steadily-chugging “hidden song” is cleft in two by a rude, cutting electric guitar, which slices up the center of gonzalez’s motorik backdrop like an inebriated guest at a formal dinner party. the elements cohere gradually, the precise arrangements of krautrock—its lockstep rhythm, waterfall of piano, and bobbing bassline—gradually subsuming the slashing riffs into themselves. the collision of elements, and the acclimation of one to another, feels packed with portent. the title track is full of shadow and space; gonzalez sketches out a skeletal piano figure, layering linen-like synths on top of it for an end result that feels mournful and isolated. “roulette,” with its dewdrop guitars and gradually-building rhythm, is expectant and apprehensive all at once. and album-closer “vesuvius” covers throbbing techno with black-cloud drones, synths sparkling and vanishing like lightning in the background. there’s no single overarching message to , but that’s precisely what makes it so beguiling. it is simultaneously hopeful and crushing—just like the country it takes as inspiration. —"

(guess which side the band is on.) this is the perfect music for an empire in decline, summoning courage in the face of despair and harnessing rage so it becomes the power to fight back. drummer phillip gonzalez’s steady rhythms lay a solid foundation upon which the rest of the band can build. frontwoman leda ginestra’s bass propels the music forward, like a car speeding through a city at night. guitarist samantha wendel, whose playing glides effortlessly from strident, post-punk noise to urgent, straightforward power chords, rounds out the band’s distinctive brand of dark, brooding punk. it all coheres around ginestra’s versatile vocal delivery. singing in french and english throughout the record, she gives us deadpan incantations (“we are gold”), deep, throaty melodies (“no future”), staccato chants (“le phenix”), and piercing screams (“baudeliare”). there’s a momentum to this album that builds and doesn’t let up. don’t be surprised if you find yourself out of breath by the time it’s over."

d7617,"drip mental fire-toolz as the human experience grows increasingly entangled with technology, the idea of “sensory saturation” has gone from a minor annoyance to an everyday fact of life. music—particularly sample-based music—reflects this; with the advent of mashups and memes, all media has become fair game for recycling and re-use, a process that, at its worst, flattens all of its source sounds, images, and ideas into an endless barrage of kitsch. on the surface, it would be easy to mistake chicago-based electronic producer/multi-instrumentalist for just another mashup artist. on , her second album under the pseudonym , marcloid combines blood-curdling black metal howls with the kind of bubblegum synth-pop that used to soundtrack vhs workout videos in the ’80s. yes, marcloid plays up the contrast between those two elements for maximum absurdity, but is more than just an orgy of stimulation. campy and disturbing at the same time, the album illuminates, challenges, and ultimately makes art out of our relationship with media. the samples on bob and weave in the music like loose space junk—a reverb-drenched smooth-jazz saxophone figure, courtesy of richard elliott, pings against an iconic riff by math metal outfit ; a punchline delivered by cartoon character spongebob squarepants brushes shoulders with a spooky voice whispering “look behind you,” a sample from a halloween item she saw at a big box store. creates an almost dementia-like effect by wrenching its various samples free from any context. marcloid has been releasing music for years under a host of monikers, including ambient titles like last year’s and while she draws from a harsher, denser palette on , her affinity for wide-open soundscapes shines through all the abrasiveness, binding together the music’s disparate sounds. on opening track “subconscious pilsen relics pt 2 [codename_airplane mode],” elliott’s saxophone decays into a vaporous swirl that, for a few seconds at least, aspires to the majesty of, say, vangelis’ score. the album is just as effective when it gets ugly. marcloid’s muffled screams of the words “i dreamt that every man who didn’t fight for me was shot” at the end of “all deth is u [codename_final touch location]” cut through the darkness, evoking a violent kind of anguish. it is in moments like these, or when marcloid sings that “guns don’t kill people unless the guns are me/ in a sea of semen a slug can still be free,” that is at its most disturbingly provocative and, paradoxically, its most human. throughout, marcloid references early-’90s artifacts of internet and computer culture—a sound evoking the familiar that once announced a new e-mail message, the fonts and the tower-style pc that grace the album cover—but she operates in a universe wholly separate from smiley-faced chiptune artists who romanticize dated media formats. as well she should. in the age of gamergate and cyberbullying, we are too well-acquainted with the internet’s menacing underbelly to focus solely on tickling ourselves with its surface joys. though ‘s lens is aimed at the past, it’s hardly nostalgic. instead, it offers stark insights into contemporary online existence. for years, sci-fi and cyberpunk have warned of soon-coming future dystopias. on , that dystopia is , and it’s an internal condition. angel marcloid explores that treacherous terrain with sharp insight and skill."

d7657,"soundscapes for the emotional​-​type listener slow attack ensemble you’d think ambient music would be the last style ever to break the fourth wall. ambient, after all, is about dissolving into the moment, about being enveloped by pure atmosphere. occasionally, an artist will nudge and wink at the self-seriousness of the whole phenomenon, even as they indulge in its vaporous fullness. that was certainly ’s approach, beginning with the self-referential (and mildly self-deprecating) title of 2001’s ; on 2007’s , as they sunk even more deeply into gauzily narcotic arrangements for guitars, strings, and endless reverb, their titles catapulted into the full-on absurd: “another ballad for heavy lids,” “the mouthchew,” “december hunting for vegetarian fuckface.” slow attack ensemble’s —the work of a canadian musician named chuck blazevic—bears a similar tongue-in-cheek approach. perhaps not coincidentally, blazevic’s earlier work under the alias sounded quite a bit like stars of the lid. purported to capture “the elegiac dimensions” of american popular music in the years between ’50s and ’60s rock, though in practice, that goal mostly translates to endless echo and fathomless yearning. (if you’ve heard any of those songs that have been slowed 800 percent that have made their way around the internet, dreamsploitation also sounds a lot like those.) his new album also tackles a specific style and a specific era, but this time, it actually sounds like its subject. in an email, blazevic told me that the album is “heavily inspired by the more minimal and organic elements of 1980s japanese and mediterranean ambient-electronic music.” mixing piano, electric guitar, synthesizer, and copious amounts of reverb, the album could easily be mistaken for the real thing. like the best ambient music, it fades unobtrusively into the background, but there’s just enough there to hold your attention, if you should feel so inclined—what brian eno meant when he said that ambient music should be “as ignorable as it is interesting.” though it’s just 23 minutes long, the album covers an ambitious amount of ground without ever losing focus. the opening “november, 1st in detroit” nicely captures the album’s simple-but-complex qualities by setting a handful of elements—string plucks, airy synthesizer pads, the slightest hint of marimba—in lazy circulation, drifting in and out of phase like tape loops running in parallel. the shifting pulses are reminiscent of the tide lapping against boats in the harbor, and a fluid bass solo offers the album’s most melodic moment. on “mizue,” there’s a hint of harold budd in the watery piano, while “elegy for elodie” takes a more hypnotic approach, running simple piano patterns through multiple delays until their movements resemble the rings left by raindrops in a pond. the album’s second half is more electronic, with quiet synthesizer melodies framed in gentle ambience. an echo of cocteau twins’ pristine guitar tone ripples through “after images,” and the sound of rushing water accompanies the optimistic tones of the closing “landscape of perpetual oblivion.” the most tantalizing of all, though, is the penultimate track, “bells”—a 43-second sketch of synthesizer that transports you to the snowy courtyard of an ancient temple in a small, distant village. there’s no breaking the fourth wall here; as brief as it may be, the illusion is total. —"

d7659,"mr. robot – volume 1 (original television series soundtrack) mac quayle if there is one element that defines the television show more than any other it’s the overarching sense of paranoia. it starts almost from the get-go, with the ominous, unidentified men in black suits who seem to be trailing protagonist elliot alderson no matter where he goes. each new plot twist reveals deeper levels to the show’s overarching conspiracy, making it difficult to determine which characters are trustworthy. over time, that paranoia begins to seep out of the screen and into the viewer; elliott’s dissociative identity disorder makes him the ultimate unreliable narrator and, as the show goes on, it becomes hard to know whether or not the show’s hero—who frequently breaks the fourth wall to speak to us directly—is telling the truth (the whopper of a reveal midway through season two is the perfect illustration of the lengths to which he’s willing to go in order to deceive us). one of his most frequently-repeated requests, “please tell me you’re seeing this, too,” can be read as both a desire for allegiance as well as a test to see if his bait-and-switch with the viewer is working. and so it’s natural that a show that thrives on anxiety should be accompanied by an appropriately anxious soundtrack. the songs by mac quayle on the soundtracks to both the first and are built on low-level synth pulses, the kinds of songs that swell slowly to gradually create an atmosphere of panic that’s suffocating. it would be convenient shorthand to call it “synthwave,” but the music here has none of that genre’s cutting, laser-sword dynamics. instead, it feels more like a robotic ekg: on “1.0_2-oneincontrol.aiff” (the song titles mirror the episode titles’ computer-code structure,” the sound is barely present, just a few rising, misty synths over a blinking, dead-eyed bass note. when the tempos do tick upward, as on “1.0_6-leavem3here.flac,” with its syringe-pokes of guitar, there’s enough space between the notes to let the panic sweat pool. divorced from the show, plays best as discomfort music for insomniac conspiracy theorists. how else to explain “1.3_5-da3m0nsneverstop.ca,” a song whose gentle sawing keyboards seem designed to accompany 3am deep-dives in search of a connection between stanley kubrick and the moon landing. the second volume is darker still, notes barely emerging above a sickening bass rumble—perfect for the underrated season’s more muted, cerebral tone. the net effect is as unnerving as suddenly-recovered memories, as eerie as an abandoned coney island arcade. —"

d7662,"westside industrial m.o.t.h. m.o.t.h.’s is experimental in style and concept; the album imagines a world where culture becomes a commodity, and art is suffering from a serious identity crisis. a tale old as time, really, and like the best science fiction, it feels eerily familiar, a reflection of cities (including composer matthew finch’s current home of brooklyn) reshaped by financial matters and fantasy. finch’s uncomfortably numb narrative is told through two main characters—nameless, faceless visions of “him” and “her” trying to come to grips with a crumbling middle class and a society that sees nothing wrong with branding everyone’s belief system. or, as finch writes in the album’s theatrical liner notes, “i moved out here, to this mecca, because i believed in a story about this culture; because i believed in a myth about opportunity. i had no idea what i was participating in; i had no idea that i was an identity product of the elite knowledge workers of the middle class and acting as a symbol … promoting the culture and lifestyle of bourgeois materialism.” which is really a roundabout way of saying what we all think when a luxe condo building bursts out of concrete, promising a boho lifestyle to all its lessees. as for what that like, finch doesn’t spell anything out. he stretches the storyline across three long instrumentals that alternate between stormy ambient sequences, woofer-wrecking bass lines, and meditative drone tones. remember that no one saw last year? this is what would have happened if was hired to do the score, which was tweaked slightly by the studio—just enough to show a few signs of hope, which glimmer until m.o.t.h.’s next lp, at least."

d7664,"posh lost posh lost bands who operate within the shadowy realm of dark rock tend to post up in one of two extremes: either morose and brooding (joy division, the sound) or fevered and anthemic (the chameleons, lords of the new church). but the minnesota group posh lost have found a way to split the difference. their self-titled debut, released via the venerable mirror universe tapes, is a case study in how to mope majestically. their lineup allows them something of a cheat code: bassist jack woolsey’s low, desolate voice is perfect for the brooders; guitarist jeff cornell’s gently-pleading tenor ideal for the anthems. the result is a record whose 10 songs are as bleak and mossy as an 18th century cemetery, but have a nerviness and intensity that prevents them from feeling waterlogged. “fabricate,” is the perfect example: the guitars prick and poke like bat talons, but woolsey’s dark-prophet vocal style gives its three-word chorus (“she’s not eating”) a chilling ominousness. on “sense of self,” cornell’s voice pulls the melody gracefully upward, the band floating like funeral mist far below. but more than that, posh lost know mood is nothing without the songs to back it up, and they have both; “portraits” is a heartsick ballad that recalls joy division’s “atmosphere,” suffused with soft blue synths and skeletal guitar; it could have been a tossed-off snoozer, but woolsey’s simple, four-note melody makes it feel instant and indelible. “impulse” clatters and rattles, erupting triumphantly at the chorus like a submerged magician finally wriggling free of the straitjacket. posh lost seem to be subconsciously following bruce cockburn’s old dictum about kicking the darkness until it bleeds daylight. their debut offers a welcome, hefty helping of both."

(prior to his sessions with paradinas, james had tried making music with luke vibert and a few other like-minded souls, but none of those tracks ever saw the light of day. still, the sessions with paradinas sound intense, and not only because they spent much of them drunk: “it was strange, the way we worked,” paradinas told when the album was first released. “we didn’t talk a lot. we didn’t talk at all, in fact.”) the best songs still sound exceptionally strange, even today; time has not tempered their weirdness. “eggy toast” is a woozy, brooding meditation in 7/4 time, the scabrous “vodka” captures the duo’s noisiest impulses in full flower, and “the sound of the beady eyes”—the title came to them while tripping on acid—is a meandering, brain-melting organ showcase that might be the closest either of these two ever got to jam-band territory. better yet, this might be the rare occasion where the bonus material actually eclipses some of the original cuts: “waltz,” in particular, unfurls a strangely moving chord progression as it notches up the distortion and delay—it’s as expressive as it is exploratory, in the finest rephlex tradition. —"

d7743,"reginald omas mamode iv reginald omas mamode iv there’s a rich, organic quality to the music of half-mauritian/half-english musician reginald omas mamode iv; the south london composer’s tracks come off as breathing lifeforms that are equally steeped in hip-hop, funk, soul and jazz. those rhythms are woven throughout mamode’s self-titled debut, resulting in his strongest effort to date. if you’re familiar with his work, you’ll hear pieces of this album’s sound across his previous releases, especially last year’s . whereas that project felt a bit looser, is a fully formed collection of rhythmic mantras and tropical sonic arrangements. here, his voice isn’t the main focus: he tweaks it to accentuate the album’s main ingredients—layered drums and tumbling bass lines. he becomes a dilla-esque hype man on “bump it up,” one of the album’s many standouts. elsewhere, on “talk to me,” it sounds like he’s simply freestyling with the beat. that speaks to the heart of the artist and the record as a whole: mamode wants to communicate with listeners, building a natural rapport that slowly draws them into his aesthetic. —"
d7744,"black focus yussef kamaal the south east london district of peckham is known for three things: tower blocks, market traders, and the sitcom . the first two are mostly a consequence of the third. was an iconic british show that aired in the 1980s and ’90s, full of cockney rhyming slang, get-rich-quick hustles and deep-fried fish and chips. the backdrop was dilapidated, underserved and surprisingly white. peckham, and its neighboring area camberwell, form one of the most ethnically-diverse pockets of the united kingdom. it’s a cultural melting pot of black african, black caribbean, asian, indian, white british, and many other ethnicities. for 25 years, it’s been home to some of my family; vietnamese who pitched up there in the early ’90s and have since made it the home of a new generation of british-born children. over the quarter-century, they’ve seen the area develop from the destitution depicted on into one of the capital’s most exciting cultural centers. it’s where south east londoners yussef dayes and kamaal williams—releasing music together as yussef kamaal—came together as teenagers in 2007, bringing their brand of smooth jazz to small crowds in local bars. dayes and williams didn’t plan much before their live performances. they laid out a chord progression, but beyond that, the pair would just , slinking their sound into whatever sonic corners it shifted to organically. that freewheeling approach can be felt on , their first album. call it the great camberwell record—a work that beautifully distills the area, mixing cultures deep into the album grooves. it’s a jazz record in the spirit of blue note’s finest recordings, but this sonic stew incorporates boogie, afrobeat, funk, hip-hop and the spirit of roy ayers, too. the arrangements are satin-smooth. the drums are crisp and funky, and the bass floats majestically throughout the record. “yo chavez” is built around a squelchy synth that’s pure aural candy. the bass-heavy bounce of “lowrider” takes the curbs with a cosmic swagger. it’s ’67 chevy tour of south east london, with nothing but sleek tarmac under the tires. closer “joint 17” encapsulates the album’s freewheeling excellence. the keys purr with soft sophistication, and are accented with popping bass and snaps. the drum breaks could launch 1,000 rap beats, and it’s the exclamation point on one of the year’s best jazz records. in a post-brexit world, where the british legacy of multiculturalism is suffering blow after blow, we needed yussef kamaal to soften the impact. —"
d7745,"ohio earth tongues a look at the lineup of new york’s earth tongues—tuba player , percussionist , and trumpeter —might give some listeners pause. how, exactly, do those components work together, especially within the conventions of improvised music? but earth tongues doesn’t just improvise in the standard terms; they’ve developed their own intuitive rule system and “language.” texture, color, and interplay are usually the key components in freely-improvised music, but this slow-moving beast of a combo goes heavier and deeper than surface aesthetics. together, they create harrowing environments where sounds emerge from silence—colliding, disintegrating, and wriggling in unexpected directions. the music hovers more than it moves, a lumbering, low-impact, largely unpitched din constructed of minimalist gestures, extended technique flurries, and multiple varieties of friction. the two-part work, clocking in at 94 minutes, requires a certain degree of patience, if not total submission. the effort is rewarded. delivers a kind of immersive ambience that almost feels like a field recording. the album cover features a nighttime shot of a fallen branch and leaves nestled within moss-covered boulders, and the sounds contained here fill out that picture. objects are rubbed, horns quietly blubber, pre-recorded sounds on cassettes are smeared into abstraction, and, once in awhile, a recognizable brassy tone coalesces. there are moments when the pieces glide into a more intentional sphere, with unhurried build-ups that produce sudden percussive rumbles, suggesting a martin denny soundtrack for the apocalypse. more often, though, the performances breathe patiently, murmuring like metallic cicadas, elongated bird calls, and distant wolf howls. earth tongues maintains this sound world over the long haul, delivering ever-shifting details and fleeting drama that keep the attentive listener riveted. given the right listener and environment, this is a record that could be downright transportative."
d7746,"tumblers from the vault syrinx after a tumultuous decade of musical experimentation lead by cage and boulez in the concert hall and the beatles on the radio, the ’70s lurched forward. enter john mills-cockell, a toronto-born synth explorer blessed by contact with the electronic avant-garde early in his teens, and his cohorts: the freeform saxophonist doug pringle and mystic/percussionist alan wells. the trio emerged piecemeal and coincidentally: cross-canadian train trips, visits from the good doctor timothy leary, work with cream producer felix pappalardi, interdisciplinary coffeehouse happenings. and yet, a peaceful, studied stillness emanates from the spare output of their group, syrinx. the label collects both of the group’s albums and a smattering of live recordings and other ephemera on : a sumptuous feast for curious listeners. in the handful of non-album material we find the group’s one claim to fame: the song “tillicum”, commissioned by the ctv television network as the theme for a -esque current affairs program called “here come the seventies.” “tillicum” is a pithy introduction to syrinx’s ambitious music; bookended by coast-to-coast washes of oscillating waves, the song races on a track of vaguely robotic, bubbling rhythm, with pringle’s sax calling reveille over top. you can easily imagine the accompanying bustling montage of industrious canadian life, ushering in the churn of a new decade. the single charted briefly (an instrumental made up of keyboard noise, drum machine, sax and no vocals!) and there’s probably canadians of a certain age still humming it to this day. plunging into the rest of syrinx’s discography, one finds far more pastoral pleasures. rvng has seen fit to sequence the group’s second album first; it’s the lone album they recorded outright as a unit and the most powerful evidence of their power as a band. “long lost relatives” finds the group already in flight from the start, with pringle’s ochre-hued sax introducing the proceedings on “tumblers,” before mills-cockell’s curlicues of synth tangle with wells’ charging bongos. “syren” runs pringle’s sax through a synthesizer, encrusting it with a bit of jurassic might recalling “lark’s tongues”-era crimson, before “december angel” provides one of the set’s high points. after a cacophonous minute of scrapes, clangs and insect-like wails, mills-cockell’s moog keys appear, verne-like, far beneath the earth’s surface. slowly, the strings of a borrowed orchestra emerge, as cascading plucks, bells and gongs melt together in a tectonic fluid, thrumming and huge, buoyed slowly back to the surface by bubbles of arp and sax, and the call of some synthetic seagull. it’s a breathtaking piece, and it’s hard to say just what it is. jazz, classical, prog rock, new age? it’s not altogether clear if the members themselves knew. the songs that close disc one come from the group’s 1970 debut, and contain the most delicate syrinx output, culled from mills-cockell’s solo sessions on organ and synth, with pringle and wells later adding sax and hand drum overdubs. these uphold the rvng reissue ethos of rescuing lost relaxation music. “chant for your dragon king” is a stately processional with an overwhelming sense of wistfulness, like mike ratledge playing a funeral march in 14th century wallachia. ‘appaloosa-pegasus’ channels riley, hitching buzzing synth to wells’ galloping tabla, while ‘hollywood dream trip’ evokes the woozy, implacable bliss-state of . syrinx may have only blessed the world with two lps, but they didn’t waste a moment on each."
d7747,"flea waltz frederic robinson some albums seem to have more in them than others—more space for sound to bounce around. , the second album from german artist frederic robinson, is one of those records. it opens with “constellations,” a more-or-less familiar form of electronic pop, with breathy vocals supplied by lily juniper. but it’s on the second track, “acrylic,” where robinson’s spatial acuity becomes clear. the song is full of programmed percussion and melodic synthesizer lines, but they all occupy their own space, arranged with a seeming aversion to density. cramming that much sound into a song could be dizzying, but robinson’s clean sense of sound-design steers clear of clutter, arriving instead at a sort of breezy busyness. “sizzle” follows, operating in a slower mode, making for ideal wind-down dance music. juniper returns on “breathing,” her voice coupled with the kind of pointillist sounds and piano riffs that wouldn’t sound out of place on a composition by philip glass. the devotion to variety continues as expands, journeying through swells of day-glo bass music (“we’ve been”) and stately lounge (“shuffle home”). juniper reappears to sing in three more songs, but robinson’s tracks, with their rubbery percussive feel and eloquently specific drum sounds, talk well on their own terms—in a language guided by atmosphere and rhythm more than words. —"
d7748,"telling it like it is marching church one theme of elias bender rønnenfelt’s lyricism and attendant imagery, throughout his varying projects (which also include iceage, pagan youth and vår), is a sense of bacchanalian splendor, a fixation on boozy glamor and the residual grime revealed by the light of dawn. it’s a familiar theme, with many pitfalls—the proclamations of grandeur that register as uncomfortably un-ironic, the florid raving, the way , on 2015’s mistook ensemble incoherence for liberated improvisation. however, finds rønnenfelt and a cast of players focused and relatively toned down, having perhaps realized that sleazy nuance and shifty restraint is the best way to explore excess. it’s to the credit of the album overall that the supple, featherweight beauty of single “heart of life”—which luxuriates in spare piano and mesh-like percussive texture, exquisitely denying an expected climax—doesn’t outshine the other eight songs. marching church is a big band here, with about a dozen players on the record (including, crucially, lower’s remarkably poised rhythm section), but it sounds like a small one: viola and saxophone, trumpet and flute—they’re garnish and zest, emphasizing and at the right times undercutting rønnenfelt’s stagy delivery. a legible and resonant metaphor, “inner city pigeon” finds rønnenfelt observant yet detached from urbanites, coasting past windows and “never coming down.” the song, with its atmosphere of velvety murk, makes potent that sense of debauched estrangement that stalks his catalog. feel how the woozy bass and sagging toms approximate listless, weary flight. that is, until a cymbal bell and skittering, discordant strings sound alarm. it’s a signal, listeners might gather, that when crashing feels impossible, it’s actually inevitable."

(despite being born in new brunswick and living in canada, sharma sounds impressively british throughout). every song on is immaculately constructed; big, pealing guitars kick out unapologetically melodic leads, basslines roam anxiously among thumping percussion, sharma seethes and sneers; every element joins forces for soaring, choruses. all of this sounds like a series of backhanded compliments, but it’s not: stuns because every element is meticulously arranged to deliver maximum emotional impact. wry verses explode into beaming refrains like a bitter cynic suddenly discovering true love. “the unknown” opens with a clarion call of guitar and works its way into a chorus that struts and pouts with confidence. “still, soft” is almost entirely submerged in feedback, but the “doot-doot-doot” refrain bobbles its way cheerily to the top. and “lush” is sewn up in sparkling spiderwebs of guitar, which gorgeously offset sharma’s chiaroscuro vocal. by the end of , sharma has found his way out of the city and is walking along the beach, sun coming up, “father, son, and holy ghost” floating above his head. it’s a surprisingly optimistic ending to a record that spends most of its time fusing pop immediacy with emotional distance. needless to say, its chorus is tremendous. — "

d7797,"rays rays the way rays’ debut kicks off, with the warbling, mutated jangle of “attic,” is a perfect scene-setter. it recalls some of the key themes of early post-punk; if punk stripped away all the fuss and pomp of ‘70s rock to its bare essentials and set it at warp speed, post-punk bands drilled further down into the dark core of psychedelia, to all the bad drugs and isolating cults beneath the swirling colors. “attic” is rickety in that same way, with a woozy synth line and eva hannan’s spiraling vocals taking us up there. it brings back the childhood dread of seeing that unstable little ladder pop down from the ceiling at a relative’s house: this is the territory that rays explore—though you shouldn’t expect any of those secrets to be made explicit over the course of these 11 songs. where punk can be didactic, post-punk works best with lyrical bones, letting the listeners, like forensic specialists, follow the story back themselves through clues that might not seem obvious at first. rays, of course, know punk and post-punk so intimately these tropes are second nature to them: hannan, stanley martinez, alexa pantalone and troy hewitt have been/are in more excellent bands than one can count (pang, the world, , life stinks, and so forth), and they genuinely sound like they’re having a good time with one another here. that’s especially evident when they’re working with the existential dread of everyday life, as on “attic”; other tracks in that vein, like “drop dead” and “pain and sorrow,” sound positively ebullient in much the manner of the best fall songs, curdled with wicked delight. master engineer mikey young (of , , etc.) brings this quality out perfectly; the album sounds, essentially, like a well-recorded live performance, rather than an airless studio artifact. rays’ debut is, thus, a very good document of a very good band, and its restraint is part of what makes it special. this isn’t a band that could come out of the gate hard; these songs work so well because they hang together so laconically, belying the tension beneath. if they went full bore, they’d fall apart. these songs’ subtle construction and delicate equilibrium are necessary."

d7800,"soul run tanika charles r&b/soul, soul , the debut lp from canada’s rising soul star tanika charles, is ostensibly a breakup album. but these songs are so exuberant, and charles’ voice is so defiant and confident, that it hardly registers that way. charles’ 2010 ep demonstrated that the edmonton singer wasn’t content to stay within the parameters of retro soul—the g-funk-influenced “parkdale,” in particular, demonstrated her eagerness to cover fresh ground—and continues that imaginative streak, yet often in subtler ways. charles constructed these songs with a series of producers, including the drake collaborator slakah the beatchild, and as a result presents itself as a grab-bag of surprises. the short “intro,” with its modulated voices and effects, provides a thrilling launch pad into the thumping title track, while “two steps” leans on an unexpected and glimmering afrobeat guitar riff. both “endless chain” and “money” evoke vintage muscle shoals recordings, but with an emphasis on precise and booming percussion that keeps them fresh and modern. these varied styles give charles different contexts to experiment with her vocal gymnastics. throughout the album, she pays homage to legends like aretha franklin and etta james—on “sweet memories,” she does an uncanny take on the jackson 5’s shrill howls—but she’s got a sense of spunk that’s all her own. from start to finish, serves up one kiss-off after another to charles’ ex. at one point she insists that she “don’t need a man to walk me home,” and by the album’s conclusion she declares, definitively, “i won’t be back.” but because she manages to channel her angst in a way that sounds more playful than bitter or mournful, tanika charles makes it clear that she’s moving forward. we can’t help but want to follow along. —"

d7815,"arry grenadie jack dejohnette jazz the members of the jazz supergroup hudson share a language created in cities: by dense hive-minds of musicians, the spaces where they cross-pollinate, and audiences who amplify the buzz. but as with many people who grow older, the four members of the group eventually moved out of town—in this case, up the hudson river north of new york city. that happy accident of mutual proximity, and master drummer jack dejohnette’s 75th birthday, spurred this new project, which also features john medeski (keyboard instruments), larry grenadier (bass) and john scofield (guitar). they form a multi-generational crew of improvisers, particularly noted for working at the nexus of jazz, funk, and rock. (see: medeski martin and wood, or miles davis c. 1969, or the bulk of scofield’s discography.) yet their first album isn’t an overt fusion of a style x + style y. their mergers are more subtle, gestures from musicians who have lived through a lot, and who now freely supplement their common dialect at their own leisure and discretion. about half of is original compositions, with the remainder written by folk and rock musicians connected to their home region: bob dylan, joni mitchell, jimi hendrix, and levon helm of the band. the latter portion is read with a deceptive cleanliness, with scofield clearly stating melody lines; at times, hudson comes close to being a rather overqualified instrumental cover band. sensing as much, the quartet attempts to match its musical choices with the lyrics of the originals—see the messy apocalyptic breakdown on “a hard rain’s a-gonna fall” or the unsettled wistfulness in “woodstock.” dejohnette takes the vocal mic on the new orleans-inspired mixed-meter shuffle “dirty ground”; his “song for world forgiveness” transforms into a rock ballad. the band sounds more conventional on the hard-bop blues throwdown “tony then jack,” or on the spanish-tinged churn of “el swing.” all this makes their opener a red herring, as the collective, groove-driven improvisation “hudson” suggests this meeting of minds might be a loud, high-intensity jam band. but by their closer, “great spirit peace chant”—literally a group chant, inspired by the native inhabitants of the hudson valley—it’s the range of what they attempt which echoes loudest. —"

d7817,"some twist michael nau alternative, indie rock on last year’s solo debut, , michael nau emerged as a tender and haunting songwriter. his voice was like some dylan phase that never quite came to pass, and he wrote songs that could fold into one’s life with ease, as if they’d always just been there. nau was actually a veteran songwriter by the time of ’s release—he fronted the playful and complex page france and the more melancholy and rootsy cotton jones—but on his first outing under his own name, he stripped away the showier aspects of his writing and presented a startlingly pure, straightforward vision. the songs on had more in common with jazz standards than most of the music being written by nau’s contemporaries. all of which creates significant pressure for nau’s follow-up, . when you’ve stripped your songs down to their sweet and slightly psychedelic essence, where do you go from there? nau’s answer to this question is to broaden his sound while using his lyrics to reflect on the notion of change. successfully expands the sonic palette of without sacrificing its predecessor’s soulful feel. it starts out familiar enough: opener “good thing” is a groovy meditation on nature and pleasure elevated to the realm of the spiritual by some “chariots of fire”-esque piano chords; “i root” is an endearing, big-picture love song that recalls harry nilsson’s “everybody’s talkin.” but later, nau brings in a few less-expected elements, like the distorted breakbeat on the instantly-hummable “how you’re so for real,” the queasy vocal filter on “scatter,” and the sweaty blues guitar licks and skronky saxophone freakouts of “the load.” the record journeys from the expected into the mysterious, but nau is a trustworthy guide who brings melody and humanity to every track. smooth and stoney singer-songwriter dudes abound in the 2010s, and it takes a lot to stand out in a canon that often feels as if it were built for blending in. in nau’s case, the difference is in the songwriting. his songs bear new fruit on each repeated listen: sometimes it’s a half-buried counter-melody, sometimes it’s in a subtle turn of phrase. this is generous, full-hearted music. hardened music fans and critics complain that there’s nothing new under the sun, but true magic happens when a talented songwriter finds something new within michael nau has nailed that trick twice in a row. —"

d7849,"relatives in descent protomartyr punk, post-punk on their first two albums, protomartyr turned a jaundiced eye toward their immediate surroundings, documenting nasty displays of violence—both interpersonal and systemic—that cropped up throughout their home city of detroit. on their third album, , they expanded their scope, trying to dig up the of that violence in religion, philosophy, and biology. on , their focus has become even more diffuse. early in the haunting opener “a private understanding,” frontman and lyricist joe casey declares: “not by my own hand / automatic writing by phantom limb,” and much of seems to follow that m.o. gone are the “hawks ripping out liars’ eyes” and “dogs eating their young.” in its place is language that’s looser and even more stream-of-consciousness. the grinding “here is the thing” feels like a bleak madlib of contemporary catastrophes, casey itemizing, “new face loves surveillance, comic sans, parroting an ape” as the band kicks and grunts behind him. on the tumbling “the chuckler” casey balefully sings, “war and rumors of war / clouds of poison in the sky and poison in the soil,” before delivering the kicker: “lord, how i wish there was a better ending to this joke.” the pensive “up the tower” condenses the album’s entire thematic thrust into one microcosm: it begins with casey sharing a cigarette with a man on a corner, but as the song goes on, the lens widens: protesters burst through police blockades and storm a mansion until they reach “the golden door”—the entire song shifting from the personal to the political to, arguably, the theological in the space of 90 seconds. throughout , the band scales outward to match the lyrics’ wide grasp. on their first two albums, they felt feral and unglued, but on they began softening the edges of their sound. they continue that expansion on to spectacular effect. the opening of “my children” is chilling in its spareness, just a few icicle-like guitars from greg ahee dripping slowly in the background as bassist scott davidson and drummer alex leonard stalk the song’s edges. even when it gains speed, it still feels open and harrowing, ahee preferring bent-wire post-punk leads over brick-like riffing. “night-blooming cereus” is the closest thing to a ballad the band has written yet, floating along on an eerily-serene synth line, ahee’s guitar appearing only in lightning-flashes. casey has grown exponentially as a vocalist in the short five years since ; for much of he adopts a kind of weather-beaten croon, all the better to serve the band’s increasing fondness for empty spaces. if protomartyr have a clear antecedent, it’s the fall, another band who paired knotty guitar work with declamatory vocals and lyrics that are, by turn, cutting and obscure. but where the fall seemed content to submerge themselves in the acid of cynicism, protomartyr have always looked for opportunities to come up for air. at the end of “the chuckler,” casey seeks solace in a phone call with “a direct-marketer from bangalore.” they talk about life and the weather and the fact that the person on the other end of the phone shares a name with a friend of casey’s. it’s a small detail, but on an album preoccupied with global ruin, it also offers a few seconds of hope. even now, in an age lit by burning cities, surviving on polluted water and expired food, human connection—even between a rock singer and a customer service representative—is still possible. all you have to do is want it badly enough. —"
d7850,"joli mai daphni electronic, house, techno is there a way to make a musical virtue of understated ecstasy? that’s the question that daphni, the dance music-minded alias of caribou’s dan snaith, seems to be asking. while his main outfit has evolved from a post-rock project to a more electronically-inclined enterprise over the years, snaith’s work as daphni has set its sights expressly toward the dancefloor, with a particular allegiance to house music and its soulful variants in their most organic forms. like four tet, a close friend and collaborator who established himself as a dance music master only after loosening up slowly, over the course of several years, snaith’s earliest certifiable “club music” tracks had an uptightness and uprightness that have faded away. the result has been transformative, largely because the new songs exhibit a true ability to swing—to play around more freely with syncopation and entertain genre expectations that can just as easily be upended. is related to daphni’s recent dj-mix release , for which snaith created a new array of original tracks and edits to twist together into a tightly coiled sequence over an extended 74-minute spell. presents tracks from that mix in longer versions—plus the unreleased “vulture,” which has been passed around only by way of some of daphni’s dj friends. the other 11 tracks were conceived to serve their respective purposes in particular spots of the mix, meaning that changes in speed and tweaks in volume (and so on) were integral to their duties as part of a mosaic whole. those functional, purpose-minded aspects of the tracks are left intact to thrilling effect on so much so that a listener can practically hear daphni thinking out loud about the subtle shifts and mutations a dj considers over the course of a set. “poly” opens with a swell of synth arpeggios and cooing vocal snips that build before “face to face” comes on strong with drums and a bassline pared down to its essence. adjustments in volume and dynamics abound over the course of five-plus minutes that grow funkier for all their little variations. other tracks fluctuate in weight, and swing between big drama (“xing tian”) and small, slice-of-life sentiment (“life’s what you make it”). each plays its own adopted role in a collection that designates daphni as a dance music producer at the top of the field. —"

d7862,"any other way jackie shane r&b/soul when practically every song in existence sits somewhere on the internet, it’s difficult to discover a truly significant—but largely unknown—talent with a barely-heard body of work that fully testifies to their greatness: there’s got be a really profound reason, or a bunch of them, for their obscurity. jackie shane is such a find. born and now living in nashville, but a bona fide star in 1960s toronto, shane sang soul as if her life depended on it—because . not only is she an african-american who barely escaped the jim crow south, shane also pioneered a transgender identity when few civilized words existed for a woman like her. more than 50 years after her heyday, it still takes major chops and charisma to overcome racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia, so you can imagine what it took for shane to pack toronto clubs week after week and land a major, long-lasting regional r&b hit on top 40 radio—particularly when the population was almost all white. that transcendent force is all over her first comprehensive retrospective. featuring every one of her collectable single sides from the ‘60s and the entirety of her rare 1967 live album plus bonus outtakes, is a remarkable document from a sociological perspective, but just as impressive from a musical one. clearly schooled in gospel, as well as her era’s southern soul icons, shane sings with a rasp that’s akin to sam cooke or james brown. yet her equally exceptional stage patter is a one-of-a-kind cross of baptist preacher and lgbtq pathfinder—sassy, a tad mischievous, but also self-possessed. the fact that she served up both in stunning silk suits with bouffant hair and fully feminine makeup throughout the ‘60s when a transwoman like her could get arrested for merely walking down the street is mind-blowing. her confidence is as staggering as her ability. both land bracingly hard on the introductory cut, “sticks and stones,” the b-side to her late 1962 debut single. “i’ve been abused / deep down in my ,” she belts in this breakneck rendition of the soul standard, then recently popularized by ray charles. it’s one of several tracks that testify to the lgbtq experience through borrowed material, and the way shane sings it leaves no doubt she’s suffered profoundly. yet she also radiates a toughness that suggests shane’s not to be troubled by any trifling words that might come her way. and the rest of the arrangement similarly exudes defiance—check that positively giddy piano break: if it were any faster, those speedy notes would blur into chords. “tell her that i’m happy, tell her that i’m gay / tell her i wouldn’t have it any other way,” she croons in her definitive interpretation of william bell’s “any other way.” this was her toronto smash, a number-two sensation on chum, the city’s reigning pop station; a breakout hit in several u.s. cities, and an enduring cult favorite across canada that prompted a 1967 re-release. even then, the present-day understanding of “gay” was employed almost exclusively by homosexuals—it was inside code, not common vernacular. as smooth here as she’s sharp elsewhere, shane delivers her declaration with an easy assurance that crosses every kind of cultural divide. her worldly monologues documented on the “live” section of the album are even more daring for the repeated use of the word “chicken,” which is gay slang for young men. she talks about “my woman” to satisfy the straight crowd who likely saw her as a man in makeup, but also speaks freely of her fondness for “chicken” so that her own people knew exactly what’s up. shane was the featured attraction in frank motley and the hitchhikers, a toronto-based live band led by a trumpeter who played two horns simultaneously. like some of her singles, they’re coarser than she is, but their roughness only highlights her magnetism. sighing sweetly one moment, screaming righteously the next, shane gives herself gospel-style—completely—in every song as if willing herself to a promised land right here on earth. “i’m not gonna let you get me down ‘cause i got too much on the ball,” she announces on “stand up straight and tall.” only the foolhardy would try. —"

d7867,"trans-millenia music pauline anna strom ambient, electronic despite the adage, there times when you can judge an album by looking at its cover. a prime example is the first album from the mysterious san francisco composer pauline anna strom. it features a rainbow-framed mandala with a blue sky, and in the center is a cracked egg with a magritte-like eyeball staring back at you. it suggests a sound created far above earth, surreal and heaven-bound. the uncanny synthesizer music contained within fully delivers on that promise. released in an extremely limited edition back in 1982, seemed to vanish immediately, fetching astronomical sums online. six other lps and cassettes followed throughout the decade in even smaller editions before strom disappeared altogether. outside of a few fervent fans—like mgmt and legowelt—it seemed like her music was going to be lost to time. now, the rvng label presents an exquisite portrait of the enigmatic composer. this compilation contains four compositions from that album, as well as an array of tracks from her other albums. it’s an 80-minute collection that spans her work from 1982 to 1988, and it’s a psychedelic trip that elegantly dances between light and dark, ancient and futuristic. most importantly, it casts much-needed light on the nearly forgotten composer. born premature in louisiana, an excess of oxygen caused complete optic nerve damage to the infant strom, resulting in permanent blindness. as a child, she was drawn both to classical music as well as tales of ancient egypt. she got caught up in the flower power of the ’60s and relocated to san francisco’s tenderloin district, where she’s lived since 1968. in the early ‘70s, she was taken in by the synthesized soundscapes broadcast by the hearts of space radio show in berkeley, which introduced her to the likes of tangerine dream, kitarō, brian eno, and strom’s favorite, klaus schulze. inspired, she began to explore music on her own in the wee hours of the night. the spirit of schulze moves through her own music but, as proves, strom was a visionary in her own right. she may have been making synthesizer music in san fran during the rise of new age music in the early ‘80s, but her art slips outside of such easy categorization. it can feel relaxing and anxious at once. “in flight suspension” is as weightless as its title suggests, with quivering tones swooping down from across the stereo field, high frequencies sparkling at the edges. “spatial spectre” is a precursor to dark ambient, full of foreboding and tones liable to prickle your skin. inversely, the giddy arpeggios of “morning splendor” are as magical and hushed as watching the first rays of a new day beaming over the horizon. it’s a perfect example of how strom’s evocative touch on electronic keys conjures something warm and pastoral. —"

(the dogmatic positivity in the spoken word passages of “doings,” “dimples,” “almost doomed,” and “doomed” wryly underscore the album’s main thrust.) there are moments of respite—like “pipe dream,” a rare quiet track full of blips and tones—but they don’t last long. the record ends with the violence of “breaking up,” a track that recalls the screaming chorus of “embowelment,” with its fury laser-focused on a cheating lover. balanced atop a plucking, tuneless guitar, the track quickly devolves into instability. is de jong in an even more fearless form, with nothing to lose but darkness, anger, and despair. it’s a record that rewards repeat listeners, and inspires a reevaluation of what it means to use music as a tool for healing."

d7928,"blue poles jack ladder & the dreamlanders alternative with a hint of nick cave in his smoky baritone and a savvy erudition in his lyrics, jack ladder carries himself with the air of a raffish guy making his way through bars, back alleys, and bedrooms with equal aplomb. on his fifth album , ladder and his backing band the dreamlanders deliver songs that are one part dark cabaret and one part roadhouse band, well-suited to ladder’s melancholy crooning. the result is music that’s theatrical, but never melodramatic. the band—which features kirin j callinan on guitar—kick into suave mode on the opening “can’t stay” and sustain that elegant air throughout. the dreamlanders may have the kind of taut swing and stomp that feels built for dancing, but on they capably generate a host of different atmospheres, whether it’s the nervy synth-led “susan” or the slow burn build “tell it like it is.” ladder, acting as his own producer, rides through it all with the ease of a seasoned performer (his first full album was released 13 years ago). he knows what works best, for both him and his musicians. never fully lost in the music, but not roaring over it either, his understated ease lends a narrator’s confidence to his portrayals of people with a desperate nighttime edge about them. there’s a bit of humor too; at the start of “i.n.m,” ladder deadpans, “levitation is easy…if you know how to pull some strings.” is an album of short stories, recounted by an assured, debonair protagonist."
d7929,"exit future heart dustin wong + takako minekawa + good willsmith electronic tokyo-based duo dustin wong and takako minekawa were passing through chicago while on tour last year, and decided to take a few hours to jam with the windy city trio good willsmith (natalie chami—aka —doug kaplan, and maxwell allison); the six tracks that comprise were improvised and recorded during that session. it would have been hard to predict in advance how things would have turned out: both acts tend to approach their mostly-electronic compositions playfully, with wong and minekawa favoring to regular patterns and cute melodies, and good willsmith opting for the abstract, their improvised free-for-alls ping-ponging all over the place, full of delirious mischief. combined, they could have easily amplified one another’s kookier aspects and ended up with something both overstimulated and overstimulating. instead, by some miraculous alchemical reaction, each has brought out the vivid beauty in the other. this is, very simply, a gorgeous record. there are some tangible reference points: a motorik krautrock beat underpinning “the garden of earthly flanger”; some freaky vocal processing in “aiの名” that recalls the post-arca school of contemporary electronica; a particular interaction between the cymbals and high-frequency synths on “擬感情物語” that feels descended from early ‘90s underground resistance and carl craig. here and there, you might hear hints of the necks’ slo-mo jams, or the orb at their best and most intergalactic. but more often, you won’t even notice the lineage, because the sound consistently transcends not only influence, but its own immediate sources: you won’t know whether what you’re hearing is organic or electronic, but it hardly matters, because the result is simply blissful. if you’re spiritually inclined, may transport you to some higher plane of serenity. and if you’re not spiritually inclined, it might just change your mind."
d7930,"quieter carla bozulich experimental carla bozulich, in my estimation, has yet to get the canonical appreciation she deserves. critically adored and certainly renowned among a faithful audience of listeners—many of whom (like myself) have been following her since her days as a member of the industrial group ethyl meatplow and the warped alt-country outfit geraldine fibbers—she still rarely shows up in regular discussions of some of the most unique and consistent voices to emerge from the ‘90s underground, or of the most talented musicians and arrangers in experimental music today. and her work carries great emotional heft and immediacy, too, in a way that heady experimentation often struggles with; it often seems to come from some raw rift in the heart, full of the ugliness of loss and grief and alienation. part of this, surely, is that her music ranges wide across a number of styles but bends them all in to a very specific aesthetic—which can often be harsh and confrontational to the ear (especially when she’s playing with her band evangelista), but does not have any of the pummeling, unrelenting genre conventions of much of the noise scene. she brings in her beloved country music (see her , with nels cline, for this impulse in its purest form), gospel (which, of course, helped birth both country and blues), and sly nods to pop music from the ‘50s through the ‘70s. and though she has such a firm sense of herself and her sonic range, she’s never afraid to explore new territory or to collaborate with real equanimity with any number of fellow musicians. her latest, —a fairly easily approachable record in the bozulich oeuvre, as was her last, —is full of honored guests. john eichenseer, aka , contributes to two of the album’s most striking pieces: the opener “let it roll” (on which another experimental stalwart, , plays drums) and “stained in grace.” “let it roll” is positively spiritual, with duduk and bells conjuring a meditative state that’s both intimate and highly ritualized, as the most meaningful religious services are. joins in on “written in smoke,” creating sharp terrain with caustic guitar work for bozulich’s dreamy growl to explore. the night porter—bozulich’s group with shahzad ismaily, jessica catron, and ches smith—assembles for “sha sha,” a true creepout that stretches, malforms, and grinds up sunny pop idioms with metallic grace. the legendary marc ribot co-wrote “end of the world,” which posits that we’ll go out not with a bang or a whimper but a slow, deadly groan; he also appears on “emilia,” as does cellist , who co-wrote that beautiful, aching piece. hopefully, this gorgeous album, which deserves to have time spent with it in the same way all of bozulich’s work does, will get her one step further to the center of the conversation when it comes to lifetime achievement in the experimental world."
d7931,"mating surfaces lithics punk, post-punk , the sophomore album from post-punk darlings , showcases the four-piece at the height of their powers. jagged guitar riffs, dominant basslines, minimal drums, and affectless vocals work together to create a fresh take on classic post-punk (à la delta 5 or gang of four). newly signed to legendary pacific northwest label kill rock stars, on this release the portland, or-based band deliver 12 biting, crisp tracks in just under 30 minutes. vocalist aubrey hornor, who also plays guitar, delivers her lyrics with confidence, recalling a more polished cynthia sley (of ). hornor’s lyrics, filled with gertrude stein-esque half-thoughts and repetitions, evoke lonely, fractured scenes: “no place to call your own / when you are all alone,” she sings on “home.” although lithics does dissonant, experimental punk well, some of the best tracks dive into distinctly more melodic territory, particularly on the latter half of the album. the sing-song vocals and dueling guitar lines of “edible door” bring to mind in their era. this sonic shift may signal more of what the band has been striving for. in an interview last year, bassist bob desaulniers said he considered their efforts to be more pop-oriented these days. “i’d rather be a kind of harsh pop band than trying to be some badass punk band and not really succeeding at that,” in an interview with portland alt-weekly . whatever stylistic slot you want to put it in, is easily one of the best releases this year."
d7932,"7 beach house alternative when beach house first appeared in 2006 with their self-titled debut, a collection of nine songs built from alex scally’s aching, reverb-drenched guitar lines and victoria legrand’s mystic lyrics and ghostly vocals, they were essentially sketching a blueprint that each subsequent release would both follow and expand on. , in 2010, added romance, melancholy, and lusher melodic elements; 2015’s back-to-back and were more spacious, with pared-down instrumentation leaving plenty of empty air between the notes. their latest album, , is beach house at their most restless, exploring new musical terrain while remaining rooted in their core sound. it’s not a sleight to say that the most exciting songs on distantly resemble older beach house songs. on lead single “lemon glow,” the duo pushes the arena-leaning anthemics of ’s “wishes” into a deep groove, maybe the first straight-up in the band’s catalog. the spastic, jittering synths that introduce “drunk in la” sound ripped from a neon indian song, but ’s eerie sense of sorrow manifests itself in legrand’s slowly unfurling vocals and abstract, devastating lyrics. scally’s use of acoustic guitar on “lose your smile” is unprecedented in beach house’s catalog, but the wail of a slide guitar on the song’s outro recalls the intro of debut single “apple orchard.” “l’inconnue” is partially sung in french, and it’s one of two tracks to boast a mid-song tempo change, but its organ-led, bleak ambience would feel at home on . lyrically, mostly sticks to the group’s established topics: the darker parts of the human mind, the desolate undercurrents of romance. on legrand leans into the lyrical abstractions that have guided her since ; through her words, she pushes beach house even further in the metaphysical direction toward which it’s been heading. present as ever, though, is the haunting, enveloping aura that’s defined the band from day one."
d7933,"i have fought against i the body metal portland-based extreme metal duo have released a dozen albums since their 2010 breakout, . though the band’s sound is easily recognizable, each subsequent release also brings something new to the table, not only because members chip king and lee buford have built their songs more and more around samples and synthesized drums as their project has progressed, but also because they’ve opened their creative doors to countless other musicians. more than half of the body’s releases are full-on collaborations with other bands—like and —and even albums credited to just “the body” include a plurality of voices beyond king’s and buford’s. it’s no surprise, then, that the first voice we hear on the group’s latest, , doesn’t belong to either of the band’s core members but to assembly of light choir’s chrissy wolpert, whose elegiac vocal enters near the end of the quiet, fraying first track. it isn’t until track two, “can carry no weight,” that we hear king’s trademark, razor-like wail; when we do, it’s set in the background of the mix, chopped and manipulated under kristin hayter of ’s lead vocal and anchored by a muted four-on-the-floor beat. this interplay is telling: on , king and buford take on the role of being contemporary metal’s sly & robbie. they focus their energy on rhythm, texture, and structure, sampling their own distinct sound—the booming percussion, in-the-red distortion, king’s voice—such that it becomes a sonic foundation for their collaborators to build upon. this results in frequent, affecting tonal shifts. the first two-thirds of “an urn” display the duo’s varied toolbox: grinding noise, a synthesized beat, abstract howls, a fleeting, dancehall-ish melody line. once they set the stage, hayter comes in, screaming a monologue that, against an stop-start acoustic drumbeat, matches ’s somber register but adds a personalized sense of urgency."

d7935,"location the contemporary jazz quintet jazz, free jazz kenny cox was watching miles davis closely in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. the detroit pianist was hardly alone, of course—but the first two albums by cox’s contemporary jazz quintet (released on blue note in 1968-69) may have picked up the gauntlet of davis’s great ‘60s quintet more firmly than any other jazz band of the time. the quintet’s third album, , didn’t come until 1973—on cox’s own strata records, its inaugural release—and by that time, cox had learned the lessons of and , too. reshaped those lessons, however. bassist ron brooks retains his upright acoustic, replacing aggressive funk with a steady thrum that becomes nearly subliminal beneath cox’s electric piano, trumpeter charles moore and saxophonist leon henderson’s horns, and danny spencer or bud spangler’s percussions. the drummers, too, deviate from davis’s fusion template: they have the longer-distance miking and thudding low-end, but hew closer to conventional swing, even if—as on “nzugo saba (struggle)”—it’s lightning fast. two tracks, “tao” and “inner beckoning,” come closer than the others to funk, featuring guitarist ron english, who strongly echoes john mclaughlin. there are throbbing grooves and some electronic processing of trumpet and bass on “inner beckoning,” though the track is more hesitant in its pacing. the quintet abhors clutter—“tao” keeps to a clean, easy groove, such that even when spangler builds into a trap-kit frenzy, the others mainly just stay out of his way. the resulting rhythmic and textural approach sometimes hints at damo suzuki-era can, a contemporary of the quintet, and one whom cox likely hadn’t then heard. more to the point, though, is a thoughtful, fascinating example of cox as a keen observer of the cutting edge, understanding it before most of the world had caught up—and having the confidence to take it his own way.

d7936,"maghreb united ammar 808 electronic the first few seconds of ammar 808’s are filled by a looped sample of a crackling, distorted voice that sounds like a dispatch from an emergency alert system. eventually, it’s subsumed by the fast-paced cadence of the drums, the deep, thumping bass, and sofiane saidi’s strong but calm vocals. album opener “degdega” seems to be designed to make your heart beat faster, translating the feeling of unease into sound. it’s a fitting introduction to a record full of intense energy—hard to define, but immediately palpable thanks to electronic mastermind sofyann ben youssef’s expertly concocted beats. sounds urgent because it is meant to be. ben youssef uses a tr-808 to reimagine the many traditional rhythms and instruments of the maghreb—an area that spans most of northern africa, from mauritania to libya—through a sci-fi lens in order to warn the region’s dwellers about an impending bleak future, and to spur them into action. by putting instruments like the gasba flute, the zokra bagpipe, and the guembri guitar through the filters of the iconic 808 and bending these sounds into surprising and often unrecognizable forms, ben youssef joins the ranks of artists shedding a light on north african futurism by taking a critical and nuanced look at past traditions and remaking them into something that can serve as a window to the region’s unique heritage for the citizens of a distant future. is a wild, intriguing listen; ben youssef uses harsh electronic beats as a canvas to constantly criss-cross styles and sounds that don’t typically occupy the same space. desert blues rhythms coexist with hard rave beats, algerian raï, targ music from the bargou valley in tunisia, and moroccan gnawa, creating a sound that’s as raucous as it is alluring and illuminating. the standout track “layli” is a testament as to how all these influences work together. beginning with a distorted guitar riff, it quickly evolves into an upbeat banger, with hand percussion and distant chiptune blips accompanying renowned moroccan guembri player and singer mehdi nassouli’s game of call and response with the backing choir. after a dizzying break, the track turns into a gabber-influenced banger with an undeniably youthful energy. these juxtapositions between toughness and playfulness run throughout the record with a track like “ichki lel bey” featuring chiptune breaks, and another like “boganga and sandia” featuring a beautiful guembri melody looped and layered on top of a resounding bass. using north african futurism as an outstanding tool, ben youssef digs into the maghreb’s past and present to show the harmony within the differences, and the surprising ways the region can launch traditional maghrebi culture into the future."
d7937,"happy ending wax idols alternative oakland’s wax idols started as the vision of its founder, singer/guitarist hether fortune, but on their fourth album, , the quartet’s power is as a collective force. thanks to now long-established members rachel travers on drums and peter lightning on guitar, wax idols have done something other bands similarly indebted to ‘80s post-punk and goth haven’t: write a record that finds strength in simply being alive, however dark the shadows might be. it’s audible from the start, with the lead-off track “heaven knows” smartly showcasing nearly all the group’s core qualities. fortune’s vivid, strong voice matches instantly memorable music that combines pop catchiness with dark undertones, squealing and shattered guitar riffs with tense, powerful drumming. the following track, “too late,” soars like something out of the psychedelic furs catalog; while its lyrics speak of loss, the song itself pushes forward relentlessly, mirroring the album’s spirit of determination. “belong,” built around a bass riff by travers and fleshed out by the band, has the nerviness of a prime cure single, a tangle of guitars tripping across a locomotive bassline. in recent , fortune has spoken about weathering deep, personal losses and, accordingly, the lyrics on address separation, regret, and despair. the album’s closing song, “missed call,” is a spare fortune solo performance that speaks of missed connections and sad farewells. but as the song goes on, it becomes about something more—fortune begins recalling shared memories with an unnamed friend on the other end of a phone call. “i don’t blame you for anything,” she sings, “some people they just drift away never knowing that they’re lost.” it mirrors much of : life is difficult, painful things happen but, ultimately, peace is possible."
d7938,"tell me how you really feel courtney barnett alternative on her debut lp, 2015’s , australian singer-songwriter courtney barnett proved herself to be a master of turning everyday observations into smart, relatable truths. the album was full of colorful lyrics about rebelling against the 9-to-5, staying home from the party, and the mirage of domestic bliss, all delivered in barnett’s trademark chill drawl. “now we’ve got that percolator / never made a latte greater / i’m saving 23 dollars a week,” she sings on “depreston,” one of the record’s many standout tracks. now, countless tours, one kurt vile collab album, and a lifetime of socio-political turmoil later, barnett’s latest, , seems to build on that foundation while heaping the weight of the last three years on its maker’s shoulders. the record opens with “hopefulessness,” a slow-building number that plainly lays out her thesis statement: “take your broken heart / turn it into art,” she sings as her guitar grows more insistent. that song ends with the screech of a kettle whistle and, in a lot of ways, is the sound of barnett reaching her boiling point. on “nameless, faceless,” barnett echoes the #metoo movement, loosely adapting the margaret atwood quote “men are scared that women will laugh at them / women are scared that men will kill them” around a line about how barnett walks through the park at night while holding her keys between her fingers. it’s followed by the feedback-filled “i’m not your mother, i’m not your bitch,” in which barnett channels her inner karen o to wail that she can “only put up with so much shit.” ultimately, though, it’s the way barnett juxtaposes these moments of colossal rage that makes so monumental. “need a little time” offers a refreshingly honest look at intimacy and self-doubt. “help your self” delivers a message of hopeful empowerment almost in spite of itself. and then there’s the sprawling album closer “sunday roast,” which feels most akin to her work with vile, and features what is maybe the record’s most poignant line. “some kindness goes around / some kind of backfires,” barnett sings, revealing just how revelatory simple goodness can be—especially when it feels like the world is crumbling around you."
d7939,"argonauta aisha burns folk an argonauta, the tiny horned octopus from which the singer and violinist aisha burns’s sophomore album takes its name, is a bittersweet symbol of independence; the offsprings remain cradled by their mother until they’re released to swim alone through the open ocean. like a young argonauta, burns herself is caught in “a strange chasm in my life,” as she says in the album notes, and finds her grappling with the loss of her mother while, at the same time, she discovers true love. the album’s brilliance stems from her ability to navigate these two emotional poles with grace, highlighting the strange ways in which grief can manifest itself. burns, originally from austin and now living outside of boston, released her first album, , in 2013. the arrangements were spare, leaving plenty of room for her voice to exert control, winding and soaring with ease. yet takes her vocal prowess to a new level—more confident and operatic. she evokes thom yorke’s plaintive cry on standout tracks like “i thought i knew you well” and “would you come to me”; occasionally, she delivers the album’s most poignant messages with an air of almost stately detachment, bringing to mind the german cult singer nico, acting as a foil for the rich string arrangements, equally cinematic and mournful, that share space with her cutting acoustic guitar. burns’s songs don’t follow conventional structures, and their open-ended nature reflects her tendency to ask more questions than give answers. “oh, won’t some otherworldly joy / please step on in?” she pleads in one of the album’s most climactic moments, on closing track “where do i begin.” steeped in pain, it’s hard to not also hear, in the line, burns’s sheer awe of the world around her."

d7941,"the long sleep jenny hval experimental, folk at the 2:20 mark of ’s opening track, “spells,” jenny hval’s voice rises from an otherwise calm, steady jazz-pop base. the simple swing of the music recalls era or david bowie’s “absolute beginners.” “you will not be awake for long / you won’t have to wait for long,” sings hval, initiating a subtle yet anthemic refrain that repeats throughout the track, sometimes mutating with respect to pronoun (“you” vs. “we”) and whether her voice is single or multi-tracked. like “absolute beginners,” “spells” ends up feeling both triumphant and intimate, both timeless and, in its rhythmic consistency, endless. hval doubles this sense of endlessness, too, by having her refrain pour over into the second song of the ep. there, her now-familiar vocal line serves as a hinge between two distinct compositional segments (a sparse piano ballad and a jittering mass of vocals), facilitating a conversation between them. conversation has long been central to hval’s music. many of her songs stage actual or imagined dialogues between human characters or broader entities. yet where previous hval releases, such as 2016’s , employ direct modes of address—loaded language, narrative specificity, audio-visual doubling— presents conversations that, like the music itself, are a little more spaced out and abstract. there are “you”s and “me”s, but the nature of their relationships tends to drift into the atmosphere, like hval’s soaring voice on “spells.” they exist—to use a lyric from that song—“in the smallest great unknown.” on the short, spoken final track, hval appears to analyze her own songwriting approach: “there is nothing useful in the way we define you or me in this context,” she says, later adding, “it’s not in the words.” indeed, the interactions throughout the ep are open-ended, staged within the recordings—the multi-tracked vocals, track two’s sparring ideas—rather than in the text. the ep’s nearly 11-minute title track removes language altogether. its few vocalizations are quiet, wordless, fragmented, floating in a formless and diverse stream of sound: the most palpable aural manifestation of that “great unknown.”"

d7947,"roach goin’ down palberta alternative palberta’s scruffy punk songs have such a sense of unvarnished hospitality that it can sound like the band is playing them in a room just for you. the new york trio’s fourth album, , builds on the off-the-cuff humor that populated their first three, piling on sung/screamed lyrics and sour guitar chords with an irreverent glee. it’s the longest record they’ve ever released, and also their most considered—for the first time, palberta actually edited their songs after laying them to tape. but that doesn’t diminish the feeling of immediacy that has become the group’s trademark. the three women of palberta—ani ivry-block, lily konigsberg, and nina ryser—all sing, often at once, on the band’s songs, which reinforces the impression of a tight-knit group of friends hanging out and goofing off. despite the surface levity, several tracks on the record weave in a little darkness. “who are you when you have nothing?” they sing on “jaws’ return”; on the slow, nearly mournful “momentous space-up,” they bemoan “having a dream drop.” but the album’s most addictive songs tend to be the ones where the tempo and the snark run high. “sound of the beat,” with its repeated “heys!” and drifting guitar lines, somehow lands in the exact middle between the go-go’s “we got the beat” and the theme song, while album closer “heaven to rock n’ roll” pokes fun at the artifice of palberta’s technical status as a rock group. “satellite! / coming from the heavens of rock ‘n’ roll!” they yelp over a jagged bassline, simultaneously highlighting the silliness of their dude-dominated genre and establishing them as part of it. rock, after all, tends to be best when it’s loose and fun, not overly polished or fixated on virtuosity. by leaving the seams of their sound exposed, palberta make music that’s as inviting as it is invigorating."
d7948,"1+1=x various artists experimental, contemporary classical, electronic with 10 full years of operation under their belt, , the label known for their beautiful releases that often join contemporary composition with experimental electronics and ambient textures, has been celebrating for a full year, and is one of the fine results. while compilations are nothing new for erased tapes, this release is more of a collaboration than a simple collection of unrelated tracks. contributing artists recorded their songs in berlin’s analog vox-ton studio, sharing space and instruments, which makes for exciting cross-pollination. erased tapes is known for housing brilliant piano-based artists, and this album makes a lovely introduction to them. whether it’s ’s hypnotic thrum, dustin o’halloran’s crisp chords (with “a winged victory for the sullen”), or ’s felt-muffled ballads, there are many testimonies to the new potential of this old instrument. the electronica of erased tapes is clean and complex, sharing more attributes with contemporary classical music than with techno. (also of ) opens the album with “brutal moderna.” the song was recorded after the u.s. presidential election in 2016, and features stuttering out the day’s headlines on top of naqvi’s beats and synths. ’ “ritual song” alternates hesitation and dramatic quickening to great effect. ’s “inori” delivers the most avant-garde track of the lot, complete with breathing, operatic vocals, and seagull cries. noit is one of two credited women on the 20 tracks here, mirroring the roster as a whole. (heather woods broderick contributes vocals to brother peter broderick’s song but isn’t credited in the track listing.) especially given the label’s commitment to innovation and collaboration, some gender diversity would be welcome fuel for the next 10 years. label owner robert raths produced the compilation, and in turn it reflects his original vision well. the 20 tracks on were recorded just as immaculately as they were composed, preserving each artist’s work while celebrating the magic that happens when musicians come together."
d7949,"desolation khemmis metal slick and lightly proggy, khemmis’ big, pounding take on doom shares more with traditional heavy metal à la iron maiden than it does with sadder, slower, and similarly-hyped superstars like pallbearer. their third album, , bears a passing resemblance to a host of like-minded outfits—among them, candlemass, baroness, manowar, procession, and kylesa—but it spikes the mix with occasional blackened metal growls. on , khemmis sound tighter than ever, courtesy of the improved and searing solos, and a stronger integration of aggressive vocals alongside clean and soaring ones. second track “isolation” opens with a galloping assault, and its vocal hooks are built for singalongs; the guitars weave their way down wildly varying yet occasionally intertwining paths. “how could i pray for salvation / when i’m the only mourner yet to grieve?” hardly sounds fun on paper, but shouted along, it becomes surprisingly exultant. “flesh to nothing” ascends to grand heights with heavily-layered vocals that alternate between growled and triumphant, peaking with a massive solo after a slow-building tremolo section. the growled vocals do occasionally misfire—“maw of time” is somewhat grating—but the integration is far stronger here than it was on their two previous records. ends on a subdued note with the mournful, nine-and-a-half minute “from ruin,” the most straightforward epic-doom song of the lot. it’s clear why khemmis have become metal’s next underground superstars. is a big, slick, fun record, with endless hooks and songs that are bombastic, compelling, and straight-out fun."

d7952,"divine weight alex zhang hungtai ambient in 2014, alex zhang hungtai with an emotionally heavy final chapter, switching from dirty, lo-fi pop to expansive epics heavy on spiritual saxophone and viola. in the four years that followed, he’s split his time between working as a , and working out his demons over intimate keyboard arrangements. brings the two zhangs together, digitally reworking “failed” (in his own words) saxophone compositions into brooding oceanic ambience that’s been processed out of recognition. opening track “pierrot” scatters mournful notes from the man’s horn into a cavernous echo chamber, while lonely piano chords bristle underneath. it’s a compelling facade, zhang playing up his role as the lonely sufferer namechecked in the track’s title, splitting his turmoil into scattered sax. elsewhere on the record, zhang moves even more slowly, recalling popol vuh at their keyboard choir peak. zhang has been performing under his own name for four years now, and the music he’s created feels more honest; spiritual panic is now firmly at the core of zhang’s solo work. his own mixed background—coming in some way from canada, taiwan, and the u.s. all at once—has already been a key driver for the artist, but a few years of traveling the world and improvising with new instrumentation now make it seem as if he’s left planet earth behind altogether. the celestial scope hinted at in the album’s title fully emerges during the vast 20-minute title track that closes the album, a monstrous cavalcade of overlapping organs. more than anything alex zhang hungtai has done before, this is narcotic music. better yet, it’s music."

d7954,"how many times have you driven by hana vu alternative it can be a gamble for any emerging artist to not commit themselves to an easily-identifiable genre. yet on her first release for a label, , the 18-year-old, self-produced los angeles musician hana vu throws caution to the wind, dipping her toes into murky r&b in the vein of king krule (“cool”), woozy jangle-pop (“426”), and even writing one of the best post-rock gloom jams this side of interpol’s (“shallow”). threaded through the entire project is vu’s remarkable knack for melody; armed with a dazzlingly confident voice, these songs are all clearly , even if they explore radically different musical territory. not only is vu assured, but she tackles questions of self-reliance and emotional insularity with a maturity far beyond that of your average high school student. there are nods to dissolving romance; on “crying on the subway” (perhaps the first song to be written about l.a. public transit) for instance, she captures the complex push and pull of ending a doomed relationship, incorporating a slinking bassline and skittish drum machines that magnify the poles of her mixed emotions. later, on the ep’s title track, she delivers a bold statement of her own independence, backed by nothing but a gravelly guitar figure: “i ran the world / i’ve heard it all / doesn’t get me very far.” even though hana vu seems like she’d rather stay within the confines of her room, she’s made clear that she’s eager to tackle a world’s worth of sounds and experiences."
d7955,"no trail and other unholy paths jaye jayle alternative guitarist/vocalist evan patterson originally formed jaye jayle as a minimalist, solo antidote to his main band, the bone-crushing louisville post-hardcore act young widows. now a quartet augmented by bass, drums, and keyboards, patterson’s group currently hews closer to the shades-tightly-drawn cinematic stylings of nick cave and mark lanegan. produced by david lynch’s long-time music supervisor, dean hurley, jaye jayle’s latest full-length, starts with an instrumental aperitif: “no trail (path one)” is driven by overlapping piano (and, later, keyboard) ostinatos that tumble together as if in a clothes dryer. up next is the hypnotic, dirge-like “no trail (path two).” this song introduces patterson’s baritone, as stark as spilled black ink pooling on paper, before emma ruth rundle joins in to add even more shade to the vocal fray. “what took you so long?” she whispers, in a tone that’s both conspiratorial and frightened. the rest of follows the same blueprint of mesmerizing unease. minor-key guitars add macabre heft to insistent rhythmic pulses, shirred keyboard grooves, and scattered instrumental atmosphere. the clattering backdrop of “ode to betsy” echoes that of bauhaus’ “bela lugosi’s dead”; “low again street” is bookended by foggy, diffracted saxophone; and “as soon as night” boasts recurring whirring sounds that resemble a power drill. the album’s emotional and musical highlight, however, is the tension-filled “marry us.” another example of fine vocal interplay between patterson and rundle, who are a couple in real life, it’s a searing psychedelic sprawl with well-placed percussion (i.e., raindrop-like beats, devious tambourine shakes) and lyrics smoldering with desire. “marry us / we don’t need anyone / we don’t need family / just marry us, now,” patterson demands. the desperation in his voice increases as he urges that the deed be done “quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly”—words spoken just as loud, crashing guitars surge, as if they’re placing a firm exclamation mark on his exhortation. as this song underscores, is a bold step forward for jaye jayle, an album that sears the heart without even trying."
d7956,"future me hates me the beths alternative, indie few bands make angst sound as joyous as the beths do on their debut lp. as its title suggests, the album is full of songs of both regret and self-doubt, but the group deliver them with some of the strongest power-pop this side of weezer’s . the new zealand quartet—who studied jazz together in auckland—have a penchant for writing massive choruses that crash like tidal waves, and their songs are as tightly-wrought as they are relentless. on the belligerent breakup track “uptown girl,” frontwoman elizabeth stokes calls down the wrath of the gods (and a glass of poisoned wine) on a crummy ex as her band yank her from one full-octane hook to another, emphasizing her own frenzied urge to “drink the whole town dry.” later, in “you wouldn’t like me,” a sunny doo-wop arrangement and crisp backup vocals serve as a foil for stokes’s harshest self-indictment: “you wouldn’t like me if you saw what was inside me.” but isn’t all doom and gloom. stokes knows that falling in love is a gamble, and on the album’s title track in particular, she acknowledges that it’s better to have loved and lost than to be, as she deftly puts it, “happy unhappy.” the beths know how to dig up both the wounds and the sugar-rush that accompany new romance; on their debut they do so with exceptional gusto."
d7957,"disambiguation cruel diagonals ambient, dark ambient if isn’t the gothic ambient album of the summer, it’s certainly the ideal soundtrack for sunbathing alone on a float at an abandoned community pool. the debut studio lp from —aka oakland, california’s megan mitchell—spins operatic whirlpools of sound into oceans of whispery drones. urgency is in very short supply here; the predominant vibe here is drift. at times, it can be difficult to understand what mitchell is actually ; her diction is often overcome by feeling, and her malleable voice is one among many of the album’s sonic colors. on “malaise vague,” her voice is brought to the fore. the instrumental itself is drawn back and minimized, and there’s a sadness to her tone that feels like enya in mourning. “soporific return,” by contrast, is lighter, with mitchell’s languorous enunciations swimming through echoing, bell-like electronics. the tremulous “to ward” is a vigorous remix or two away from being something that could fit comfortably on a playlist alongside ’s an immersive, trippy album in its own right. standout “render arcane” is buoyed by a fleet, intricate percussive matrix that nudges , however briefly, towards the world of house music, suggesting one avenue the project could take in the future. another possibility turns up on album closer “intent to vacate,” where the backdrop darkens into something rhythmic, monstrous, and groaning, while mitchell’s voice, strident and strong, pulls away. what that voice has to say, in the album’s closing seconds, is unmistakable: “i give myself / it isn’t enough / submission by omission.”"
d7958,"dissolvi steve hauschildt electronic in the nearly six years since , co-founder steve hauschildt has charted his own course with melancholic and moving electronic music inspired by everything from the industrial rot of the rust belt ( ) to the trappings of technology and the muses that support the arts and sciences in greek mythology ( ). now part of the camp after a long and fruitful run on , the cleveland native/recent chicago transplant has named his fifth solo lp after the latin phrase . for anyone who didn’t study a long-dead language, that means “i wish to be dissolved.” don’t worry, though; is not an egghead exercise about erasing one’s ego. it’s a deeply immersive trip through space and time, alternating between gleaming minimal techno grooves, muffled ambient melodies, and traces of boards of canada and autechre throughout its eight restless tracks. several abstract singers ( , ) bring a welcome more-human-than-human element to “saccade” and “syncope,” leaving a trail of clues as to what’s going on here. something about a surveillance state and a faceless crowd of well-intentioned fools? whatever the case, this record is hauschildt’s most fully realized vision yet, a dream state that simply asks you to tap into its extraterrestrial overtones and drift away."

d7961,"catching a body hprizm hip-hop/rap ever since the bomb squad lobbed their first sonic grenades back in the mid ‘80s, building beats designed not to move the body, but rattle the nerves has proven to be powerful creative ground. that notion of art-damaged anxiety hit its peak during the underground boom of the late ‘90s and early ‘00s—an era in which kyle austin, then known as high priest, first appeared, serving panic as a member of antipop consortium. in the years since, he’s gone from rapping on and co-producing antipop’s glitch-jazz masterpieces to making his own mutant bangers—most notably on his unfairly slept-on solo release, throughout, his work has taken the possibilities of hip-hop composition to their limits, seeming to push a little further each time. over the last few years, his instrumental work under the name hprizm has re-staked his claim to the abstract, cosmic beats that artists like shabazz palaces and flying lotus have re-popularized—afrofuturism that puts chronology and genre development on a mobius strip. continues a thread first stitched on 2014’s ep, fusing period-piece beats and chords until they’re unstuck from time and feuding with the tempo. mood that spreads like smoke takes precedence over flashy production trickery, like the moonscape alienation on “knitted crown” or that burns holes in its own grainy film on “dark liquor.” these are beats that toy with emotions before listeners can even figure out where the loops are going. not that doesn’t knock—the bone-snap snares on “i’ll find you” and the latin-rhythm spasms of “clearbody” are there to pull in head nods, so the textural details can sink into your nerve endings."

d7965,"deep in the big rabbit island alternative as rabbit island, australian songwriter amber fresh puts a delicate, celestial spin on slow-burn balladry. her latest album, , has the poignancy of a lullaby, right down to fresh’s softly-murmured vocals. but just because its pace may be unhurried doesn’t mean its reach isn’t vast. fresh’s piano playing ranges from sparse and tentative, as on lead single “deep in the big,” to rippling and expansive, as on “boxing day.” other tracks introduce sleepy organ, while the closing “jonah’s dream” shelves keyboard instruments altogether to hang on folky acoustic guitar. a few guests from fresh’s hometown of perth show up along the way, including pond frontman nicholas allbrook, who contributes guitar and vocals. the lyrics aren’t always clear, but fresh takes a devastating, sigh-like approach to every track that pulls the heartstrings, even when the meaning is left vague. the wistful “interstate,” which recalls the aching, piano-centered tracks of cat power’s , sets fresh’s voice at a wavering remove without sacrificing emotional resonance. “zigrid” brings her voice much closer, layering it over rustling percussion and playful effects, while the nearly nine-minute “11, 12, 13” similarly gives the impression of her being right next to us, whispering like a trusted confidant. such painstaking intimacy is what sets rabbit island apart in the realm of low-key indie pop. fresh recorded the album back in 2015, but she has spent the intervening years perfecting its artwork, sequencing, and other small details. that revelation only adds to the unmistakable feeling that is something precious and handmade, glimmering with little secrets."

(in the for “clear tamei,” malliagh appears to get beaten up by a dmt elf.) elsewhere, there are opera singers getting stretched like chewing gum (“black light ultra”), what sounds like a prince guitar solo turned into some sort of starfighter aircraft engaging in a laser battle with yet more elves (“namā”), and a dubstep rave as imagined by an ai (“niteracer”). and on it goes. no sound exists for more than a microsecond before dissipating into thousands more or mutating into something freakish or foolish. it’s harrowingly brilliant."

d7970,"slide george clanton electronic when people first encountered george clanton’s music, it was either through his vaporwave project esprit 空想 or the reverb-soaked, retro pop he made as mirror kisses. both projects explored knowingly schmaltzy production styles and bore the sensibilities of someone who had immersed themselves in the early 2010s attempts to recreate the sound of early 1990s internet. when he shifted to recording under his own name for 2015’s , he turned these distinctions into assets, cranking them all to widescreen proportions, making swirling, maximalist synth pop that floated between pure honesty and pure exaggeration. now, three years later, presents clanton in a more mature form. lead singles “make it forever” and “dumb” both maintain the grandness of his previous work; clanton encases his vocals in echo while layering simple, heavy drum beats and explosive, soaring synth lines to trigger as many sonic climaxes as he can fit. but all that bombast can’t cover the undeniable sense of longing and yearning that permeates the album. “i guess we won’t stop drinking / ‘cause you’re in the wrong place and i’m in the wrong town,” clanton murmurs on “monster,” one of a handful of tracks where he willingly tones down his trademark grandiosity for a moment to express something tender and painful. these moments of vulnerability show that ’s—and clanton’s—true greatness lies not in the ability to overwhelm, but his inherent knack and understanding of a pop hook has the ability to elicit catharsis."
