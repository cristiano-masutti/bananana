His sold-out concert tours are an annual rite of summer for his legions of fans, affectionately known as Parrotheads, many of whom are professionals by day and who dress in spectacular and outrageous tropical outfits and headwear when Jimmy comes to town. Born in the Gulf Coast town of Pascagoula, Mississippi, he was raised in Mobile, Alabama. He is a fourth-generation sailor and fisherman, a pilot, a surfer, and a frequent traveler to remote and exotic places of the world, having become addicted to National Geographic magazine as a child. The lyrics to many of his songs are influenced by his travels all over the globe. As a best-selling author, he is one of only nine authors in the history of the New York Times Bestseller List to have reached #1 on both their fiction and non-fiction lists. Jimmy has received two Grammy nominations, numerous Country Music Association awards and was the recipient of one of the nation's highest songwriting honors when he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame."}

{"album": "Madres", "artist": "Sofia Kourtesis", "genre": ["Electronic"], "description": "Madres is, unsurprisingly, dedicated to Kourtesis' mother. More surprising though it is also dedicated to world-renowned neurosurgeon Peter Vajkoczy. The story of how a world-renowned neurosurgeon came to appear in the liner notes of this record is one of tenacity, miracles, all-consuming love and ultimately, of hope. When she began work on her debut, Kourtesis was seemingly unstoppable. A string of rapturously received EPs and singles made her one of the fastest rising stars in the electronic world and beyond. She has already graced the cover of Mixmag, released a brilliantly energetic and moving Resident Advisor ‘RA Session’, appeared on ‘End of Year’ lists from the likes of The New York Times, Pitchfork, DJ Mag and Spotify (#6 Best Electronic Song) and played instant sell-out early shows at London’s Lafayette and Manchester’s YES as well as standout performances at Glastonbury, Green Man, Wide Awake and Primavera and tours supporting Caribou and Bicep. In amongst touring and working though, Kourtesis was rushing home to Peru at any opportunity to be with her mother, who some months after the passing of her father – the subject of Kourtesis’ breakout single ‘La Perla’ – had been diagnosed with cancer and was deteriorating rapidly. \"Doctors were all the time calling me to say goodbye to her, for months\", she recalls. Refusing to lose hope, Kourtesis had spoken to every doctor she could get hold of and all of them told her chances were low, operation was too risky. Having read about Vajkoczy but knowing he was in incredibly high demand, in desperation she posted a music snippet on social media, promising to dedicate the track to Vajkoczy for just a few minutes of his time. Unbelievably he responded and agreed to meet. Vajkoczy agreed to operate. The operation was a success and Kourtesis’s mother’s life is extended further than anyone could have possibly hoped. With her mother now well and living nearby in Berlin, Kourtesis had her life back. Madres is the product of that life. Though it contains shades of the struggle of those years and her own mental health journey, Madres is joyful, awash with warm light and brimming with \"hope and the value that big love can create miracles\". It’s filled with the minutiae of life that Kourtesis didn’t have time or energy for; going out with friends, dating, dancing, eating, living. Vaikoczy became part of this world, an avid music fan himself he became something of a sounding board for the album and Kourtesis even took him on his first trip to Berghain."}

His sold-out concert tours are an annual rite of summer for his legions of fans, affectionately known as Parrotheads, many of whom are professionals by day and who dress in spectacular and outrageous tropical outfits and headwear when Jimmy comes to town. Born in the Gulf Coast town of Pascagoula, Mississippi, he was raised in Mobile, Alabama. He is a fourth-generation sailor and fisherman, a pilot, a surfer, and a frequent traveler to remote and exotic places of the world, having become addicted to National Geographic magazine as a child. The lyrics to many of his songs are influenced by his travels all over the globe. As a best-selling author, he is one of only nine authors in the history of the New York Times Bestseller List to have reached #1 on both their fiction and non-fiction lists. Jimmy has received two Grammy nominations, numerous Country Music Association awards and was the recipient of one of the nation's highest songwriting honors when he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame."}

His sold-out concert tours are an annual rite of summer for his legions of fans, affectionately known as Parrotheads, many of whom are professionals by day and who dress in spectacular and outrageous tropical outfits and headwear when Jimmy comes to town. Born in the Gulf Coast town of Pascagoula, Mississippi, he was raised in Mobile, Alabama. He is a fourth-generation sailor and fisherman, a pilot, a surfer, and a frequent traveler to remote and exotic places of the world, having become addicted to National Geographic magazine as a child. The lyrics to many of his songs are influenced by his travels all over the globe. As a best-selling author, he is one of only nine authors in the history of the New York Times Bestseller List to have reached #1 on both their fiction and non-fiction lists. Jimmy has received two Grammy nominations, numerous Country Music Association awards and was the recipient of one of the nation's highest songwriting honors when he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame."}

Taken as a whole, the collection stands as a radical act of creative liberation from an artist already known for pushing limits, a genre-defying work of healing and self-love that tips its cap to everything from Al Green and Otis Redding to Waylon Jennings and Bobbie Gentry in its relentless pursuit of peace and pleasure.

{"album": "Antarctica ", "artist": "Glåsbird", "genre": ["Electronic"], "description": "With this album, Glåsbird's 'A Sonic Expedition' draws to its close. It began at the North Pole, in the frozen waters of the Arctic Ocean and it ends at the South Pole, on the world's least populated continent; the ice-capped desolate grandeur that is Antarctica. It had been suspected that this land existed long before it had been discovered and many had died in their pursuit to find it. Some may even have died as a consequence of accidentally discovering it, through detoured voyages striking into glaciers. The music here in Antarctica returns to Modern Classical, as the artist comes full circle. Echoes of 2019's debut album set in Greenland can be felt in places, as soaring violin and cello collide. However, these 8 tracks gather up the compositional and technical learning throughout the series, as Glåsbird looks forward to the challenges of the future. The photography in this album is from Oceanographer Neha Ramsarup, who traveled on the South African polar vessel SA Agulhas II, deploying instruments and collecting seawater samples along the voyage from Cape Town (South Africa) to South African National Antarctic Expedition (SANAE IV). These trips are joined by a range of marine scientists, whose keen interests lie in ocean properties such as sea ice and weather as well as mammals, birds, whales and penguins who call these polar regions home. This special limited edition release is in a run of 100 copies. Modeled around the classic gatefold vinyl LP. It includes printed front, rear and inner sleeves and a card sleeve housing a printed vinyl-effect CDr."}

{"album": "Funk the System EP", "artist": "Credit 00", "genre": ["Electronic"], "description": "Funk The System! The recipe is simple: Dig deep, listen to your heart, record everything you got on a dusty old desktop computer, leave it to simmer for the time of a pandemic, and if it’s still fresh, serve it up on the finest plate of black wax! This collaboration started in Düsseldorf in the year 2018. Locked up for a week in the Flanger Studios, Wolf Müller and Credit 00 recorded everything: from the jaw harp to smartphone apps, chopping up GDR Jazz breaks and squeezing the Funk out of every synthesizer and drum machine at hand. You will hear the open mindedness towards all sorts of musical influences from the first note. Each of the five tracks showcases a wild mix of flavours: Disco Reggae, B-Girl Breakbeats, Protest Folk, Subway Funk, Tabla Rhythms, you name it... they’ll take it and shake it! It is obvious these two got sonically socialized and educated by the multiculturalism of Hip-Hop in their early days. After the first Recording Session, the tracks fermented for some time until they were cracked open again. This time in Leipzig at Credit 00’s Westend Workshop. That’s also where Rizmi from Birmingham joined the team and lent her voice to the title track. She reinterpreted the lyrics of the obscure German 1980s Workers’ Rock Song, that Wolf digged out for the Intro Skit of „Funk The System“. A long time in the making, Rat Life is very happy to finally publish this EP!\r \r Credits: Produced at Wolf Müller Flanger Studios Düsseldorf and Westend Workshop Leipzig. Synth scratching on \"Ursuppe\" by DJ Normal 4. Artwork by Credit 00 & Wolf Müller themselves! Mastered at Tailout Tape Masters. Shout outs 2 all the sisters and brothers in mind! Don't let the system get you down. May the Funk B with you! R.I.P. Duke Bootee!\r \r C&P from Ratlife's Bandcamp-Page!"}

{"album": "Beyond Orbits", "artist": "挾間美帆", "genre": ["Jazz"], "description": "Beyond Orbits is the new album from composer and conductor Miho Hazama, the vibrant new album that, with her ensemble M-Unit, celebrates their 10th anniversary this year. This album is testament to her endless creativity and artistic vision that has prompted her remarkable growth of her career in Japan, Europe and the US in recent years. Beyond Orbits is an album born out of the challenges that unfolded over the past few years. Confined to a small apartment in Harlem, New York, during the pandemic, amidst a backdrop of intense political turbulence, including a consequential presidential election, Miho Hazama was faced with a profound sense of disconnection. Redirecting her focus beyond the tumultuous world, Miho decided to shift her focus away from the world and began researching exoplanets. She found two with unique characteristics and decided to create a concept around them. After receiving a prestigious commission in 2021 from the Monterey Jazz Festival, Miho Hazama wrote a new work that resulted in the Exoplanet Suite, which pays homage to the captivating wonders of the exoplanetary realm. This idea became the core of the album with movements titled Electro Elliptical Orbits, As a Three Sunlight and Planet Nine. \"Canʼt Hide Love\" composed by Skip Scarborough is published by Unichappell Music Inc., arranged by Miho Hazama.  All songs composed by Miho Hazama are published by JamRice Music Publishing Inc., JASRAC.  Producer: Miho Hazama  Co-Producers: Hiroaki G Muramatsu, Masu H.

First appearing as the guttural b-side to the world historic and epochally transformitive single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" which was itself composed., howsoever vaguely, as both parody and homage to Chubby Checker's 1960 Billboard topping 7\", \"The Twist\" covering the B-side to Hank Ballard & The Midnighters \"Teardrops on your Letter,\" TFS here continues the tradition of recognizing the hidden power of bringing occult banger B-Sides back as A-Sides.  As many of you know, Fiona of TFS is still undergoing cancer treatment.  With any luck, the band will be fully operational very soon.  In the meantime, we are so glad that we were able to unearth this cover sitting in the cans-releasing it to only you guys."}

André Herman Dune) latest solo album Good Moon is a collection of love songs, of drinking songs, caught in the dusk as the sun retreats and the moon takes centre stage. The good moon comes after the full moon, when everything comes down and you can finally get some work done - be it building a house, or a boat, or recording an album… It's the most achieved album Stanley Brinks ever made. Good Moon follows a series of acclaimed albums with The Wave Pictures, a pair of folk shanty and old-time calypso albums alongside Norway’s The Kaniks, and is scheduled for release shortly after another new record from Stanley, Iron Eye, this time alongside longtime collaborator and touring-partner Clemence Freschard. Freschard appears on drums throughout Good Moon, with backing vocals from guests including anti-folk legend Jeffrey Lewis, The Burning Hell’s Mathias Kom, The Moldy Peaches’ Toby Goodshank and Maltese multimedia artist Alexandra Aquilina. All songs by Stanley Brinks. Drums by Freschard. Backing vocals by: - Freschard and Alexandra Aquilina (2, 3, 5, 9,13) - Bruce Rock, Jeffrey Lewis, Mathias Kom, Toby Goodshank (1, 8, 11) - Daniel Borg (3) Recorded in Berlin 2022\""}

{"album": "Sex", "artist": "MC Вспышкин", "genre": ["Electronic", "Pop"], "description": "Хиты питерского дуэта «MC Вспышкин и Никифоровна» в середине 2000-х звучали на всех танцполах страны. Турков всегда был колоритным персонажем, а к 2000-м его образ стал еще интереснее – накачанный дед с прической и бородой, как у Деда Мороза. Одевался он всегда эпатажно. Монетизировать (хотя тогда такого слова еще не было) свой образ Владимир Александрович решил случайным образом, отправившись на кастинг, который проводила одна из радиостанций. Радийщикам был нужен «хэви-метал-дед». Турков успешно прошел отбор, получив псевдоним MC Вспышкин. В начале проекта ему было около 70 лет. MC Вспышкин был лицом многих крупных питерских рейвов: «Колбасный Цех», «Вспышка сверхновой», «День молодежи». Лицом, но не голосом. Озвучивал его, в том числе и в песнях, актер Дмитрий Бекоев. В 2003 году судьба свела Туркова с группой «Никифоровна». Данный коллектив к тому времени существовал около года, в числе его участников был 19-летний Дима Чеков, тоже уроженец Ленинграда. Представители радио «Рекорд» создали из Туркова и Чекова новую группу – «MC Вспышкин и Никифоровна». И это был настоящий взрыв. Песни для новой группы писал Дима Чеков, он же Никифоровна, он же Бабка (имитировал голос пожилой женщины с характерным «окающим» говором). Дмитрий Бекоев в треках дуэта звучал, как советский диктор. Это было очень колоритно. В 2004 году «MC Вспышкин и Никифоровна» выпустили легендарный танцевальный альбом «Sex». Их хиты «Новогодняя (Меня прет)», «Дискотэка», «Колбасный цех 3 (Шишки)» и многие другие гремели отовсюду. Издание на лимитированном желтом виниле."}

Bristol based singer Joe Yorke has once again been busy in the studio with his old time friend and long time collaborator, producer, songwriter and multi instrumentalist Eeyun Purkins. Alongside Eeyun's studio band The Co-Operators they have recorded a brand new long player 'A Distant Beat'. It features eight kitchen sink stories from the breadline, message music for these desperate times. Musically enclosed in their trade mark sound it combines soulful rocksteady & forward stepping reggae with that distinctly authentic flavor that Eeyun's productions have become known for. With three LPs already under their belts The Co-Operators haven't taken their foot off the gas since bursting on to the scene with their 2019 debut 'Rhythms from the Kitchen Sink'. The album's lead single 'Tonight', a track that saw Joe York's falsetto unleashed on the world, is still seeing heavy rotation on sound systems around the world. Hot on the tail of a number of collaborations including two singles with Stand High Patrol and Joe's self produced LP 'Noise and Emptiness', Joe and Eeyun don't seem to be slowing down and they are excited for you to hear this latest body of work.\r \r Sam ‘Big Chip’ Huelin on lead guitar on A1, A3 & B4 Jasper Pattison on bass on B2 Alex Gordon on trumpet on B1 & B2 Matt Dowse on trombone B1 & B2 Joe Yorke on syndrum on A2, additional keys on A3 & mouth organ on B3 Beanie Entwistle on saxophone on B4 Dennison Joseph on mute guitar on A4 Eeyun Purkins on all other instruments (bass, drums, guitar, piano, organ and percussion) Lyrics written by Eeyun. All tracks were recorded (with exception of lead guitar on A3, mute guitar on A4, mouth organ on B3 and vocals on A1, A2, A4, B1, B3 & B4) at Waggle Dance Studios. Produced and mixed by Eeyun. Mastered by Pressure Mastering. Front cover by Maya Mitten and back cover photo taken by and belongs to Anni Kay (AKA Hulme Loonies) Repressed in September 2023 with different coloured labels. 500 copies"}

{"album": "Pas Fréquentables", "artist": "Satan Jokers", "genre": ["Rock"], "description": "« Pas Fréquentables » est le nouveau double-album de SATAN JOKERS reprenant les plus grands standards du groupe. Il contient un CD de 12 titres enregistrés en concert avec Renaud HANTSON au chant, Michaël ZURITA à la guitare, Pascal MULOT à la basse et Aurélien OUZOULIAS à la batterie. Le second CD contient 17 versions anglaises jamais publiées de divers titres du groupe enregistrés après sa reformation en 2009. Le tout est mixé et masterisé par l’ingénieur du son Anthony ARCONTE avec qui Renaud HANTSON travaille depuis la fin des années 80 et qui est aux côtés du quartet sur tous les albums depuis 2009. « Pas Fréquentables » est un double album « épitaphe » , mettant en lumière les incroyables parties de guitares de Michaël ZURITA, l’inimitable jeu de basse de Pascal MULOT, les plans de batterie improbables d’Aurel OUZOULIAS et la voix unique de Renaud HANTSON leader depuis le début des 80’s du groupe le plus controversé de l’histoire du Rock français ! Controversé certainement parce que trop en avance sur son temps depuis 1983 et la parution du 1er disque « Les Fils du Metal », too much too soon, avant-garde et faussement mégalo mais définitivement inventeur de ce qu’on appelle aujourd’hui communément le Metal Fusion ! « Pas Fréquentables » balaie la carrière du groupe de ses débuts avec Stéphane BONNEAU, Pierre GUIRAUD, Laurent BERNAT (RIP) et Renaud HANTSON à aujourd’hui avec une Dream Team en guise de second line up. Ce double album (censé être le dernier mais il ne faut jamais dire jamais avec SATAN JOKERS) nous offre de belles surprises, des chansons qui rentrent dans la tête pour ne plus en sortir tout en montrant la dextérité de musiciens exceptionnels et passionnés. Après « Addictions » en 2011, concept album écrit avec le professeur Laurent KARILA, validé par la MILDECA (mission interministérielle de lutte contre les drogues et les conduites addictives), puis « Symphönïk Kömmandöh » en 2018, enregistré avec un orchestre classique du sud de la France dirigé par Florent GAUTHIER, « Pas Fréquentables » est un double album collector qui montre, avec son CD Live masterisé sans retouche en studio et un second CD dans la langue de Shakespeare, que SATAN JOKERS n’avait rien à envier aux ténors anglo-saxons du genre !"}

Spoken word piece by someone with a Nordic-sounding accent (possibly fake), transcript as follows: \"Well, if you ask me the world will end with a big sticky and sweet explosion of bubblegum. Imagine it; all the dogs in the world are chewing on gum and suddenly they all blow bubbles at the same time. Their bubbles keep growing and growing until they merge together into one gigantic bubble that envelops the entire comet. And then with a satisfying pop, the bubble bursts showering the world with a rain of sticky, sugary goodness. Everyone and everything is covered in bubblegum and there is no good way to escape its sticky embrace. But don’t worry, it’s not the end of the world. It’s just the beginning of our new fun-filled adventure where we all get to play on our world made of bubblegum. Of course this is just a playful and imaginative interpretation of how the world might end and there is no good way to know for sure what the future holds. The important thing is to approach life with a spirit of playfulness and curiosity and to find joy in every moment whether it's sweet or sticky or something better. Nietzsche believed in the concept of the will to power which refers to the fundamental drive for individuals and societies to assert their power and wants over others. In the context of our world covered in bubblegum, it is possible that individuals or groups might try to assert their dominance over others by controlling the resources or means to remove the bubblegum will be using the sticky situation to their advantage. Moreover, Nietzsche believed in the importance of embracing life’s challenges and difficulties as they can lead to personal growth and self-improvement. In the context of our world covered in bubblegum, individuals might have to find new and creative ways to navigate to the sticky environment which could potentially lead to new discoveries and innovations.” Housed in clear plastic sleeve with 'Made in Czech Republic' sticker on it."}

The ROLLING STONES are more than just a group - they are a way of life. A way of life that has captured the imagination of the nation's teenagers, and made them one of the most sought after groups in Beatdom. For the Stones have their fingers on the pulse of the basic premise of \"pop\" music success - that its public buys sound, and the sound is what they give you with this their first album; a raw, exciting basic approach to Rhythm and Blues which, blended with their five own explosive characters, has given them three smash hits and an E.P. that stayed in the single charts for fifteen weeks. In the eight months since the Stones embarked on their pop career, they have not only chalked up major chart successes, but smashed attendance records on tours the length and breadth of the country. They have emerged as five well rounded intelligent talents, who will journey successfully far beyond the realms of pop music. And in this album there are twelve good reasons why. Andrew Loog Oldham."}

Open pre-order resulted in 74 copies. The track position numbers are numbered incorrectly due to \"SIDE A\" and \"SIDE B\" also being numbered (see images). They have been corrected in the tracklist above. The cassette shells feature glitter and on-body printing. \"Pokémon: Blue Version was released in North America in 1998. I was 8 years old. In my earliest memories playing it, it’s summer in my grandmother’s basement, I’m under blanket forts, I’m wrapped in my hand-woven purple blanket, and I’m sharing a super size fry with my grandmother (before they got rid of them). I played. I napped. I would wake, and I would play. I would train, I would explore, and I would nap. The music lives in my heart. In PokéDreams: Blue Version, Red Version, and Yellow Version, I wanted to recreate those earliest feelings of excitement, of exploration, and of peace. Blue was created with more slumbery (and perhaps spooky, more night-time) tones including the Lavender, Pokémon tower, and Jigglypuff tracks. Pallet Town is by far my favorite song of any in the series and, fittingly, it was the first I ever created. Red was created with some intentionally brighter and cheery moods; both Cinnabar Island as well as evolution, for example, feel like tending to a gently-lit fire at sunset. If Blue Version is walking through a sleepy, gentle forest, then Red Version is watching the sun rise from your blanket fort, not quite awake, looking forward to a fresh new day.\r \r Yellow was created with an intent to explore. In terms of song choice, I prioritized unused tracks found by the fan community through data mining and ROM analysis, like the alternate (unused) ending track, field route, and the unused victory theme (titled “勝利 victory!\" on the album). I also included the Yellow Version tracks - Pikachu’s Beach and the Yellow Version title screen theme - which I wasn’t familiar with, since my best friend had this version and I didn’t. This album is fresh to my ears with songs that are less familiar to me, yet they feel exciting and fun - like the beach!\""}

{"album": "Lost At Sea", "artist": "Chris Shiflett", "genre": ["Folk, World, & Country"], "description": "Tri-fold digisleeve Notes from the label : Punk veteran. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee. Americana and rock songwriter. Modern-day guitar hero. For more than 25 years, Chris Shiflett has blurred the lines between genre and generation, balancing his full-band projects with a thriving solo career.  He turns a new page with Lost at Sea, a solo record that builds a bridge between Nashville — where Shiflett has become a frequent visitor, performing on the Grand Ole Opry one minute and collaborating with Music City tastemakers like Jaren Johnston and Dave Cobb the next — and his native California. Caught halfway between the honky-tonk saloon and the punk-rock dive bar, Lost at Sea is both eclectic and electric, making room for alt-country crunch, guitar-driven grit, and sharp songwriting. Tying that mix together is Shiflett himself: a musical Renaissance Man whose influences are every bit as wide-ranging as his resumé.  Shiflett recorded the majority of Lost at Sea in Nashville, working with producer and collaborator Jaren Johnston—frontman of the Cadillac Three, as well as the songwriter behind nearly a dozen Number 1 country hits—and a small cast of Americana all-stars. Among them were fellow guitar slingers Worsham, Bukovac, and Nathan Keeterle, all three of whom laced the record with fiery fretwork. He also teamed up with a number of co-writers, partnering with Kendell Marvel, Cody Jinks, and others to fill Lost at Sea with storylines that pack as hefty a punch as the music itself. Lost at Sea showcases the full range of Shiflett's abilities. There are harmonized guitar solos worthy of Thin Lizzy, amplified country anthems, and roots-rockers steeped in Tom Petty's influence. The breakneck pace and palm-muted guitars of \"Parties\" salute Shiflett's early days within the Bay Area punk scene, while \"Damage Control\" — with its layers of reverb, pulsing percussion, and Echoplex tape delay — flirts with the atmospheric dub music that Lee Scratch Perry introduced. Everything is grounded in melody. Shiflett nods to his heroes throughout, but he charts his own territory, too, whipping up a diverse sound that's distinctly his own."}

Side A has the same tracks as the 2 LP version  of \"Murder of the Universe\" but has no runout info (nor room for any as the runout area is very narrow). The runout on side B indicates that the pressing plate was created for Side A of \"Omnium Gatherum\" (KGLW013), but the \"A-1\" doesn't match any version of \"Omnium Gatherum\" in Discogs. Hence it seems likely that neither pressing plate was used on any \"non-mutant\" release."}

The album maps journeys of self-discovery as she unpacks intimate experiences with a maturity and cathartic outlook. Specifically, the tracks on ‘crux’ discuss the death of an old friend, her meditations on the fragility of life and the delicacy of relationships in times of uncertainty. More than anything it’s about the importance of creativity and writing while healing, and on an individual level, looking inward and the examination of one’s grief, anxiety, and insecurities. Musically it searches outward, it includes the use of traditional folk, Celtic to communicate her Scottish roots, and Eastern-European styles, all introduced to her lush, atmospheric production, intricate vocal harmonies, and complex rhythms."}
