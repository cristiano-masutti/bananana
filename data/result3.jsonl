By reading an article or three, a person can learn about long-term nuclear waste warning messages, nuclear semiotics, even prehistoric-looking government repositories full of art projects—ominous, massive granite constructions designed to create a dialogue between the past and the future. That dialogue is present on the 12 tracks that comprise  , the second album from Oakland-based artist Maria BC. Fresh encounters and old recollections converse with one another in delicate vocal arrangements, sawlike electronic textures, sparse guitars, and a detuned baby Steinway piano. That beauty and vulnerability doesn’t come without pain: the lyrics explore aching memories, struggle, and grief. Crystalline synths and a rising, triumphant chorus introduce the mesmerizing “Watcher,” where obscured lyrics are woven into a trio of vocal harmonies. On “Haruspex,” Maria BC’s voice emerges alone, accompanied by electric guitar and percussion that punctuates unsettled questions (“Is my body right?”). The artist’s voice is doubled on “Return to Sender,” where menacing waves of synth form a dramatic backdrop for lyrics that detail a failed attempt at connection. With gracious defeat, the speaker concedes: “I’ll just let my answers get sent back.” The first portion of   is drawn from a palette of thoughts and questions, the music wandering in and out: part tangible dreamy melodies, part barren electronic landscape. The sense of desolation becomes more palpable, but no less exquisite, as the album goes on. On “Daydrinker,” a sustained vocalization—somber at first, then progressively more angelic—blends with reversed guitar, resulting in a dark, deep well of sound. “Still” delivers a message of finality (“Nothing is wrong/ We deserve what we deserve”) above an echoing piano that grows in volume until it becomes the centerpiece of the song. “Lacuna” (in Latin, “pit” or “gap”) is filled with chimes, giddy, glitchy effects, and throbbing vocals, a hiatus from the album’s emotional barrenness. That reprieve ends with “Mercury,” a stormy and discordant return to earlier turmoil. Throughout, Maria BC’s voice is elastic: allowing them to achieve both somber, spectral tones and celestial, victorious highs. A beautifully crafted, bracingly candid meditation on memory and personal experience,   is arresting, auspicious, and fully-formed.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/maria-bc-spike-field-review"}

Until now, the Montreal-based artist has worked alone in this capacity, constructing songs from archived sounds recorded on his cellphone during studies in Concordia’s Electroacoustic program. On  , Lake welcomes contributions from fellow members of the free-improv ensemble Egyptian Cotton Arkestra, lacing their instrumentation into delicate, textural works where everything remains in its right place. Explaining the way his creative process takes precedence over the finished project,  , “the painting itself is less important than… painting. The music itself is less important than making music.” For the latest in his series of generically numbered albums, Lake brought a selection of nearly completed tracks to his longtime collaborators James Goddard (saxophone, mbira), Ari Swan (violin), and Lucas Huang (guitar, drums). Spending a day at Montreal’s famed Hotel2Tango studio, these three players added spontaneous flourishes for Lake to use as supplementary building blocks. The familiar sounds of his cycling arpeggios are complemented by alternately mournful and majestic orchestration, giving  ’s songs a newfound gravitas. Borrowing a trick from  ’s sequential track titles, “AS ABOVE” and “SO BELOW” are two of the busiest pieces here, layering sawing strings and skronking sax over insistent electronics. The 31-second “Interlude” sounds like a generator sputtering to life at an outdoor punk show, while “mdhvn” could be confused with an orchestra tuning up while a computer processes advanced calculations. “Death (pt. 2)” is both the album’s thematic and literal centerpiece, tucking its quivering woodwinds, elongated violins, and the plunky metallic tines of the mbira under a blanket of ominous drones. More than any other Markus Floats song, it resembles the score for an imagined horror film, infusing eerie melodicism with tactile sound art in the style of  . In live performances, Lake integrates spoken word excerpts from revolutionary Black figures such as Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison, and Huey Newton. The song titled “C” concludes   with sampled speech from poet and activist  , using this technique in Markus Floats’ recorded output for the first time. Hammering home Lake’s beliefs in socially engaged collaboration and the journey sharing equal importance with its destination, Moten drops the mic with a powerfully poetic koan: “What we’ve been trying to figure out how to get to is how we are when we get together to try to figure it out.”  ", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/markus-floats-fourth-album-review"}

You can easily imagine the three members of the Cincinnati-based dance-punk trio squashed shoulder to shoulder, cheek by jowl, hunched over their studio  , furiously operating a coleslaw of wires and cityscapes of equipment. In quieter moments, there’s an audible white noise fry of switched-on electronics. Everything bleeds in. Such is the turbulent quality of the record that the vocals in tracks such as “Cheap Chrome” and “Order Imposing Sentence” seem pushed off to the side, like a manic presence somewhere just offstage; Andie Luman and Dylan McCartney sound malevolent, while Dakota Carlyle seems almost queasily uninterested. In Alan Vega fashion, the lyrics are frequently unintelligible, but random phrases occasionally emerge from the confusion—”triangles of terror!”, “disconnect!”, “elec-tric!” Although the meaning isn’t often apparent, their interplay with the monochrome, nocturnal arrangements suggests a series of disconnected vignettes in a film or book played out against the backdrop of one city on one night. (The songs even share the terse, punchy wording of pulp fiction titles—“Ending Of The Stream,” “Suspension Bridge Collapse,” “Beat Me Down.”) The meaning might not always be apparent, but the feeling always is. Although   is The Serfs’ third album, you would be forgiven for thinking it is their first. It has the ferocious, listen-to-this-immediately quality of the best debuts. There are slower moments, granted—“Spectral Analysis” is one highlight, a kind of sewage runoff from exotica music and George Michael—but this expedient style stretches across the record, with simple drum machine patterns repeating until they short out, flurries of garbled lyrics, and a barrage of electronic flotsam and jetsam like gnarled keyboard sounds and static-y textures. Despite the frenzy of this wonky success, though, there’s still the underlying sense that everything on this record has been placed precisely where it needs to be.", "genre": ["Rock", "garage rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-serfs-half-eaten-by-dogs-review"}

It’s England that dominates the conversation, and for good reason: groups like  ,  ,  , and   would have an outsize influence in how the genre would be defined. Post-punk has become so enshrined in the history of rock music—and so popular that it’s been stylistically   again and again—that it’s easy to forget how revolutionary it was in the early ‘80s. Inspired by the DIY spirit of punk, but largely untethered from the musical lexicon from rock music, musicians on the bleeding edge used whatever they could get their hands on to swim against the tide of popular music and create sounds never heard before.  is a survey of how the avant-garde shaped up in an oft-ignored European nation. Even inside Switzerland, the country’s post-punk history isn’t particularly well documented. Swiss DJ and   compiler  ’s first experience with post-punk from his own country was discovering the group KonX via an Italian language music blog. Synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines became more common fixtures in rock ensembles as the technology became more accessible, but KonX was unique in that everything was created digitally in frontman Peter Felippi’s Electronic Music Multitrack studio. Fascinated by the dark, murky synth melody of “…Basic Ground Without Voice…” (included here in an edited form), Aslan rolled up his sleeves and went digging in dusty crates for more. The artists he stumbled upon had fascinating stories. Dr. Chattanooga & The Navarones played their first live act as an opener for Flame Dream—a popular Swiss prog group—but the performance might not have happened if their demo tape hadn’t gotten lost on the way to the show’s promoters. Concertgoers hoping for similar symphonic stylings to the headlining band were sorely disappointed and the organizers asked The Navarones to leave (though they ignored the request and continued to play). “Kabyl Marabù” offers some clues why the crowd might not have been ready: its wonky tempo and sprechgesang vocal delivery is augmented with bizarre samples like chirping birds, croaking frogs, and jingling coins. This was not easy listening. The diversity of what’s here illustrates how difficult it can be to pin down what post-punk even  . Some tracks more closely resemble the English sound we’re used to, like “Labyrinth” by Jürg Nutz, but others are nearly unrecognizable. Café Türk borrows heavily from Jamaican dub reggae on “Söyledir,” while Bells of Kyoto pull influence from jazz fusion and Middle Eastern rhythms on “Asho II.” Even in such a small geographical area, the underground was diverse and non-localized; most of these bands weren’t even aware of one another.   doesn’t draw stylistic parallels between artists or construct an easy narrative to follow, but that in itself tells a story of the experimental spirit of Swiss rock.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/senza-decoro-liebe-and-anarchia-switzerland-review"}

This time around, there’s a little more chutzpah, thanks to his affinity for skateboarding—another medium for raw and authentic self-expression. We return once again to Shabason’s childhood, where as a 14-year-old, he was enraptured by Toy Factory’s impossibly punk 31-minute montage of brilliance and bravado. Each track on   pays homage to a specific skateboarder’s section from the original video.

The street smarts of Mike Maldonado beget a deep and dissonant funk. The power and precision of Ed Templeton summon some breathy sax and syncopated, industrial percussion. The title track and album closer is a more gentle auditory embrace featuring the album’s only lyrics, written by guitarist Thom Gil. It’s the album’s most acute juxtaposition, accompanying the video’s “bail” section, known to be one of the most brutal of its era and not for the faint of heart. “The place where you are final finally,” Gil sings. “Yes, please jump through, you don’t recognize its form.”  —it is what you make it.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/joseph-shabason-welcome-to-hell-review"}

This particular blend of sounds has been integral to Tibetan-Nepalese-Swiss creator  s style since her first EP in 2013. And given that it no longer sounds radically new, you might think that it’s in danger of losing its edge—but that would be missing the point. First, there are sonic absolutes in play here: the use of high frequencies and the jagged leaps from silence to slamming industrial drums means the music will always have an adrenalized unease to it. Second, and even more important, this music was never about its novelty, but the fact that it provided a language for exploratory musicians like Devi to operate outside of the norms of the club and experimental electronica establishments. To put it mildly, there remains a vast amount still to be said in that language. And Aïsha Devi has always had a lot to say. Anyone who has ever witnessed her live shows will know that she is a born performer and consummate musician, and on her third album—and first in five years—that fact is clearer than ever. From the outset, it’s clear that she’s upped her production game, a fact that’s clinched by the way the piercing high-pitched synth in opener “Not Defined by the Visible” swerves and glides into complex, even joyous melodies. Throughout the album, the tension between that cold, gothic, industrial edge and pure pleasure is examined and played with. The bodily groove of trap beats and the use of pop melody on tracks like the centerpiece “Unborn Yet Alive” aren’t just affectation, they’re integral to what this record  . It’s an intense experience. Devi has talked a lot about self-realization through her art, and it’s easy to feel the sheer force of will creating something through the ritualistic processes here—the pounding second half of the album’s eight-minute closer is not for the faint of heart, but its payoff is majestic. But perhaps the album’s emblematic track is “Dimensional Spleen,” a collaboration with Kenyan producer  . The simultaneous silliness and disquieting nature of the title sets the tone for a tune that simultaneously feels like a sci-fi war machine, a rewiring of your synapses, and a whimsical pop song—albeit one sung by interdimensional sprites. There’s a lot to it, and a lot to this album in general: proof positive that this neo-gothic sound palette is maturing into something durable and deep-seated.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/aisha-devi-death-is-home-review"}

Recorded while Drop Nineteens’ members were still university students,   earned critical acclaim upon its release, yet the quintet only survived several years before disbanding.

Reverb-drenched and murky, it hurdled from British post-punk melodicism to big grungy licks complete with a poppy sensibility, in large part due to the aching confessionals and face-melting cries let loose by bassist and vocalist Itarya Rosenberg. While   conjured bleary-eyed images of a plastered late-night at some dark and dingy DIY basement, Rid Of Me’s sophomore effort, , is huge, even arena-sized.

But even when struggling with demons, there’s a flickering glimmer of hope as   fairly bursts with a new lease on life-type energy.

On  his third solo album, Morimoto keeps his eyes on what matters artistically and interrogates everything else. “It didn’t used to be content/ It used to be art,” Morimoto sighs on “Feel Change,” before going on to lament how the music industry encourages social climbing and “deconstructing my identity for opportunities on “Reality.” His clearest attempt at defining the opposition to these spiritual bummers is in “If The Answer Isn’t Love,” on which he asks a higher power what will remain when the world as we know it has crumbled. “If the answer isn’t love/ Then forget that I asked,” is the punchline. The destruction Morimoto imagines nods to the literal threat of world disaster, but also to the way disillusionment can ravage your sense of purpose. While previous Morimoto albums have been defined by chaotic, rambling maximalism,  is far more structured around hooks and grooves, though no less compositionally complex. “If The Answer Isn’t Love” sounds like a Motown track with fuzzed-out guitar solos. “Bad State” is a psychedelic funk cut, a little reminiscent of Toro Y Moi with its big, bold vocal hooks. It’s a kind of songwriting that’s easy to take at face value, which bolsters Morimoto’s words, turning them into transmissions meant to be clearly received. That’s most prominent on the album’s standout, title track “Diagnosis.” This is the one song where Morimoto really lets himself shine as a rapper, hamming up his voice and showing off with his rhymes. He explores life under capitalism’s boot, the feeling of working all day to afford the comforts you need to keep working, too exhausted to envision an alternative. “Capital manipulates the labor/ Make a bag, it feels like it’ll save ya/ The money never acts against its nature/ Fuck the cops, the banks, the legislature,” is his mic-drop moment at the end of the excellent second verse. Often across  it feels like Morimoto takes on the role of a friend offering gentle but urgent advice. “At some point, you’ll have to start living your life instead of thinking about it,” he sings on “Bad State”; “Picking at scabs won’t heal them faster/ In fact, you’ll make a scar out of nothing,” on “What You Say.” That his tone is encouraging, as opposed to despondent, feels deliberate.

On his latest “solo” work,  , Shiroishi works in tandem not with another human performer, but with the space offered by monumental architecture. And while musicians have long used the cavernous acoustics of cathedrals and churches to impart a certain grandiosity, here Shiroishi performs in a shrine to L.A.’s cult of the personal vehicle: a parking structure. Recorded in a single take, the record explores sonic negative space, staking out improvised interactions between silence, performance, and resonance. Stepping onto the well-trodden territory of Japanese philosophy, Shiroishi refers to the concept of 間 (“ma,” or negative space) when discussing the album in the liner notes. On opener “stand still like a hummingbird,” the spaces in between the notes leave room for a thickly reverberant atmosphere which his sparse, staccato saxophone intimations disrupt, the tones settling like dust. Other tracks are packed with rapid, virtuosic runs (“i almost said”) or smooth, melodic figures (“if only heaven would give me another ten years”). Shiroishi explores how different saxophone timbres (and even crisp glockenspiel in “how will we get back to life again?”) interact with the concrete walls around him, shifting from smooth to strained to whispered tones. The effect is at once minimalist and abstract, requiring an attentive ear to indulge in its capacious sound. This abstract music isn’t being made in a vacuum, however, as “tule lake blues” suggests.

But in the context of an exploration of space—particularly negative, or so-called “empty” space—the solemn tones of “tule lake blues” not only call to mind the vacated homes of Japanese American internees but also the “empty” land onto which they were relocated. No land in America, after all, is truly empty, and Tule Lake was the largest example of how land dispossessed from Indigenous Americans was   for wartime incarceration. So in the plaintive wails that Shiroishi extracts from his sax—at times evoking a violin, at others a piercing shriek—we might hear the politics of space and its emptying; the history of two removals, one predicated on the other.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/patrick-shiroishi-i-was-too-young-to-hear-silence-review"}

Over a peppy ’80s infomercial–style backing track, the digital voice sketches out a corporate goal focused on persuading an unsuspecting populace to buy into “a system of lifestyle and industry applications designed to curate a desired multi-experience.” Then the voice speeds up so it can babble out a disclaimer that absolves the company of any and all potential liability. Against this backdrop of a fictional capitalist monster corporation, Aesop Rock explores the ways technology—and humankind’s predictable abuse of it—shapes both the world and the individual. “Two point five million years ago/ A friend of mine made a tool from a stone and defended his tribe,” raps the MC over the wormy funk of agenda-setting cut “Mindful Solutionism.” The track, a nod to vintage Run-DMC rhyme patterns, goes on to itemize a sarcastic list of developments that sprung from that first invention, including weaponized atom splitting, automated workforces, and chemistry-facilitated genocide. “Cameras in your favorite corners, plastic in the wilderness,” continues Aesop Rock, reaching the crux of the tirade: “We can not be trusted with the stuff that we come up with/ The machinery could eat us—we just really love our buttons.” Aesop Rock displays a hefty dose of skepticism emanates across the 18-track album, on which the MC’s bars are laid atop a selection of mostly self-produced backdrops that often strike a bluesy note thanks to judicious use of prowling basslines and deliberately downcast guitar. On “Pigeonometry,” the MC describes the way Leonardo Da Vinci’s inventions and theories have been twisted and exploited. Four songs into the album,   graces “Living Curfew” with a guest verse that casts him as a lonesome observer of eerie times: “I remember when nights was ambulance sirens/ Watching ’em put bodies inside ’em/ Sometimes somebody outside whylin’ on empty streets dead silent/ Half-empty stores, scared to breathe,” raps woods, flashing back to the early days of the pandemic over a backdrop of murmuring blues. As the album nears its conclusion, a more hopeful environmental vision emerges. Aesop casts his gaze towards nature as an escape route from the capitalist tech grind on “By The River.” An ode to the nourishing power of bodies of water, Aesop sketches a portrait of the Hudson, Susquehanna, and Willamette rivers that’s shot through with childlike wonder. “I wonder what could possibly be lurking on the bottom,” he raps over gently undulating funk. “I look into the water and imagine all the options.” In the end, it’s the ideal of discovery and imagination that becomes the antidote to the relentless march for profit.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/aesop-rock-integrated-tech-solutions-review"}

In retrospect, her eight-year stint in the 8G Band makes perfect sense given the post-hardcore/punk-rock pedigree of her bandmates, which included Syd Butler and Seth Jabour ( ); Eli Janney ( ); and time keeper-turned-actor Fred Armisen (Trenchmouth).

Enter   the long overdue return of the New York native’s first love: leaping into the void like her life depends on it. Or at the very least, her existential sense of self and overall happiness—something she appears to directly address on the tightly wound opening track “Plain Speak.” As Stern’s riffs careen across the splashy percussion of Arcade Fire drummer Jeremy Gara—a fitting replacement for past foils like Zach Hill ( ) and Kid Millions ( )—she repeats a mantra we can all relate to: “I can’t keep on moving backwards.” Considering how confident and slick   is, the line serves as both a fitting mission statement and palpable modus operandi. At 12 songs and 29 minutes, Stern’s fifth album is arguably her most focused, leaving very little room either to breathe or fully absorb the sounds flying by our ears and eyes. That goes for everything from the hypnotic vocal hooks and wildly expressive call-and-response chords of “Earth Eater” to the prickly, borderline power ballad progressions of “Til It’s Over.” Stern even puts her own personal stamp on   with an infectious rendition of the chorus line composition “Il Girotondo Della Note” that sounds as if it were beamed from a bouncy castle on Mars. Which kinda explains the album’s comic book-ish cover;  isn’t just a reminder of Stern’s roots and the revved-up records she’s yet to write.

On debut album  , New York-based ambient composer and sound artist Asha Sheshadri creates pieces that embody this feeling.  liner notes state that the tracks were “arranged & recorded… in bedrooms, living rooms, libraries, bars, airplanes, backyards and parks across North America,” but although this might suggest familiarity or even domesticity, the sonic flotsam and jetsam (including white noise, overlapping conversations, rustling, nondescript electronic beeping) is paired with enigmatic spoken word parts, both becoming headier and stranger by their proximity to one another. If you’ve ever been moved by a strange exhibition in an art gallery, but you’re quite not sure why, then this album is for you. Listening to   we never quite get an answer. Sheshadri seems to delight in creating pieces that are somehow just out of reach. Is that the sound of a church bell tolling beneath layers of electronic processing on “I Know, You’re Cold”? What are those chewed-up textures on “Stimulus Progression” that seem forever crumpling in on themselves? The spoken word samples on “Irreplaceable” are cut off by blasts of mechanical whirring before they can get to any real meaning: “my current art practice relies primarily on the plundering and interpretation of th— in order to represent—.” In the liner notes, Sheshadri also explains that   evokes “a refracted ambivalence towards what was once real, the endless cycle of reckoning with wherever ‘home’ has taken place.” The church bells on “I Know You’re Cold” were “once real” but are now saturated with a heavy flanging effect and overlaid with the sound of running water, foregrounding a free-flowing narrative. The piano—an instrument often associated with domestic, homey spaces—on “Whiplash,” “Shipwreck,” “Stimulus Progression,” and “Looting Index” is distressed and detuned until it sounds ghostly and fragile. The specificity of the lyrics—“flying over middle America on a plane seat without a retractable tray” on “A Holding Pattern,” or “the North Country Fair Mall at the particular time of day when it feels like a ghost mall inside and it’s sweltering outside” on album highlight “Some Places to Find Quiet and Peace”—suggests how transitory the temporary homes of “bedrooms, living rooms, libraries” or plane seats, for all their immediate realness, really are. It’s notable that the vocal samples, sourced from “video work, excerpts from writers…recovered and recycled voice/text memos,” used by Sheshadri often seem to be from supporting characters in a story rather than main ones (“Supporting Characters” is even a song title on  ): someone reminds a friend of their personal growth, a woman memorializes her mother, a documentary-style voiceover explains part of a musician’s oeuvre. Many are reminiscent of short stories by Breece D’J Pancake or Miranda July, where one vital piece of information seems to hover, specter-like, over the narrative but is never explicitly mentioned. It’s in these spaces between meaning, though, that this strange and lovely album calls home.

The introduction of rap studio recordings changed the nature of the craft itself. By releasing itself from the sole proprietorship of the party, rap music opened up a little more space for artists to mine a new introspective sensibility.  , the latest album from East Cleveland-born rapper and producer Kipp Stone, is as introspective and conflicted as it gets. Written and recorded solely by Stone, the album offers an in-depth exploration of the artist’s rich internal world. The album opens with “BLVD Intro,” a gorgeous tune built around a subtle, mid-tempo beat and smooth vocal harmonies. Stone enters at the song’s midway point with a verse full of longing, both romantic and financial. His pen straddles the line between confident and self-pitying as he hits us with bombshell lines like “Shit you hate about yourself, be what they love you for the most.” “Petrichor” is built around dreamy keys and a slow rhythm section. Stone opens up fully, putting his shortcomings, insecurities, hopes, and ambitions on full display. It’s an interesting contrast to a song like “Vanderhall Venice,” a breezy, optimistic tune in which Stone confesses, “I ain’t felt this free in all my life.” ’s production is handled by a cadre of producers, including Tunga,  , Endless, BeatsByEmani, Mides, eeryskies,  , Stoic, and Kipp himself. Despite this by-committee approach, the music throughout the album has a consistent aesthetic: soulful keys and groovy drums and basslines. This low-key sound perfectly supports Stone’s catchy, emotionally wrought songs.   pulls us through a rollercoaster of anger, genuine sadness, and triumph, and ultimately we emerge from the other side richer having experienced it.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kipp-stone-66689-blvd-review"}

The tools we employ to make and manipulate sound have always come with higher stakes. By nature of the sociopolitical context in which Black music exists, the music that we make requires a liberatory imperative. The work of musician/theorist DeForrest Brown Jr. (aka  ) is grounded in Black liberation praxis while questioning what liberation looks like and how music serves that aim. On his previous album, 2020’s  , Brown used his dynamic Detroit techno and ambient-influenced compositions to posit Black music itself as a liberation technology. Brown builds on that premise with his latest album,  .  opens with “D.T.A.W.O. (Deprogramming The Atonist World Order).” Amidst a dreamy, looping synth, Brown appears to state a direct but novel mission statement: “Black music that sounds technological rather than music made with technology.” By focusing on the technological character of Black music, Brown aligns himself with a long continuum of Black artists and thinkers like Octavia Butler, Sun Ra, and more who channel speculative art into a revolutionary creative practice. As the track’s intensity builds, pillowy kick drums echo through the soundscape creating a faint cardiovascular-like rhythm. “Techno-Vernacular Phreak” comes next with syncopated kicks, snares, and toms that call to mind the complex drumming language of jazz. “Holosonic Rebellion” opens with skittering hi-hats supporting a drifting ambient soundscape. The music here builds patiently as sounds are allowed to enter and recede without hurry. A handful of samples point to the thematic content of “Holosonic Rebellion” as screams, crashes, and conflict help narrate the sound of a violent uprising. As part of the cultural lifeblood of Black people, Black music has always been a key tool in our collective fight on multiple fronts. Myth, spirit, politics, culture, aesthetics and beyond, the Black experience worldwide is characterized by an ongoing fight for survival, dignity, and freedom.   presents us with a soundtrack for this struggle as well as an intellectual framework which we can use to contemplate our relationship to technology and the future.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/speaker-music-techxodus-review"}

At times, it reaches Hawthorne Heights levels of screamo sincerity, as on “you betrayed the ones you loved.” Elsewhere, featured artists including   help Blind Equation plumb the depths of depression over synth squalls that approach 250bpm.

Closer “the last glimpse of me” doesn’t dip into grindcore textures until toward the end and clocks in at nearly five minutes. Rather than compressing their emotions into bricked-out, sub-two-minute compositions, Blind Equation seem more willing to ruminate. That expansiveness shows up in the lyrics and vocals. James McHenry’s fatalistic songwriting builds on the precedents he set on 2021’s  contains more cleans, more grand washes behind the freakout melodies, more big feels. Blind Equation clearly appreciate the similarity between the conditions in which screamo initially thrived and today: fragile identity, digital anxiety, a resurgence of hate, rampant uncertainty. “Life passes by me at light speed/ As I watch it consume me/ Never the person that I truly want to be/ And I’ll die not ever knowing me,” McHenry shrieks on “speedrunning life.” It’s clear Blind Equation appreciate the ways information overload impacts not just our relationship to culture, but our relationship to ourselves. The faces may have changed, but the hassles are just the same—like   25 years on,  presents contemporary life as an almost insurmountable challenge, but a fun one to take on nonetheless.

Though still in their infancy, film and radio were transforming into commercial industries by the first decade of the 1900s. The recording industry, too, was crystallizing during these critical years. The gramophone—an early version of the record player which improved upon Thomas Edison’s phonograph—became a mass-produced item that ordinary folks could obtain. Recording equipment became more practical and more portable, allowing engineers to travel the world and capture live music. These two developments in tandem meant you no longer had to be in the room with musicians to hear them play; music could come from anywhere and be heard everywhere. As record dealers spread out across the Caribbean islands and explored the possibilities of this new medium, they found a diversity of music around every corner.  collects a small fraction of the sounds sealed in shellac during this frenzy, reissuing most of them for the first time since their original issue over a century ago. Many of the songs on this compilation tell stories that immortalize ephemeral moments. Coro Chambelona’s “Son de la Chambelona” manifested from one of Cuba’s first political protest songs, written by opponents of conservative president Mario García Menocal during the 1916 election season. The original “La Chambelona” brutally mocked the divisive leader, but Victor Records took the unusual step of requesting the political lyrics be omitted so that the record would still be marketable in the event of Menocal winning re-election. (He did win.) In their place, an improvised bugle riff and a percussion suite of repurposed gardening tools give it a unique slapdash charm. The song eventually shed its political baggage and remains one of the most popular Cuban congas. The musicians represented on   also vary in levels of fame. Lionel Belasco is a monumentally important figure in the history of music from the West Indies. A pioneering   and ambassador for the then-young genre, he traveled the Caribbean extensively, adding tunes from all over the islands to his repertoire and popularizing them internationally. This version of “Buddy Abraham” was chronicled during a stay in New York City that he decided to make permanent; he would continue playing Caribbean music in the United States for the rest of his life. By contrast, little information remains about the performers of “Las Vacaciones.” The notes accompanying the session label it a   (school song), and it does appear to feature a choir of young students, possibly accompanied by teachers on piano and violin. The circumstances of the amateur recording from San Juan have mostly eroded to time, but still hold precious details of Caribbean music history. Record labels were still a brave new world when these early Caribbean recordings were pressed; engineers didn’t have the benefit of sales and marketing information to guide their choices, resulting in a surprisingly comprehensive survey of the local music of a disparate geographical area. The activity of labels around this time could be considered an early musicological event, but the science was imperfect and marred by motives of profit; context was often stripped from the final product. (“Bagai Sala que Pochery Moin,” for example, was retitled to the less descriptive “Native Trinidad Kalenda” by Victor.)   does its part to correct the historical record, reuniting the stories with the music.", "genre": ["World"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-con-piano-sublime-early-recordings-from-the-caribbean-review"}

After all, her early work in  ’s Guardian Alien project often felt like a frantic séance or a one-way ticket on a bullet train to pure transcendence (see: their   and the side-long title track sequences of  ). Eartheater’s opening salvos for Hausu Mountain (2015’s   and  ) were also wild and otherworldly, but listen closely, and you’ll hear how they hint at the heavenly vocal hooks to come. The clearest dot-connector for  is probably 2019’s  , a fantastical mixtape that quickly became a cult favorite. It was the first time Eartheater let outside producers like  ,   and   past the pearly gates of her self-made sound world for an entire album. Listen to it alongside Eartheater’s subsequent albums (  and its calming director’s cut  ) and everything Eartheater has been working towards over the past decade starts to make perfect sense. Namely her ever-evolving vision of what truly experimental pop tracks should sound like—a feeling reinforced by  ’ initial sessions at LA’s illustrious Sunset Sound recording studio. To give you an idea of how storied its CV is, parts of   and   were both recorded there. Not to mention   hit “Let It Go,” and the audio side of such Disney movies as  and  . The latter is actually interpolated on  ’ speaker-panning opener “Sugarcane Switch.” As strings rise with the tides of a lumbering bass line and palpitating drums, Eartheater sings about how “a spoonful of sugar” can “help the medicine go down on me.” Her sly turn of phrase is more than a mere homage to Hollywood’s favorite housekeeper; it’s a telling sign of the scientific, and metaphorical, symbolism that lurks just beneath the album’s surface. Or as she put it in a press release, “  is a series of vignettes about the process of breaking things down. Once a substance is ground down to powder, it’s in its tiniest molecular state, enabling it to then be integrated into something new.” Musically speaking,  finds much of its power in minimalism and making every last sound count. Striking a perfect balance between her orchestral side (the LEYA collab  , the avant-garde chamber arrangements of  , the   she composed for   in 2019) and strengths as a singer, songwriter, and producer, its nine songs were sanded and polished at several different studios with the help of such close friends and collaborators as  ,   and  . Not that you’d notice;  is an incredibly cohesive listen despite its moving parts and myriad co-producers. One reason may be Eartheater’s tendency to reconcile her past with her present, whether that means cutting a devastating System of a Down cover (“Chop Suey,” something she covered with an acoustic guitar in high school) or melding a rusty iPhone recording of her family playing mandolin, guitar and violin with cloudy effects and woozy vocals (“Salt of the Earth [H2ome]”). Centering its hi-def sound on slick breaks (“Crushing”), ecstatic choruses (“Pure Smile Snake Venom”) and woofer-wrecking rhythms (“Powder”) certainly doesn’t hurt either. Ask Eartheater to sum everything up with a sentence and she’ll tell you   is her “LA record”. That’s selling it short, though.

That fluid, boundry-less approach is very much in her wheelhouse. Her charging debut   reflected her early hears playing DIY house shows, while her soul-stirring follow-up  explored more mystical spaces. Both paired heady melodies with sage lyricism to create songs that hit right in the gut. Her latest album,  , is more playful experience, but no less profound. Co-produced by Tamko and Rostam (Batmanglij, formerly of Vampire Weekend), the first think you notice about  ’s is its lightness: Opener “Can I Talk My Shit,” begins with ethereal  ‘s against bright guitar, claves, and bird song before Tamko sings the question that gives the song its title. With lyrics like “You’re confessin’/ I’m undressin’” and “I am way too high for this,” the song sets the template for an album that is earnest without ever being self-serious. Throughout, Tamko pairs familiar Top 40 with spirited reflections on being present in the moment. Dreamy bop “Lexicon” is a bright entry into the “dance the night away” school of pop radio, Tamko blissfully declaring, “Our lexicon is gone when we dance all night” over glittering guitar and sizzling hi-hats. “Carpenter” combines Afrobeat rhythms and synth-pop production on track about understanding someone else’s perspective.  Tamko leads with the airier side of her rich voice on   but still leaves plenty of room for vocal experimentation—as on “Made Out with Your Best Friend,” where she sings over a patchwork of samples of her voice. On “Passing Me By,” she sings from the chest, voice pitched down, about riding the waves of life’s changes: “Lookin’ around to everyone that I know/ Passing me by in a street where we all used to be/ Comparing notes, checkin’ it twice/ Hopin’ I get somethin’ right while I’m still alive.” The lyrics gesture toward the album’s deeper theme of loss: It’s dedicated to musician Eric Littman, Tamko’s friend and collaborator, who died in 2021. As a whole,   invites to dance with joy, grief, and all the uncertainties in between. A refuge of lightness in the aftermath of dark times, it’s a testament to the value of taking each chapter of life as it comes.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/vagabon-sorry-i-havent-called-review"}

You’ll find them posted on telephone poles and stabbed into medians, planted by people who purchase them from insured folks who have extra to spare. The gray market for the strips is booming, sprouting lucrative cottage industries in nearly every city in the country. It’s as grim as it seems: Test strips can retail for more than $100 per box at drug stores, a price some simply can’t afford. By contrast, local or online vendors sell strips for pennies on the dollar—a bargain for the uninsured and a windfall for the shrewd. There’s a cynical take about the Can-Do American Entrepreneurial Spirit, that this is a legal way to eke out one’s own financial freedom without the headache of the job market. A realist will understand how this fully illustrates our cutthroat age, how medical care in this country is commodified, how the pain of the masses lines the pockets of the few. Though they named their new album  , it’s hard to imagine anyone accusing  —the New York rap duo comprised of   and  —of celebrating the system. Their last record, 2021’s  , a collaboration with legendary producer  , was a gorgeous, hypnotic examination of the axioms by which we define our existence. The new record is much grittier, a spiritual sequel to 2020’s  . That album laid bare the horrors of late capitalism, tracing its tendrils into the institutions of systemic racism, militarized police, and the perpetual policy choice of poverty.  examines how people are navigating this collapsing system: they thrive, they flail, they hustle, they die, they live. Survival is a completely disorienting experience, but woods and ELUCID understand just how to capture it. In one harrowing moment, woods describes leaving “four zips in the laundry,” only to return the next day to find his clothes clean and the work intact. The clerk gives him a hushed warning: “Papi, be careful.” On “Don’t Lose Your Job,” ELUCID laughs off any future plans he may have, sighing “I feel like I’ma buy life insurance and just die.” Woods feels paranoid about his newfound financial comfort, detailing how he hides cash in the walls in the last tense moments of “The Flexible Unreliability of Time and Memory.” ELUCID laments the near impossibility of feeling centered on “Supermooned,” exclaiming “What’s wrong with me doesn’t matter if you can’t do anything about it.” For such a dense and overwhelming piece of music, it’s remarkably cohesive—it’s clear there’s now an Armand Hammer sound. The duo’s corralled a stable of excellent producers that includes steadfast collaborators like  ,    , and  , but it’s  , who produces four collage-like pieces on the album, who truly sets the tone. Nothing stands still; beats switch minutes into songs, glitching distortion interrupts grooves; vibraphones, flutes, and synths slip around drums like smoke tendrils. It’s a lot to take in, but impossible to ignore. Everything feels like a snarl, teeth bared, ready to pounce. In a sampled phone call at the end of opener “Landlines,” a voice tells woods, “Life is basically tomorrow’s breakfast. If a lion wakes up in the morning, he knows to hunt a gazelle.” There’s a short pause, and then the voice concludes: “But I’m okay.”", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/armand-hammer-we-buy-diabetic-test-strips-review"}

Singer and guitarist Nic Gohl’s enigmatic—blank, even—lyrical statements such as “And when the trouble sets in” and “I heard the message” are contrasted by anthemic choruses like “It’s the right kind of rhythm” or “I am blinded/ I am seeing things.” These switch-ups make for moments on each song that wrongfoot you. “Build A Bridge” begins like a jerky post-punk banger but morphs into something more big-hearted, complete with falsetto singing and a brash, almost trance-y keyboard melody—maybe it sounds a bit like The Killers when Brandon Flowers wore a sneer and you fully appreciated why they were named after a  . It’s telling that Gohl glosses   as “pop music, basically.” This is not to say it lacks character or is particularly chorus-focused, but that it has pop music’s deftness, its immediacy. There might be a minor chord that seems to say “this is sad, and what of it?” or a brilliantly whistle-able melody. “Tele” has the feel of a long-lost Cult or Nine Inch Nails classic, while “Bite” begins as The Cure-by-numbers but soon opens up with the additions of a massed chorus of voices and beautiful, chiming guitar parts; “Pressure” is a wistful sonic goodbye-wave, the kind of thing that might soundtrack the denouement of a last-summer-of-freedom-type indie film.  is packed with this vein of Great Songs, Great Songs that boast melodies on which you could mortgage a speedboat—think The Cars, or XTC, or even TOY’s severely underrated 2016 third album   (which shares a similar sonic palette with  ).

None of this is a revelation, nor is it new. In fact, the “eating together” bit is particularly old, seeing how archaeologists keep digging up centuries-old taverns and public eateries in  ,  , and  . People need people, and people need to eat. Thus humanity keeps sitting down to dine together, the members of Blonde Redhead very much included. Not counting the 2016 early career compilation    is the band’s first record since 2014’s comparatively sparse   was met with mixed reviews, which is to say   whereas     is a proudly simple and deeply felt record, tying off the end of the group’s third decade with unobtrusive confidence and lilting, melodic dream pop balladry. Its origins stretch back to the malaise of pandemic lockdowns, of which communal dinner was an early casualty and a particularly tragic one considering the cultural backgrounds of Japan-born Kazu Makino and her Italian bandmates Amedeo and Simone Pace.  hangs together around its two-part centerpiece of a title track. The first part is an opaque vignette delivered at the top of Makino’s wispy register and the mix, held in place by a hollowed-out metronome-steady beat. The second part picks up the pace and lifts a lyric—“Sit down for dinner/ And the life as you know it ends”—from  Joan Didion’s chronicle of grieving her husband’s sudden death. Everything here feels pared-down, more so than usual, or at least more so than previous shined-up and electropop-adjacent outings   and  . “Rest of Her Life” is just vocals, simple strums, and ambient babbling brook and birdsong for effect. “Melody Experiment,” released as the second single, and “Before” are melancholia rock, bringing the band back within range of long-touted influences Sonic Youth. On occasion, they venture into territory that feels like   labelmate This Mortal Coil with the gothic drama turned down. Eventually, Makuno and Pace grow tired of talking about their feelings, and the record ends with “Via Savona,” an almost entirely instrumental epilogue—there are some light vocalizations from Makuno, but no words—named for a street in the Pace brother’s native Milan. It’s a pulsing, beautiful, and fitting end to a record rooted in and striving for soft communal feeling. After all, if there’s one thing nearly as old as humans eating together, it’s humans making noise together.

Like Dolores O’Riordan or Sinéad O’Connor, the vocal performances of Nur Wahidah, the singer of  , are often characterized by brief jumps from alto to falsetto, from chest to head. They’re a nice way into Subsonic Eye (and their new album,  ) who do their best to sound reserved and chilly (all clean lines and choppy rhythms) but can’t help themselves from occasionally breaking out into something more tender. Although the group’s third album,  , detailed the “natural world fast disappearing,” on  , they decided to explore nature’s co-existence with “urban cities.” It’s easy to see how this has translated into the songs, which seem built from glass, metal, poured concrete, and polished stone. The production sounds almost steam-cleaned—there’s the transparency of math rock, the flat arrangement style of dream pop, and dry, metallic guitar sounds borrowed from post-rock. There’s a certain opacity to tracks like “J-O-B” and “Machine”; they’re slippery and difficult to judge the emotional tenor of. The breathlessness of “Circle” and “Performative” (the latter a contender for one of the tracks of the year—it’s  ) conjures the feel of cars rushing around junctions or streets bustling with people. These songs whirl and flurry, but never quite settle. The album is not totally impenetrable, though. Wahidah acts as a kind of tour guide to millennial life in the big city, uninterestedly discussing “charging laptops, ticking boxes,” yoga, or capitalism; sometimes her singing might dissolve into muffled unintelligibility, like she just can’t be bothered to be heard above the metropolis’ industrial roar. Furthermore, brief moments of respite—like a pretty chord change; a glowing, liquid guitar line; or a yodeling voice crack—can also throw an entire song into relief, like the sun peeking through clouds onto a skyscraper and making you notice, however momentarily, the powerful curves, the mosaic-like glass, and the tiny people inside.", "genre": ["Alternative", "dream pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/subsonic-eye-all-around-you-review"}

In  , you might hear traces of Four Tet’s crisp folktronica, Craven Faults’ widescreen atmospherics, or even Drexciya’s pulsing, aquatic-themed electro. In  , you can just about sense in embryo new forms of switched-on music yet to come, clamoring to be heard. Circus Underwater were a Maryland duo made up of Richard Sales and Jay Yarnall. Initially Dead Heads and hippies, in the early 1980s they applied the sonic boundary-pushing attitude of the 1960s to the new possibilities offered by the developments in electronic synthesis. (This is a leap that many in the 1960s failed to make). The result was a collection of pieces that meld futuristic drum machines, synthesizers, and electronic textures with the heady pulse of prog and the organic rattle and roll of American primitive guitar. Imagine Bobby Frank Brown being produced by Tangerine Dream, and you’re halfway there. The through line between this confluence of sounds is a sense of the hypnotic. Whether it’s the droning synths on “Entrance of the Deacon”, or the spiraling guitars on “Thunder Daughters Underwater”, or even the depths of reverb on “Weeping of Electric Sheep”, Circus Underwater create immersive worlds that slowly pull you under—after all, things only swim into view when you submerge yourself completely. The most tantalizing track here is “The Surface Of The Water”. A dub odyssey with cascading, Beach Boys-esque harmonies, fathoms-deep bass, and a gentle, almost aching wistfulness, it’s probably the best thing on here, and offers a tantalizing glimpse of what a vocal-led album might sound like. Sadly, we’ll never know. Circus Underwater ceased to be after the release of their debut. Although this music might, to us in 2023, seem chunky and old and lovely, like a boxy television that needs a minute to warm up, with exposed diodes and resistors and a big, saturated, technicolor screen, for those select few who were listening in 1984,   might just have sounded like the future.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/circus-underwater-circus-underwater"}

Its grip on time is tenuous at best. It’s wildly self-conscious, charmingly scatterbrained, and constantly slipping between numbness and intense feeling.

Most of the songs on   feel like self-contained emotional snapshots. Sometimes Jaime is observational, sometimes they’re deeply personal, and sometimes they’re both. They tearfully watch a friend detach completely on “Girls On SSRIs Dont Cry,” lamenting, “You don’t even know how to feel/ Girl, please let down your shield.” (True to their L.A. roots, the accompanying video is shot in the Rite Aid parking lot off Eagle Rock Boulevard.) Throughout the record, Jaime looks backwards and forwards, wishes for second chances, and asks to start again.

Prior to his passing in May 1990, Eastman mostly toiled in obscurity, under-recognized and underpaid, composing his quirky, evocative sounds in obscurity. It’s no wonder Eastman’s work resonated with James. Although both musicians’ Blackness and queerness are expressed in their work in different ways, James treated Eastman’s work with thoughtfulness and care, highlighting a beautiful kinship between these two Black, queer, and experimental artists. For her latest album,  , James reflects on her Blackness and queerness through the lens of her adolescence. The album’s premise is simple and novel: James revisits her early influences to make a record she would’ve made as a teenager. James takes the disparate sounds of drum & bass, techno, R&B, and pop and puts them in a blender, emerging with a rich set of complex, leftfield electronica. The title track, “Gentle Confrontation,” sets the tone—it’s a grand, sweeping overture. With its shredded guitar break and sweeping synth strings, the title track occupies a similar musical landscape as Goldie and Diane Charlemange’s 1994 drum & bass opus, “Inner City Life.” James’s detached, monotone chant, “I feel very tired, I feel very bored,” adds a playful, human element. On “2003,” James revisits the death of her father. Backed by a hazy, drumless cloud of ambiance, she sings about the confusion and uncertainty that comes with losing a parent at a young age. The song’s lilting, bittersweet melody perfectly articulates the heavy sadness of early trauma that can follow a child into adulthood. With songs like “Cards with Grandparents,” “Let U Go” (feat.  ), and “Saying Goodbye” (feat.  ),   finds James and her collaborators wrestling with the past and the loss that comes with moving forward. Despite its constant engagement with the past, the album is not nostalgic as much as it is reflective. Childhood and adolescence are universal experiences, but the racial, gendered, sexual, and class variations in our identities are part of what makes those experiences more unique. By reckoning with her past through fresh eyes and ears, James offers her younger self the same kind of care and respect she once offered Eastman. And in a world designed to stamp out our brilliant, Black, queer kin, and their specific type of genius, this kind of care and respect is essential for our future.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/loraine-james-gentle-confrontation-review"}

In New Orleans, Africans were allowed to retain the complex musical traditions they brought over the Atlantic and inject an African sound into an American musical and social context. Adjuah’s new album  gives us a glimpse of what a free, forward-looking Black musical form can be. With his voice and a self-designed electric bow/harp at the forefront, the music on  is deeply rooted in African tradition and unfettered by the constraints of any Western concept of genre. The hypnotic opener “Blood Calls Blood” is followed by “Trouble That Mornin’,” a tune where propulsive hand drumming anchors soaring vocals. Here, the song’s lyrics remind listeners that it has been 500 years since the onset of colonialism and the slave trade while evoking the names of the Yoruba   Shango and Yemaya. “On To New Orleans (Runnin’ in 7s Redux)” strips things down to the core with a complex mixture of percussion elements that display African drumming in all its orchestral glory. A powerful melding of West African and Black American sensibilities,  speaks to the multitudinous nature of our diaspora. Both the blues and jazz live inside these songs while Malian   music whispers throughout like a distant memory. Although fully grounded in the past, this is a daring contemporary work that reminds us of all the things that our ancestors cherished and kept safe for us to have in the future.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/chief-adjuah-bark-out-thunder-roar-out-lightning-review"}

Only their third release,  is the debut from Cairo painter and producer Fajr Soliman (aka El Kontessa). With its collaged approach to experimental dance music—overlapping global club beats with traditional   rhythms and hairline-fracture glitches—the record places Soliman firmly in the pantheon of Cairo’s innovative music scene. What distinguishes Soliman from contemporaries like   and  , however, is her maximalist style. Like her wildly colorful visual artwork, some of which adorns the album’s cover, she packs as many ideas into each track as she can, never quite sticking to one groove, texture, tempo, or melody. Yet it’s not at the expense of danceability, informed as much by electronic experimentation as by tried-and-true rhythms from Jersey club to  . One only needs to listen to “Ghaltet Meen غلطة مين” (Who is to blame?) to understand Soliman’s M.O. here. Sampling a famous political     by Shafiqa شفيقة, Soliman throws its key elements—string flourishes, aching vocals, and a driving   rhythm—into a blender, reconstructing it as an electronic anthem. Coming in like a truck with a heavy kick and dubstep-esque bass weight at about 120 BPM, flighty strings signal for the first BPM change of many, bumping things up to 160 as a sparse, oddball beat shapeshifts alongside vocal irruptions and darbuka rolls. There’s another tempo rupture, and then the kicks turn into a blistering 4×4, trading blows with darbuka and the titular refrain before returning to a bit of traditional rhythms with what sounds like a variation on  . Things slow down again, low synths droning on alongside a flurry of samples; when it’s time for the finale, Soliman kicks it back up with bursts of kicks and tambourine structured around a central dembow (if you tilt your ears another way, you might hear   or  as well). It’s a hell of a track, and every listen reveals new sonic epiphanies. Other tracks here are just as inventive. “Bingo” opens with a blend between Jersey kicks and  , before introducing a series of ominous sawtooth and metallophone synths. “Mesh Marshmallow” is all aquatic immersion, the syncopated synth line weaving in and out of a maqsoum rhythm; later, the beat gets front-loaded, with sub-heavy kicks taking the lead alongside warbling synth. And just when you think she’s decided to end things slowly with a hip-hop flip of the   (1970)  , Soliman suddenly goes double time with a breakcore breakdown in closing track “Asanser.” Packing all of this into an under-30 minute total runtime,   نص ح​ب​ة ك​ر​ا​م​ي​ل is a whirlwind of a debut.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/el-kontessa-nos-habet-caramel-review"}

Over Williams’s airy, gospel, and soul-informed beats, Sharif patiently recited a string of apparently disconnected phrases—from “Arsenic”: “ , sickening/ Missing moment/ Spit appointment, twisting/ Mystic currents”—that when taken together, form a loose mosaic-like picture. Over the last two years, his music has grown steadily darker: 2022’s  , a collaboration with noface released by the experimental label   channeled the same sense of dread as the horror movies Sharif loves. (Sharif is a cinephile in general; to read any interview is to end up adding five or ten titles to your Letterboxed Watchlist.) On that release, noface’s production sounded like it was perennially creeping up behind Sharif, ghostly and chilling; the rapper’s bars, clipped and list-like, functioned less as rhymes than as demonic incantations (“Past dreams where I’m last seen/ Held vaccine/ Cronenberg’s last scene/ War world   got  y award.”) Sharif’s plunge into darkness continues on  , his latest—and arguably strongest—record, and his first for billy woods’s  . This time with   manning the boards, Sharif conjures nightmare after nightmare, all of them delivered one quick glimpse at a time—like you’re catching sight of terrifying figures from the window of a speeding train at night. Sharif has always had chemistry with his producers, but the symbiosis between him and Dove has brought out the best in both of them. On “East Hollywood,” Dove’s production is all dripping pipes, creaking floorboards, and grim piano, and Sharif matches the mood from the jump: “Cloned reptilians murder at 1600/ …Sunrise thesis/ The apartheid seamstress/ Hawkeye, float over sky, fungi fetus.” Throughout, Sharif uses his voice as another instrument in the canvas, plunging it down to the deepest reaches of his register, or doubling and tripling it so there’s one Sharif delivering the lines in rumbling low tones while others wail out the same words in a panicked tone above. This produces a deeply disconcerting effect on “Dimethyltryptamine.” Dove’s production is barely there at all, just a sluggish beat and some groaning industrial tones as the two Sharifs—one composed and determined, the other utterly freaked out—glide hauntingly through the empty air. To try to make literal sense of   is to miss the point. Sharif is trying to give you the   of something, not spell everything out in plain English.

It sounds like Silicone Prairie sole proprietor Ian Teeple (you may know him from   or  ), accompanied by friends from the Kansas City, Missouri punk/indie rock scene, is having a ton of fun playing these tunes.

There’s “Willkommen,” an ambient interlude with AI-like German spoken word—that voice circles back to end the album as well. There’s 20 seconds of dissonant warbling at the end of “Cows.” There’s the wavy synth of “Freed’s Wet Tape.” Or perhaps those juxtapositions of sound instead help establish the heterogeneity of the record—one where flute solos coexist with skronky kazoo sounds and lyrics about hating the U.S. (The smooth “Neon Moon” sounds like   singing a bizarro version of   theme song.) While this record fits well into the   roster, it wouldn’t be out of place among the dreamy twee acts on   or the broadly experimental DIY artists on  .

Many of the record’s 11 tracks use a simple mix of mid-tempo drum machine beats and sparkly synths to create constellations of sound. It’s as if Mascelli made these pieces while lying down in a field late at night, staring at the sky. Take the plainly-titled “Everyday Life”; small waves and whirrs gradually surround the slow keyboard line, as Mascelli travels the spaceways in a manner not far from Flaming Lips’s Pink Floyd-inspired journeys. But   is more than just a celestial trip. That’s because Mascelli balances his outward excursions with poignant, beautifully-sung ballads. “Everyday Life” is followed by “Happy Hour,” a solemn meditation over a simple rising drone. Even more stirring is the way Mascelli begins the album. After trekking through the blippy, hypnotic “The Gateway,” a  -styled Space Age instrumental, he delivers the resonant “History,” in which his voice rises and falls alongside plaintive piano chords. It’s certainly no coincidence that the album’s most moving piece is a cover of a Judee Sill tune called “Lopin’ Along Thru the Cosmos.” The fact that this comes right before songs with names such as “Interior Castle” and “Mind War” suggests that for Mascelli, human emotions are as spellbinding as the universe’s outer limits. As he puts it in the album notes, he’s “exploring ways people try to make sense of an insane world”—a quest as applicable to our inner spaces as to the world around us. All of this may make   sound pretty heavy, and it often is. But Mascelli traverses a wide range of moods throughout the album, and what sounds dark or probing can also feel uplifting and even sunny, especially since he’s partial to tones that rise toward the sky. The best example is “Macrocosm,” perhaps the only song here you could call fully upbeat. Over a sprightly rhythm, the bright synth line evokes a lost 1980s pop hit just waiting for someone to croon over top of it.  closes with “Psychic Surgery,” a title that could be read as a nod to Mascelli’s previous solo project,  . It’s the album’s densest track, a pool of deep, tactile tones in which Mascelli’s voice swims like an alien, processed and drenched in the encompassing drone. It’s like he’s become a disembodied spirit crossed over to some other side, which   suggests is not such a bad place to be.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ruth-mascelli-non-stop-healing-frequency-review"}

Seventeen years ago, DJs  ,  , Jesse, Pausas,   and   blazed a new trail in Portuguese music as DJs Di Guetto. Indeed, Príncipe’s foundation was laid by the African diaspora’s commitment to dance music, Detroit ghettotech fusing with Angolan   to create something that is new and simultaneously familiar. There is no room for filler on   Samples and melodies abound but it is singularly minimal music, designed for dancing, not studying. DJ Marfox’s “Drift Furioso” strips the Teriyaki Boyz’ song to its bare bones, ridding it of the original synths, ad-libs, and vocals until the sped-up drums compel your feet to move. And despite how stripped down these tracks are, they all feel unique in their visions, flitting from “Estrago Terrivel”’s wild klaxons to “Tapada”’s woozy riddim. This is first and foremost body music, the kind that makes you move your shoulders, shake your hips, and bob your head. “Isto é Kazu Bite” typifies this concept; grimy synths gloriously aid drums that sound  , as though they’re playing themselves instead of being programmed. But the next track, “Techno” by DJ Jesse, flips the danceability factor on its head. Instead of the chaotic elements we’ve become accustomed to over the compilation, Jesse parallels The Field’s minimal techno repetition. Only three minutes in, he pulls another about-face and cranks the syncopation to 11, disregarding the synths entirely. Axel Willner couldn’t have done it better. Though this re-release entails only 11 tracks, the original compilation has 37 tracks all worth your time. Príncipe staked its existence on this group of DJs, and that leap of faith has majorly benefitted the global music community who’d have never heard this through conventional channels. Its simplicity is its calling card and its genius, a lesson to not overcomplicate things and keep it lean, lest it get stale.   is real ghetto shit, held in the highest possible regard.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/djs-di-guetto-self-titled-review"}

The vocals are front and center with a sweet but raw cadence. This song feels akin to the group’s early sounds. The second single, “Thing I Put Together,” has more of a sludgy, dirge-y 90’s thing happening with personal lyrics, almost like it’s Bush Tetras’s take on an Alice In Chains or Hole song. Title track “They Live in My Head” starts with an off-kilter twangy acoustic guitar and is soon accompanied by a full band, building into the sped-up chorus which is honestly catchy as hell. This one feels like a mad mix of a   song and a Jim Carroll Band tune, an homage to classic punk. The tempo is a little bipolar, but it fits the song. The rest of the album follows suit, a mixed bag of styles and sounds, as if the band members are simultaneously relearning and reinventing who they are together as Bush Tetras.

That includes the cover, with its bygone paparazzi-style snap of the trio emerging from a basement club, drinks still in hand. It’s vintage down to the film grain and the hip-hugging plaid flares. Besides these frequent gestures to Chic and Sylvester, more contemporary influences seep into  well. There are HAIM-style harmonies on “Easy” and “Hold Tight,” plus enough burning synthpop desire on “Up” that it wouldn’t feel out of place in ’s catalog. “Everybody’s Saying That” approaches -levels of Casio sleaze, as does the vocoder-drenched album closer “Give Me Your Love.” The combined effect propels them into   and   territory; this is music for sashaying together in St. Tropez, as opposed to making out in the bathroom at Berghain or behind the South London warehouse at an illegal rave.

First among them? The near-immutability of the sub-subgenre known as D-beat. Sure, you might have the wild alpha and omega of stadium crust and noise punk, but bar the occasional rock ‘n’ roll injection or black metal dalliance, D-beat largely continues to offer the uniformity of sound, vision, and aesthetic you might expect from a style that originates not just from one band, but one drum beat.

Dig deeper in Cleveland and within its adjacent environment at that time, and you would have found a semi-clandestine landscape: a vibrant, community-driven, and fiercely DIY movement blowing the lids off basements and community spaces with a primal hybrid of hardcore and indie rock.

One of these bands was  , who developed their gloriously icky, clearly Washington, D.C.-influenced post-hardcore sound with the purely practical ethos of DIY punks worldwide: cut a bunch of 7-inches on the cheap and drop tracks on   while embracing the “get in the van” style of touring.

His mesmeric pieces seem to tap into a continuous stream of sound waiting out there in the ether. Perhaps that’s why it’s surprising that   represents his first new release with his Orchestra of Excited Strings in over 20 years. For anyone who’s gotten hooked by the power of Dreyblatt’s work, this is music that feels as if it’s essentially omnipresent, always ready to be played and listened to again. That sense of permanence is due in part to the ongoing excavation of Dreyblatt’s oeuvre over the past several decades by way of reissues and archival recordings, most recently a stunning   with   and   released earlier this year. But as an album driven by infinity,  ’s standalone strengths remain undeniable. Dreyblatt likes to establish a simple rhythm and let it swing away—adding small accents and overtones here and there, but mostly exploring what happens when things stay steady, solid, and strong. It’s an especially fruitful tactic when your humble “orchestra” includes experimental greats like   (aka Joerg Hiller),  , and  . Their consistent presence and skill, naturally, make for some consistent music. Though Dreyblatt’s compositional method is largely complex (his ensemble plays in 20 microtones per octave, changing key but keeping the same fundamental pitch), his songs have the hard-hitting simplicity of rock ‘n’ roll. Resolve opens with “Container,” a slow march that continually rises even when barely changing. The up-tempo stomp “Shuffle Effect” intoxicatingly melds rhythm and timbre into a single unit, the resonance of the strings buttressing the hypnotism of the beat. “Flight Path” deals in similar energy, but a rolling drum beat adds intensity, giving the orchestra intermittent sonic ramps from which to launch. The second side of   contains a single piece, the 17-minute meditation “Auditoria.” In contrast to the preceding tracks, rhythm is a ghost here, as strings are bowed into a multi-layered drone without any accompanying beat. Eventually, one string is struck repetitively, and everything gathers around this newfound metronome, turning “Auditoria” into another dazzling mix of sound and motion. Like most tracks on the album, it ends essentially in mid-stream, suggesting it could have continued forever.

If  and   explored her healing journey through highly textured, eclectic tracks on the downtempo side,   her most clearly club-oriented release to date. Juke and footwork are direct house descendants, a lineage Tomu DJ adheres to as she navigates the house musical genome from the ‘90s to the present day with elevated harmonic sensitivity and just the right amount of humor. The producer continues with the playful internet culture-adjacent in-song jokes that made her   stand out, with titles like “Mewsic,” a laidback 4×4 thumper with a quirked-up melody. Her use of expansive kick drums adds a weighty comfort to the tune, creating a cocooning feel. “Bedroom DJ” is perhaps the best example, Brooklyn rapper   adding an extra layer of unapologetic humor with lyrics like “Pop it twist it/ Flick my smash/ I like money/ Prefer cash” or the repeating chorus “I’m the bedroom DJ/ The real-life bedroom DJ/ You press rewind I replay.” Petty Getty’s chant-like rhymes, coupled with the crunchy acid snare drum make it more classically juke. “Band Man” is a psychedelic drum journey through sinewy, spaced-out synths and subdued drum & bass phrases, cycling towards a glitchy speedcore vocal sample. Moody “Crazy Trip” takes the early Tomu DJ approach of merging ethereal piano pads with restless synths, growing into a   beat sprinkled with drum & bass flourishes.

Over the past decade, the multi-hyphenate artist has explored queer love, loss, longing, and rage across eight albums, slipping in and out of genres with ease. On his ninth album,  , Shamir offers invigorating love songs draped in lush, pop-rock nostalgia. Channeling the addictive bounce of a bygone radio era—think everything from Third Eye Blind to The Cranberries—he deepens each track with thoughtful lyrics about complicated affection, both for self and others. Across them, Shamir makes a tender case for enduring the storms of self-discovery and connection. Part of that case comes from the album’s meditations on self-soothing and the wisdom that comes with them. Tried and true guitar pop compositions and fuzzy production drive the nostalgia while Shamir wields his trademark piccolo-like voice to build alternating waves of pathos and rapture. “Oversized Sweater,” a catchy tune about ending relationships, leads the way, delivering on the comfort its title promises. On it, Shamir observes and teaches, singing: “So I cuddle in the space of my oversized sweater and sing until I believe in love again. Some people last a week, last a month, or last a lifetime. You’ll never know how long they’ll stay ‘til the end.” Later, “Our Song” offers an edgier, distortion-heavy take on a similar theme with imagery straight from Gen X coming-of-age movies like   (1995) and   (2000). Using volume and dynamic vocal delivery to build intensity, Shamir highlights the romance in the angst of relationships past, singing, “I remember when you’d visit me just to see me one last time, ‘cause I lived above the record store and they play our song all the time.” At the same time, Shamir’s knack for slipping cheeky pop culture references throughout these meditations—such as when he remarks on “The Beginning,” “I wish I could turn back time, just like Cher”—reminds us that the task of living and learning can often be tongue in cheek. Though  is delightfully heavy in vintage pop traditions, it’s not one note. “Calloused,” a stripped-down folk dirge, laments how the world can deaden the spirit. Meanwhile, the album ends with “The Devil Said the Blues Is All I’ll Know,” a clear-cut blues song about being damned to earthly wretchedness. This variety and embrace of contradictions give  the clear-headed, gritty quality that made the heyday of ‘90s and ‘00s pop-punk and pop-rock so great.

Not only has sampling revived interest in old records, but it has also inspired contemporary musicians and listeners to carefully study how those records were made. The conceptual and technical leap required to snatch bits of recorded audio and use them as building blocks for new compositions has opened a Pandora’s box of sorts. Today, instrumentalists play with a samplist’s ear to connect the past with the present. The latest from producer Abderraouf B Grissa and producer/drummer   embodies the shift that sampling has ushered into modern music. Throughout   the duo’s groovy, texturally rich instrumentals combine jazz, hip-hop, dub, and experimental electronics in a way that could only happen in a post-sampling world. Throughout each of the album’s tracks, genre is traversed liberally and influences—both contemporary and historical—are twisted into something new and strange. The album’s opener, “Any Time, Man,” is a bass-heavy tune with thick drums and an odd vocal sample of a man promising to provide us with “the basics” needed for survival. Jarret Gilgore’s bright alto saxophone licks recede into the background almost as suddenly as they appear, and the tune’s dark, heady vibe would fit in perfectly next to the work of ‘90s beat experimentalist Spectre and his Wordsound label. “Theme” is a slick, head-nodding, jazz-funk tune with some lovely sax and electric piano. A series of ghostly vocal samples and a whistled melody act as a hook; Drohan’s drumming is tight and propulsive. “Lake Poe” is a dreamy tune where sax and acoustic guitar are processed through a delay effect to produce an oceanic wave of sound. Drohan’s drumming is jagged and irregular, in counterpoint to the looping, hypnotic groove created by the melodic instruments. With tracks like the booming hip-hop track “Paris 1958” and the blissful nine-minute epic “Kalimbient,”  is as adventurous as it is tasteful.

Isolation and limited infrastructure might go some way in explaining why someone making music as mind-blowing as Jantra has toiled in relative obscurity until now. He’s hailed as a hero within his own community but unknown even in broader Sudan. In his hometown of Gedarif, Jantra is known as the man behind the raucous “Jaglara” music, translated as “craziness,” the local sound which animates celebrations and gatherings for hours on end. All Jantra needs to whip up listeners into a frenzy is his trusty Yamaha keyboard, which has been modified by the “keyboard mechanics” of Khartoum market to reflect the tone of Sudanese music. Rather than playing concerts in a traditional sense he freestyles his melodies, live-producing his music based on his audience’s reaction. His approach is raw and minimal, but with only a handful of elements he is able to weave bombastic and endlessly transportive tunes that swirl around and around in a feat of true audio hypnotism. But when the team behind  —who have a track record of uncovering obscure sounds from the Horn of Africa, and most recently released the incredible  by Noori & His Dorpa Band from the Port of Sudan—started working on a record of Jantra’s music, his improvisational flair presented a dilemma.

The serene joyful atmosphere carries through on “Makhafi,” a slow burner where celestial pads quickly give way to synths that snake their around a robust, looping traditional rhythm.

He was born to a teen mom in the west Atlanta neighborhood of Adamsville, attended Frederick Douglass High School and Morehouse College, but eventually dropped out to become a drug dealer. He’d work on music on the side, using dope money to pay for recording equipment. Eventually, Big Boi of Outkast gave him a shot, inviting him to appear on their late career single, “The Whole World.” That song would go on to win a Grammy. Mike then partnered with T.I., releasing a string of well-received mixtapes with Grand Hustle, though none quite broke through to the mainstream. A friend at Adult Swim paired Mike with Def Jux rapper and producer El-P for what was supposed to be a couple of songs, but they got on so well the sessions turned into a full album, 2012’s  . That partnership became Run The Jewels, an indomitable, festival-headlining, arena-packing project that’s taken El-P and Mike to new heights of critical success and fame. Along the way, the 48-year-old rapper has become something of a polarizing figure. He’s never been shy about his politics, which don’t fit neatly into a particular category. Mike campaigned for Bernie Sanders in 2016 but has taken meetings with and spoken warmly of Georgia’s deeply conservative governor, Brian Kemp. His activism feels particularly focused on capitalism as a path to freedom, confusing some supporters who otherwise identify with his message of liberation. It’s a bit messy. , Killer Mike’s first solo album in over a decade, embraces and investigates that messiness. It’s a highly personal record; part origin story, part therapy session, and part love letter to his hometown. Across  ’s 54 intense minutes, Mike presents a complex portrait of himself, not shying away from anger, but trying to temper it with the wisdom that comes from living nearly half a century. He expresses conflicted feelings about abortion on “Slummer,” but recognizes that it was the best decision for him and his high-school girlfriend. The song is both warm and wistful but doesn’t display acrimony to anyone involved. Though he titles a song about the wreckage of addiction the somewhat insensitive “Something for Junkies,” he casts an empathetic eye on those who deal with the disease. Mike’s honesty is brutal, but it’s very human. The album isn’t all raw emotion, though. There are plenty of celebratory moments, like the Dungeon Family reunion of “Scientists & Engineers,” which features incredible performances from Andre 3000 and Future. Curren$y and 2 Chainz show up to flex on “Spaceship Views,” and the playful “Don’t Let The Devil” serves as a reminder of the chemistry that makes Run The Jewels so magnetic.   also   amazing; Mike reportedly spent nearly $500,000 on the album, and the pristine mixing and lush instrumentation are a joy to get lost in. Mike’s no stranger to making enormous music, but executive producer No ID helps guide it towards billowing Southern gospel rather than RTJ’s confrontational bombast. Mike describes the album as a “testimonial in church,” an acknowledgment that pain and struggle can lead us to ugly places. But more than anything,   is an acceptance of being a perpetual work in progress. The longer you live, the more you understand that your foibles are part of your character. You can grow, change, and reflect, but hopefully, you can get to a place where you feel you’re enough.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/killer-mike-michael-review"}

It still has a sophistication in its synthesizer selection, one that—on “Early Morning” in particular—pushes BusCrates closer to  ’s cerebral and ambient instrumental work as  . “The Control Center” heads west for a swinging G-funk bounce that nods to contemporary  —another artist who explores the symbiosis between rap and funk. Throughout   BusCrates seeks to bridge his origins as a hip-hop producer (which includes work for a then-unknown Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa) with his current identity as a funk DJ and producer who releases music on dance labels like   and  . BusCrates sees all the dots connecting throughout time, and on  he proves past and present can coexist. On “Four-Track Mind” it feels like BusCrates is trying to summon the Weather Report riff that Q-Tip flips on A Tribe Called Quest’s “Butter,” but he can’t quite find the notes. The result is all his own. But the life he’s truly concerned with on   is his own quiet station in Pittsburgh. BusCrates has long been the humble practitioner who kept to his home studio while collaborators who came up in his city, like Miller and Khalifa, achieved international success and planted mansions in sunnier locales.   is dedicated to the woodshed, the studio, the intimate fortress of solitude where ideas flow freely. “Internal Dialogue” sports a synth flourish that feels like sudden inspiration striking BusCrates as his fingertips dance across the keys. And while BusCrates might tour as a DJ in vinyl bars like   or go live on Twitch to 12,000 followers, his true self is in the lab, exploring the infinity of his creative mind.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/buscrates-control-center-review"}

Records that paid homage to early ’90s greats were in abundance, which fit the zeitgeist: Culture-war battles that had cooled raged once more; grunge-inspired fashions returned; blast beats, growls, and grimy guitars were  , baby. That initial boom spawned a broader revisiting of classic styles of extreme music. But even as the OSDM craze gives way to more subtlety and depth, some sounds remain evergreen. “Bolt Thrower” continues to trend on Twitter every so often, as old heads rediscover the classics and new fans spin records like   for the first time. The UK’s  , anchored by   alumnus Andrew Whale on drums, marries these old-school sensibilities with contemporary pugilism, and their inaugural full-length,  , contains the best of both worlds. Production plays a major role here. While today’s death metal tends to lean toward either self-conscious retro scuzz or an ultra-refined sheen,  opts for a “raw and unbridled” style without feeling like a self-conscious tribute to times gone by. Recorded in multiple countries,  still feels alive and immediate. It’s of a piece with the accidentally-on-purpose balanced production of many early death metal milestones. The songwriting also walks the line between familiar and fresh, aided by shapeshifting riffs from Mick Carey (also of Ireland’s  ). “Coarse Visions,” one of the album’s highlights, fades in with springy bass and thundering drums before Carey’s guitar boils over. “A Taste of Ichor” is another meaty helping of riffs that features some midtempo doom sections. Both clock in at around four minutes—not too short; not too long. These newer tracks build on what the band explored on their inaugural three-track EP,  . All three of those songs appear on  ; however, the restraint of Gord Olson’s production on the latter makes what had already been structurally sound compositions sound like classics by comparison. These digital recordings sound warmer, and put the churning guitar, Kieran Scott of  ‘s forceful vocals, and of course, the massive rhythm section, on an equal footing. The result is 38 minutes of timeless death metal.", "genre": ["Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/deathcollector-deaths-toll-review"}

He was a Black and gay composer, ignored by the institutions of his day, and died homeless in relative obscurity. It’s an absolute shame that Eastman’s radical art, which unapologetically centered his identity in ways rarely seen in the avant-garde classical world, languished for decades before the scribes of history finally deemed it foundational—but his career contained multitudes that have still not been fully explored. With Wild Up’s   of their anthology series showcasing the work of Julius Eastman, the Los Angeles ensemble strikes a tone of celebration rather than lament as they shine their spotlight in new corners of the composer’s vast repertoire. For their  , Wild Up focused on Eastman’s signature piece  , casting off a strong opening salvo by jamming their version with more kinetic energy than any other ensemble’s attempt.  , they turned their attention to underrepresented items in the catalog, addressing the uncertainty of scores that don’t have canonical readings by providing multiple versions. Now, in  , one of Eastman’s extant works appears for the first time in recorded form—  (1970), a vocal work composed to accompany a ballet.   is a multimedia epic, capturing the full extent of Eastman’s fascinations in a single sweep; it’s an opera, a dance, and an improvisational sound collage. Though the visual aspects of the work can’t be expressed in the recording, the drama is no less present. Musicians stomp and clap like thespians on a stage. A chorus of voices rise, haunting chants phase in and out, and foreboding strings billow underneath. Wild Up tackles more familiar pieces, too, infusing new life into the work with their own arrangements.   (1977) ups the unrelenting energy of Eastman’s own recording from the   compilation, combining stabs of brass with piercing shrieks and extended vocal techniques not present in the original score. Even more impressive is a stunning new rendition of   (1979), led by Devonté Hynes (aka  ) and Adam Tendler on dueling pianos.   is percussive and propulsive, demanding high physical stamina to play for a full 20 minutes. Here, the stress is doubled as the usual four lead instruments are cut down to two. However, the biggest curveball is the addition of a full chamber orchestra, instructed to improvise in response to the pianists. The normally rote, hypnotic piece is transformed into an evolving organism. Eastman’s sudden departure left us with a scattered body of work, few recordings, and no directives for what to do with it all. As historians, musicians, and listeners alike pick through what’s left, it’s up to each individual to take a principled stance on what his legacy means.

Thanks to the internet, artists can compete in the global sonic marketplace without the kind of patronage or “discovery” by European and North American musicians that characterized   of the ‘80s. In the case of South African amapiano, some of the earliest adopters were Afrobeats DJs in Nigeria and Ghana, who helped it gain a global foothold. As a result, more and more artists are forging their own sounds from a mixture of local and international vernacular. Leke Awoyinka aka   is the perfect example: Raised between Lagos and London, his songs combine influences from both Nigeria and the UK British not because of some premeditated “musical fusion,” but simply because it reflects his own life. On his second album,  , Awoyinka raps, chants, and sings in London slang and Yoruba, as his music touches on British jungle and broken beat; hip-hop, both classic and modern; classic  ; and more. But he’s not fusing these elements—he’s finding common ground and points of connection between them, mapping out a cultural space in which to act out his dramas. Sonically he’s a million miles away, but it’s philosophically similar to the way David Bowie pulled together his equal love of rock, soul, music hall, chanson, and Vegas schmaltz. Another crucial element is Awoyinka’s extraordinary production. Part of the way he’s able to make the myriad elements flow together is because of his love for a wide array of sounds—whether it’s a horn section, an ‘80s funk synth stab, a raw bleep, a cut-up breakbeat, or hefty hand percussion. The drums in particular sound absolutely stellar here—something that’s clearly on his mind given not just the album’s title, but also its lyrics: “I got drum money,” “I have a tom-tom heartbeat.” The songs go from total celebration to wry mischief to politicized anger and back, and from straight-up dancefloor anthems to deep, trip-hop–like poetic musings. The latter features prominently on the final stretch of the album; the contemplative atmosphere draws you deeper into Awoyinka’s world, making you wonder about the roller-coaster that’s led to this point, and making you want to play it all over again.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ekiti-sound-drum-money-review"}

This type of cultural diffusion informs the aesthetic contours of Taiwanese duo  , whose latest,   continues a syncretic project of merging psychedelia and ambient electronics with a local, if mobile, set of referents from pan-Asian myth and folk tradition. After a riff-heavy invocation on opening track “Mystery Death,”  picks up Mong Tong’s median sound: patient yet exploratory, effervescent, and elegantly structured. It coheres like a film soundtrack, consistent with the band’s  : a careful assemblage of music, design, and a crypto-Taoist dress code of stark black and white and red. The throughlines of   are rudimentary percussion, ritual repetition, and an affinity for the timbres and tempos of Southeast Asian folk music. It weaves thudding gamelan rhythms, percussively strummed   (a Thai/Lao lute), and street-level field recordings into otherwise mostly guitar- and synth-based compositions, to mesmeric effect. One of the most energetic and representative tracks is “Areca,” where a bright guitar trills quick triplets over a cutting synth stab before making way for a syncopated, constantly panning frame drum beat. A groggy melody takes the lead, eventually giving way to gamelan bells and vintage psych guitar flourishes. Many of the sonic elements across   have an underwater feel; key lead melodies or ambiguous vocal anchors, like the reverb-misted incantations on “Gold Earth,” are buried in the mix. Plastic, Casio-esque tones add a compelling retro touch to the sonic palette, as on “Mountain Pond,” where a fuzzy keyboard pounds out a layer of grit that balances the tranquil flute and clean pads that open the track. The cumulative result is enchantment, that out-of-time feeling engendered by the best psychedelic music. If there’s one moment when the spell is broken, it’s on penultimate track “Ghost Island.” Extensively sampling recordings of Hanoi Hannah—a North Vietnam radio personality  —“Ghost Island” counters Mong Tong’s sonic cocoon with grim exhortations: “G.I., your government has betrayed you…Your rich leaders grow richer while you die in the swamp, G.I.” The contrast is jarring, evoking a past proxy battle between imperialist powers to subtly hint at potential future conflict. But to assess   through the frame of geopolitics would be foolish. Lexical ambiguity is baked into the project: Mong Tong’s name is a derivation of their childhood nicknames, signifying different things in Chinese, Cantonese, and Burmese. Fittingly, the album ends with an inchoate chorus of voices frothing together like sea foam on “Rain Maker,” fading out for a full minute of silence before a brief coda ends the journey as cryptically as it began. is Mong Tong’s latest ticket to a sonic space that’s familiar yet otherworldly, a half-dreamt subtropical archipelago one senses they’re only beginning to map.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mong-tong-tao-fire-review"}

With their second album for the   label, the pointedly titled  , they achieve further heights of compelling power and serene beauty. The album’s first single, “Blood Quantum,” demonstrates that in and of itself. While Reed is primarily known for her guitar work, it starts with her on saxophone, introducing a core hook with the sudden introduction of her slow, deliberate riffing. Matched by Nehill’s drumming, it overwhelms and matches, but never quite entirely erases, with tones floating deep in the mix like revenants demanding the living notice and remember. This kind of skillful instrumental combination works well at many points throughout  , including the album’s longest track at nearly seven minutes, “Indignation,” with an impact of trapped energy trying to break free and reach for the sky. Their penchant for long-form metal aside, Reed and Nehill are equally adept at crafting haunting soundscapes on a radio-formatted (if not radio-friendly) scale. Three-minute salvos like “Derail” and the near-terrifying “Omnipotent” convey pure glowering thrills in concentrated form, dark and dramatic, but with their own sense of careful, deliberative punch and stomp in turn. On “Kingdom of Fear,” a previous guest on their work, poet , adds words that tap into both a sense of the natural wonder and power as well as the need for empathy and what it means when it is denied—as she says clearly at one point, not so much as warning as reckoning, “If I am denied/ The simple gentleness/ Of existing.” That’s  ’s methodology, in a way: pushing against the structural undercurrents suggested by the album title, through music that weighs, and ultimately defies, society’s stacked odds.", "genre": ["Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/divide-and-dissolve-systemic-review"}

The Australian band, who formed in 1979, encompassed the steadfast purity of early post-punk that emphasized zero frills and even fewer complications. However, much like the provocative tongue-in-cheek hijinks by   and fellow Aussies  , pel mel were complex in their layered nuances of snide hooks and smart song structures, originally carving out their aesthetic as a bar band in Newcastle. There, they performed original songs alongside covers of Wire,  , and Joy Division—all before relocating to the burgeoning underground music scene in Sydney. By the early ’80s, with two LPs and a slew of successful singles under their belt (they were the only Australian band signed by s licensee, GAP Records), pel mel had forged a distinctive identity around contrast, more specifically the interplay between Judy McGee’s airy vocal melodies and the quirky, gnarled guitar lines surrounding them. Technically, McGee isn’t the band’s only singer (guitarist Graeme Dunne occasionally provides backup), but she’s got a singular voice nevertheless—and, given the heavily skewed gender divide that defined post-punk at that time, a historic one as well.  , which collects pel mel’s final recorded tracks, solidifies that legacy from the opposite end of the timeline: the last hurrah from a group who elbowed their way to a major label record deal without compromising once. The   hints towards what pel mel would have sounded like had they not disbanded in 1985—a heavily synthesized sound in contrast to the band’s previous discography that boasted saxophone solos as much as electronic instruments. “Love on a Funeral Pyre” scales down the band to an iteration that includes an FM synth, guitar, bass, and a LinnDrum drum machine. The lo-fi groove of “Shipwrecked” thrives on its inherent sunshine-y simplicity, while “Fool’s House” toes the line of pop music with jangly guitars as McGee, in a melancholic gusto, sings: “I just can’t seem to change my tune / Though it hurts to play the fool.” As the most danceable, disco-laden track, “Mr. President” is influenced by the gritty New York City CBGB crew, namely the Talking Heads, with a funky bassline and deconstructed dance hooks that are punctuated by cymbal crashes. Through the hum of the recording quality and the synthesizer’s fragile melodies, each song teems in in an exposed vulnerability, especially found in the effortlessly enchanting trot of the title track and the breeziness of “Calamity Jane” that harkens to the warm beaches of their hometown. But, simultaneously, there’s wear and tear over these moments. It’s clear these recordings are vestiges of a band who’ve always done things on their own terms.   is far from pel mel’s early pub gigs—it represents a band, with their hewn and planished edges, whose time might’ve ended too soon.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/pel-mel-late-late-show-review"}

And although she began the creative process for   in Karachi, Pakistan, her second album is as rooted in this world as she is. In other words, much of it draws from a rarefied and long-gone era of British music: that of Manchester before Madchester and everywhere before Britpop. That of phone-free warehouse raves that have since become the stuff of legend. That of Glastonbury when weekend tickets cost a whopping 50 pounds. It mines the moments just before the British underground got hip again and turned into an international export worth gazillions—when the words “Gallagher brothers” still meant nothing to anyone, perhaps. It’s all here: old-school acid house; ‘90s trance; the cool detachment of Depeche Mode and Pet Shop Boys; a bit of going-nowhere-fast shoegaze. Lyrically, like the rave greats before her, she knows how to rely on the feel and rhythm of a phrase (especially repeated enough times to resemble a chorus) rather than try to convey too much meaning through it. This is done nowhere better perhaps than on “This World Couldn’t See Us” with the line, “You can have it all in return for everything.” Later, on the irresistible “Gentle Heart,” she invokes the time-honored motif of the girl going out and letting the music set her free: “She rides through the night/ So soft and so free/ This huge moving city is all hers to keep.” We dare you not to feel it. Iqbal is particularly adept at letting everything breathe, be it that groove on “Gentle Heart” or the beguilingly repetitive riff on “Lilac Twilight,” which serves as an intermission. Her songs are loosely constructed, bookended by elongated intros and outros. Opening track “In Light” is pure atmosphere, bordering on ambientronica in places. She never does everything all at once, instead tucking a sitar flourish or tiny harmonic departure behind a steady riff. She weaves quick drum machine taps between a pulsing bassline, reigning it in at just the right moment so the synths soar unimpeded.   has a peculiar loping quality to it, almost that of running in slow motion—a sensation, it’s worth noting, that is nothing if not the stuff of dreams.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/nabihah-iqbal-dreamer"}

The latest album from   a group of New York City-based artists making “east asian cyber-metal” [sic] strives in a similar direction, mixing traditional-sounding pentatonic melodies with a potpourri of genres both brutal and futuristic, from industrial EBM to retrofuturistic synthwave. Though it stumbles at moments,   reimagines what Asian music might sound like. A distant suona heralds the beginning of “Vanity 虛妄.” After the short introduction, gravelly guitars and syncopated toms take things in a more conventionally metal direction, albeit with a synthesized twist. Then—two minutes in, the intensity dissolves, giving way to a post-rock interlude that features an   solo supported by a wistful guitar line. A minute later, and there’s a synthwave drop, heavily compressed and undulating with each kick, after which they conclude the track with a heavy breakdown. Packing a ranging mix of sounds into just under five minutes, the track is a glorious mess that encapsulates the band’s willingness to take risks. Some of these choices pay off, while others don’t land quite as well. “Yè 業” starts off strong, with a pentatonic riff over a measured blitz of guitar and electronics, but their first lyrics break any spell the introduction might have cast with a bit of Weezer-esque cheese: “A Japanese CPU dreams of electric sheep while the system sleeps.” “Wu Wuo 無我” exhibits a similar tension between their progressive sound and sometimes weary subject matter. Beginning with a minimalistic 4×4 beat—we’re deep in techno territory now—they slowly introduce droning   and distorted bass. Then comes George Orwell, with lines from 1984 narrated by a vaguely British voice: “We will abolish the orgasm. There will be no loyalty except loyalty to the Party.” The title of the track translates to “anatta,” the Buddhist concept of non-self; it sounds like a bit of an on-the-nose critique of communism in the Pacific. It’s in these moments when the band dips a little too far into “Asian-influenced fantasy,” the typical sonic signifiers of East Asia used as window dressing for well-worn themes of Asian authoritarianism—yet P.H.0 nevertheless explore musical combinations with a full-throated earnestness that bears fruit in bursts of creativity.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ph0-karma-review"}

The duo, composed of filmmaker and icon of the New York underground Jim Jarmusch and film producer and musician Carter Logan, formed to provide the score for Jarmusch’s opaque spy thriller  (2009). Glacially paced, elliptically structured, and full of mysterious, tight-lipped characters, the film is uniquely enigmatic. Fittingly, it also marked the debut recordings of Sqürl (then known as Bad Rabbit), who lend gnarled guitar drones, otherworldly kosmische, and hazy screwed-up feedback to a soundtrack that also includes fellow travelers through rock music’s outer limits like  ,  , and  . Across a handful of   as well as scores for other Jarmusch films—including the skeletal, unsettling drones in 2013’s   and the hauntological synth music for  —Sqürl have since established themselves as masters of unsettled moods, bringing dreary depth and thorny texture to whatever sounds they explore on a given project. Their debut album,  , feels like a culmination of the meditative, monolithic music they’ve recorded to date. Swirling together frigid memories of no wave, heavy-lidded desert rock, and grayscale ambiance, the record feels crushingly heavy but deceptively elusive; a feedback-laden dream of a dying world. There’s a creeping sense of encroaching apocalypse that’s present from the very start of the record. Lead single “Berlin ‘87,” though explicitly inspired by Jarmusch’s memories of living in the German cultural hub, is a bleak tangle of foreboding guitar lines—paced so that each sludgy melody arrives a little slower than you might expect. It feels damp and mud-streaked, the sort of grim instrumental that’s built to suck you into its gloom. On “The End of the World,” Jarmusch makes the project’s ominousness explicit, gravely intoning a story about teenagers tearing through the end times as more distorted drones waver and roil like the last wisps of smoke rising from a stomped-out fire. Whether his spoken-word explorations are oracular sermonizing or merely speculative fiction, it’s a compelling way to set the tone for the rest of the record that unfolds, an omen of impending doom. Collaboration has always been at the core of Sqürl, both in the alchemistic interplay of Logan and Jarmusch’s experiments, as well as with outside players including lutist Jozef Van Wissem (who contributed heavily to the  score) as well as occasional guest vocalists like Cults’s Madeline Follin. It’s always seemed to lend their downcast, slow-moving music a sense of direction and purpose—a somewhat hopeful idea that if they’re going to trod through these desolate expanses, they will do so with company and camaraderie.  doubles down on this side of their work, welcoming guests on half of its tracks, including appearances from the British singer-songwriter Anika, experimental guitarist Marc Ribot, and French pop mutator and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. At their best, these tracks offer moments of light and peace amid the somber proceedings. Gainsbourg’s contribution especially—to the overcast “John Ashbery Takes A Walk”—feel piercing and powerful, the sort of performance that overtakes the atmosphere and transforms it into something new. There’s heaviness still, for sure, but her whispered, abstract poetry lends their sound new depth, turning the uneasy instrumental into something more complicated, more beautiful. Moments like these showcase the strange power of Sqürl. Exploratory and never didactic, they follow all of their boldest impulses. And while they seem most comfortable in the darkness, they don’t restrain themselves to one style or sound.

Could an album concentrate, redefine, and update the genre of bedroom pop if it wasn’t literally made in a bedroom?   the excellent debut from Swedish duo  , comprised of twins Inez and Ella Johansson, suggests it might. As noted in the album’s liner notes, “the origins of 7ebra [started] with Inez whiling away the hours playing guitar in her bedroom,” anticipating   particular feel, its grain. The arrangements are sparse (each instrument seems siloed in its own wool-lined space), with production as warm and desiccated as a dusty sunlit sill. Supposedly lacking a studio’s arsenal of sonic material, bedroom pop is typically made with limited resources—and though 7ebra did record in a studio (an important thing to note), they also reconfigure familiar sounds throughout: no-nonsense, slightly plastic-y organs; the clean-to-dirty-to-clean guitar tones; those dehydrated drums that  ,  , and   around an uncanny valley between real and fake. This minimalist approach is not imposed, but instead suggests a kind of deliberate, aesthetic hyper-restriction. There’s nothing slapdash about  , though. The languid, lullaby-ish melodies on “Rude Boy,” “Done With The Day,” and “Secretly Bad” are deceptively simple; only a faultless convergence of feeling and precision achieves that super-subtle trace of grit in the delivery of the line “tell me a story where you pretend.” Rich, deftly-layered harmonies on “Lighter Better” and “Lean” overlap in such a way that they could be composed of five voices, as opposed to two. Often panned left and right, the harmonies’ spacing suggests the sisters taking respective spaces around the same microphone, perhaps huddled together in a shared bedroom, a sock for a pop filter. Sisterhood seems woven into the lyrics too. Sly, shy, and diaristic, they’re filled with reflective phrases like “how the hell am I supposed to feel?” that seem directed inwards, or at a listener already familiar with the context. Some lines have the stop-start prosody of a story relayed to a confidant, the adoption of different registers to flesh out the roles; a key dichotomy seems to be between what was said and what could have been said. The scattergun topics and heavy repetition of thoughts (“Wakey Wakey” and “Born To Care” both contain one line repeated ad infinitum) suggest either internal monologue or unloading onto someone close. “Secretly Bad,” “Stripey Horsey,” and “I Have A Lot To Say” are characterized by sentiments and admissions often only possible in private. The close, airless quality of the vocals (notched with the faintest telephone EQ) suggests voice notes recorded just after a messy emotional climax.

Elements of techno, house, R&B, futuristic soul, and West African percussion are filtered through a Southern hip-hop lens to create bright, emotive music. His debut album, ,   as a world builder—“historical fiction” about his own life told through dreamlike synth loops and improvisational lyricism. The singer’s new album,  , follows the same path of experimentation, but veers further into pop territory for a dreamy and danceable joyride. Murray opens the album with “Come In,” a sparse track with a chiptune-like loop underscoring his baritone chant. It’s enthralling and inviting; a siren song leading you into the water. He comes back to this meditative space frequently throughout the album, but the backbone of Murray’s music is experimentation—on  , the only constant is change. You can hear the sounds of the mid-2010s New York City electronic underground scene on “Empty,” a soulful track with electro-pop synths and slowed-down house beats. “Give Me a Reason,” a song about an all encompassing love that comes to an end, is a rapid Detroit techno–style track aimed squarely at the dancefloor. The mood and tempo of each track makes the record sound like the passing of seasons, with Murray taking us through the cities and scenes that have influenced him as an artist. “Köln,” sung in German, features a soaring synth loop and Murray’s soft croon—it easily suggests a spring afternoon in one of the sprawling gardens and parks of Berlin or Cologne. “Sora Ni Mau Maboroshi,” a cover of an obscure 1980s song by Japanese new wave band  , is a strange but soothing album closer. Murray recreates the Japanese new wave song into a crisp bass track with a hypnotizing looped piano. That the singer-songwriter is part of a long lineage of musicians is palpable—he channels and honors his ancestors throughout the record with expert musicianship and unfettered emotion.  is a tour de force, an album that rides the waves and shows that there is freedom in constant movement.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/sequoyah-murray-ilgrain-review"}

Most orb-weavers you’re likely to see in the wild are female; many males never spin a web their entire lives. In her twelve-month lifespan, the nocturnal spider spends the majority of her life casting silken webs against the follies of the wind and the wild, destroying her work and beginning anew each night. These large arachnids don’t normally pose a threat to humans, but their webs—  connected by wispy, glistening threads—are dense, large, and imposing, designed to capture any small creature that dares enter its habitat. If you’ve watched a live performance from  , the solo project of New Mexico-based musician Madeline Johnston, you’ll understand what it means to be shrouded in a gauzy haze. Johnston builds her own vocal processors out of old telephone receivers, and at her concert at Brooklyn’s Union Pool last month, the vocal effects were so all-consuming that they began to pick up the sound of cheers and applause from the audience. Soon, the entire crowd became a part of her sound, subsumed by her own dense, large, imposing web of reverb. Across  , Midwife’s new collaborative album with Louisville, Kentucky’s  , source material becomes blurred from its echo, a woven tapestry of layered vocals and guitars that glimmer like its namesake’s hypnotic, dew-studded webs. Johnston and Diaz, who performs as  , originally met online during the isolation of the early pandemic in 2020. Their shared musical influence is obvious. Midwife creates gossamer, self-described “heaven metal” that rests somewhere between the quiet reflections of   and towering post-rock of   while Vyva Melinkolya has worked with musicians like   founder and bedroom pop prodigy   to   inspired equally by   and  . When they finally met at Johnston’s Las Cruces studio in the summer of 2021, they spent their nights prowling the desert, looking for snakes, lizards, and spiders.  , the product of those sessions, sounds like a sweltering, delirious search for meaning in the middle of the night. Midwife’s 2020 album   underscored unnerving lyrics about internalized violence and irreparable self-harm with reflective, plaintive piano melodies. In her past work as Vyva Melinkolya, Diaz layered guitar tones—a dense, base layer of reverb beneath a lighter melodic lead guitar—that acted as a kind of Greek chorus to her nostalgic opines. On  , they combine their approaches: an arpeggiated guitar is the base palette, a soft heartbeat beneath the Hole-inspired opener “Miss America” and a meditative march driving forward the breathless hope of “NMP.” “No more pain,” they sing in unison, eerily determined and yet anesthetized, like true believers in a religious cult. The search for a higher power is a recurring theme on the album—on “Hounds of Heaven,” they reference English writer Francis Thompson’s   about God’s tireless pursuit of the human soul. And yet, even in submitting to the hope of transcendence, they still search for a personal connection: “If it’s all just the same to you/ Would you take my hand?” Throughout the album, they’re humbled not just by the great beyond, but by their own natural surroundings. On “Plague X,” an unsettling narrative about a life spent hiding underground soon reveals itself to be a description of New Mexican summer: “Whitest sand/ Blackest sky/ Brittle bodies/ Yellow eyes,” Johnston chants. When she sings about a “web of lies,” it recalls the album’s titular invertebrate, weaving its silk under the cover of darkness, praying to make it until the next nightfall. On  , Johnston and Diaz spin their own silken networks of guitar delay and reverb, thick with the paralyzing heat of a Southwestern summer.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/midwife-vyva-melinkolya-orbweaving-review"}

Réunion has no indigenous culture of its own—it was uninhabited until French settlement in the 17th century. Its population’s heritage—via slavery and trade routes—came from Africa, India, Europe, Madagascar, China, and elsewhere, and its culture is a constantly evolving fusion of all of those and more. PANGAR emphasize that quality heavily on their latest,  , with voiceovers proclaiming the power of hybridity and “open thoughts, creole thoughts” on “(cHAo$ MonDe).” Their beats are built for a world in flux, with dancehall, Afro-Latin soundsystems, techno, industrial, even heavy metal all in the mix. As the mention of “metal” might suggest, this is not all hip-grinding party music. But it’s not   that, either. Though there’s a lot of distortion and plenty of threatening atmospheres, the mixdowns are super tight, and the finely crafted dynamics and punchy riffs give it the same thrill-ride sensation as heavyweight ‘90s techno and breakbeat—even when the tempo is down at a low and slow dancehall lope. Like a lot of the output from the Uganda label  , PANGAR expertly tread the tightrope between aggro experimentalism and the pleasure principle. Perhaps appropriately for a tropical island known as much for its unspoiled jungle and long clean beaches as its colonial rule and military outposts, this often feels like music for a rave on the edge of the world. Its function will change with context: It’s possible to imagine, say, the acid dancehall of “lucy#97424” working equally well when mixed into   and bashment with sirens and MCs upping the party energy, as it would in and amongst  -style industrial dub bleakness for darker, moodier clubs.

In songs built from a series of mantra-like vocal loops, the artist Ayo Leilani appropriates the notion of psychic warfare to explore her experiences with seizures. On the opening track, “Lucid,” the sound of cresting waves calmly lulls listeners as Leilani’s voice offers assurance that it’s all just a dream, her layered vocals flowing and ebbing like the tide. Like 2018’s  and 2020’s  the songs on   are pulled from a lush palette of jazz and trip-hop—audible in the shimmering “Dreaming,” featuring  , and the bare-bones boom bap drums on “Bird’s Eye View (O.B.E.)” and “Save Me.” Leilani’s delivery often has a stripped-down minimalism, which pairs well with the muted trumpets and smooth guitar on “Dizzy” and “Aura.” In other moments, the arrangements skew even sparser, embracing a deliberate simplicity. On the torch-bearing “I’m Sad,” Leilani turns the lights down until all that’s left are her own vocal loops and piano, with a string ensemble slowly joining in soulful mourning. Soul and jazz might inform Witch Prophet’s music, but  also toys with contemporary hip-hop production more than her previous work. On the  -assisted “Memory,” jazz arrangements are supplemented by a chorus of pitch-bent,trap hi-hats. The wonky drill beat of “Fire” is paired with a classical guitar that wouldn’t sound out of place on a YoungBoy Never Broke Again or   single. The Fugees–like “Energy Vampire” supplements a groovy bassline with an Auto-Tuned rap verse from  . On the closing track, “God Universe Magic (G.U.M.),” Leilani describes her lyrics as “speaking spells.” More than any one sound or style,  is a showcase for the richness of Leilani’s voice.

Gamedze explains his view of history in dynamic terms: “not being unfinished,” “unfolding,” and “something that people can actually create.” The idea that history is not the result of a metaphysical predetermining force centers humanity, proposing to us that it is human social activity as the engine that drives the whole enterprise. Created as a companion piece to Gamedze’s   also called  , the film not only documents the work that Gamedze does to articulate the musical aspect of his ideas—it also shows him and comrades   and   wrestling with the social and political implications of these ideas. What is history and who gets to make it? How do the events of the past shape our present and future? These are the primary themes that inform the album. The opener “Turbulence’s Pulse” sets the tone with a rich, searching piano and a monotone chant reminding us that “turbulent times call for extreme measures…” Gamedze’s drum pattern here is a loose, swinging anchor holding the music together as the speaker reflects on how both musical time and historical time are created by humans working together. “Wynter Time” is a nine-minute epic of exploratory improvisation. After the ensemble opens, playing freely, the tune’s elegant, regal melody gives way to an inventive tenor sax solo by Buddy Wells. “Locomotion” is a driving drum and percussion-heavy tune that showcases the band’s ability to marry bebop’s melodic conventions with open-eared free playing. Robin Fassie and Wells’s solos on trumpet and tenor sax respectively are fierce and bassist Thembinkosi Mavimbela shines with a big, heavy tone and intricate lines. Contrasting the more fiery pieces with softer, more contemplative moments, Gamedze’s ensemble is capable of playing with great sensitivity and attention to detail on tunes like “Melancholia” and “Out Stepped Zim.” By now, jazz improvisation as a musical metaphor for liberal ideas about democracy is a well-worn and widespread cliché. Despite this, there is something important to be gleaned from how this music has taught us to work together to change our circumstances. Jazz and history have two essential things in common: They don’t exist without human initiative and collaboration. We are the driving force behind it all and by acknowledging and understanding that, we can write a new story as the future unfolds before us.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/asher-gamedze-turbulence-and-pulse-review"}

Her latest album comes with a name change—a playful shortening to  —and a shift in sound to follow suit, pushing her music’s capacity for releasing stress into bolder territory. On  , French works in bigger and more confident forms of electronic pop than before without sacrificing her easygoing outlook. With influences ranging from Kylie Minogue to SOPHIE, French’s style is freewheeling, fluidly blitzing through languid dream pop (“california”) and pitched-up house (“beep beep”). On “black ferrari,” French’s pulsing, four-on-the-floor beat races and her newfound exhilaration is effervescent as she sings, “I never felt like this before.” Club-ready big beat highlight “gemmy juice” best exemplifies the expansiveness of French’s new approach, suddenly flipping to the low-end for a Sarah Bonito hook indebted to the iconic drops of Basement Jaxx. What unites everything on   is its persistent vibe of blissed-out haze acting as a protective shroud against the pressures of the outside world. Each piece of the album title gets a track of its own, embodying different forms of escape via hyperpop house (“cbd”), ethereal jungle instrumentals (“reiki”), or interdimensional shoegaze/vaporwave transmissions (“moonbeam”). The occasional 180s between inspirations and modes only adds to how loose and free the record feels, with a palpable enthusiasm that never allows the endorphin high to dip for too long. If there’s any track that best embodies what Lindsey French accomplishes with a new sonic palette at her disposal, it’s “daydream.” Though never veering from the song’s laid-back pop vibe, French subtly adds small flourishes to keep things bubbly—a synth string solo in one moment, a triumphant trumpet loop the next. Even at a whisper, French’s delicate pitch-shifted vocals soar and her words carry the high of love: “Chemicals burning inside/ Constellations shining in your eyes.” Whether by taking a deep breath or spending a night on the dancefloor,   represents a re-centering of the self.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/neggy-gemmy-cbd-reiki-moonbeam-review"}

Segal’s ragga-tinged drums sound massive, providing a solid concrete foundation for Woods to build upon. There are jazz flourishes, like the looping piano line on “The Layover” or the eerie horns of “Hangman,” and the Blue Note-riffing “Blue Smoke” brings a smoky jazz lounge to life, all pitter-patter cymbals and chaotic double bass.

For the last few years Daisies have been tirelessly prolific—this is their seventh studio release since 2019—and they show no sign of slowing down.

None of the individual Daisies’ creative efforts feel jarring or distracting but rather add to the album’s mesmerizing atmosphere. “Blue Cowboy” bounces along with a dizzying dance beat while the vocals croon and drift in the front of the mix, sweetly sounding like a lost track from a Gus Van Sant movie. “Goin’ In Circles” is upbeat and dense with more space to let the gold sounds ring out. The song itself cruises along effortlessly while the lyrics allude to a more tumultuous journey. “Is It Any Wonder” has a coffee shop–rock, ‘90s radio hit vibe, but, you know, not corny. The chorus instantly feels familiar, like something you’ve heard a thousand times before—so much so that you might check twice just to make sure it isn’t some cover lingering in the back of your brain.

In the ensuing years, she’s gradually closed that gap, incorporating more piano sketches (the exquisite performances of which were honed by her years of training and competition) as well as her voice, fragile and whispered. Finding near perfection in every element of her oeuvre to date—electronic and natural modulations of voice; layers of synth and field recordings; trembling piano impressions that leave no follicle unflexed— feels like a gut punch and tender caress at the same time. “I can be everything,” says Liyou alongside a detuned piano. “A son/ A daughter/ Spring.” A moment during the denouement of “April in Paris (봄),” before a sampled interview and orchestral swell close out the track, this revelation is bittersweet. A “dog dream” (개꿈), after all, is a flight of fancy, one that Liyou needs to be reminded of. The three tracks that comprise the 38 minutes of (개꿈) might be closer to movements in a symphony, each centered around a different entity whom Liyou addresses—in “April in Paris (봄),” it’s the titular April (“A month, a season” and a “woman”), who might speak into existence all the facets of Liyou’s gender identity. In the title track, the addressee is a lover who might “지켜봐” (watch over) Liyou. These whispered words close out a devastating 14 minutes of bilingual, poetic longing; electronic shimmer and drone; and aching piano improvisations. At about 11 minutes and 20 seconds, the musical elements converge into a moment of pure catharsis as the bass and piano lines resolve and dissipate. In the aftermath, Liyou sings in a voice quivering yet clear: “Why can’t I depend on me?/ Why can’t I bend for me?/ Why can’t you depend on me?/ When I need someone to need me?” She yearns for another from whom they might receive—and give back—words of love, the simple reciprocity that drives human existence yet eludes their best efforts. The final movement “Fold The Horse (종이접기)” refers to the art of origami (  in Korean), the subjectivities of paper horse and narrator folding together by the end of the track.

When the genre first emerged in the early ’10s, it confounded in its utter contradiction of what made so much of the music industry function up to that point. Vaporwave’s reckless use of samples, sea of anonymous artists, free-of-charge ethos, and embrace of sounds and styles often looked down upon by common tentpoles of taste set it apart so much that many critics at the time rejected it completely. But nonetheless, vaporwave kept chugging on, to the point where now its irreverent, internet-damaged fingerprints are noticeable in the culture everywhere. Few have dedicated themselves so dutifully to the genre as  , who are celebrating their 10-year anniversary with this collection of some of the net label’s juiciest shopping-mall-funk cuts. Labelhead John Zobele (aka  ) has always maintained an ambitious release schedule: the label drops a new album every single Friday at noon without fail, a philosophy that’s resulted in an absolutely massive catalog of releases over the years. At three hours long,   spins like an endless DJ mix, sucking you into a whirlpool of fudged up ‘80s rhythms, soul samples distorted beyond recognition, and CD-skipping bliss. The compilation leads us down a heavenly hallway of vaporwave’s greatest hits, cruising through various phases:  ’s funky “intercast インターキャスト” shimmies and bustles with its booming snare hits, while   cranks the distortion into oblivion on the crunched up VHS jam “IBM Lotus Night.”  ’s “Chatroom” grooves on a syrupy waiting room slide, rocking the listener into a lull before  ’s own “ホーリーゴースト (holy ghost)” plumbs the uncanny valley with its video game-y chimes and hard-panned, hold music–handclaps.

For their next act, Rose fashioned themselves a fame-crazed automaton with empty eyes and plastic skin on an absurdist   journey to total failure on 2020’s ill-fated conceptual pop record  . (Ill-fated because, you know, 2020; the record itself was quite good.) Yet   shone brightest when Rose went from superficial to super-real, dropping themselves into the terrifying moment when the main-character-of-their-own-life becomes cognizant of how much has been lost in the quest to follow their heart—and how desperately they wish to hit reset on it all. Alas! No do overs in this world. What now? The “now” is what Rose grapples with on  , an unflinching chronicle of a dark night of the soul with all the swelling violas and Spanish guitars and flickering harps such high drama deserves, crammed through a purview so small and personal it could fit neatly inside a jewelry box. The record has something of a storyline the way life sometimes has a storyline—a terrible break up, a season passed in the swamp of self-doubt—but Rose is not playing a character, for once. This is them, these are their feelings and this is what they are: rejection, regret, desperation, and sadness. Far from being a drag,   is revelatory. As a songwriter, Rose has never been better; as an arranger, doubly so. In contrast to   slick synthetic textures,   splits the difference between experimental, modular sounds and manipulated analog flourishes that convey the unreliable qualities of memory, alternately mutating, degrading, or coming into heartbreakingly sharp focus, looping back and forth on itself in an endless cycle in search of an exit. The result is a record that feels constructed to mimic the uncomfortable feelings of rumination that accompany periods of deep personal growth. Rose is fearless in their expression. On “Miami,” they wrestle with the pain of rejection over frantic instrumentation that escalates like a panic attack until Rose is nearly wailing the chorus. “This is the hard part/ The part that they don’t tell you about,” they sing, their voice growing hoarser with each word. “There is the art of loving/ This is the art of forgetting how.” On the shimmery, slinky “The Kiss,” Rose attempts to soothe their shattered heart with the kiss from someone new and plasticine ’80s pop—“I would do most anything,” they whimper, their tone as downcast as it is desperate. Throughout   Rose mines their own memories for bits of comfort both cold and common sense—their mother tells them to stop victimizing themself; there’s a song about their therapist (“Jill Says”). In an inspired artistic choice, interspersed between the songs are clips of voicemails left for Rose by their grandmother, Mee Maw, who showers them with message after message of unconditional adoration: I miss you, I love you, I am always thinking about you—a potent reminder that there are kinds of love that remain constant even if the mind itself deteriorates. Do things improve for our intrepid Rose? Sort of. Not really. No. Well? Maybe. By the time Rose arrives at the closing track “Where Do I Go From Here?” they’re still at war with their conscience over the inability to let go of things they cannot change. “Take all this pain and learn to love yourself again,” sings the angel of Rose’s better nature. “Shut up,” is the reply to this pointless platitude. Some things are too painful to ever be forgotten, but they   be transmuted. “The memories live on in this song,” concludes Rose.

But push past the song’s breezy vocal melody, and you encounter lyrics tackling the pervasiveness of disinformation not only in the world of   but in our own as well, as Olsen asks, “How are we supposed to see beyond the propaganda?” Yet even in the midst of global collapse, Olsen is able to locate bright seeds of hope. “Always On My Mind” and “Fireflies” are a pair of sweet songs about love and deep intimacy. Lush electric piano and subtle drum machine are the perfect backdrop for Olsen’s swooning, lovesick lyrics on “Fireflies”: “You took me by surprise/ Like fireflies/ Got lost in your eyes/ Symphonies while we sigh/ And hotel fries/ Bicycles through the night/ Kiss by moonlight.” And for however lyrically dark  gets, the sonic environment Olsen has constructed is one of undeniable richness and beauty.

As you move through the ritualistic crescendos of “Seed,” the barking warriors of “Howl,” and the discordant lilt of “Fawn,” it feels like a beautifully realized world of forbidding darkness—very occult, very countercultural. But then, as things go on, the album becomes less about the dark drama of the setting, and you start to notice that   sticking with you. The melodies and phrasing on the songs is quite addictive, and there’s a bounce to the beats, not just militant crashing. While it might well disturb and transgress, this music is pop, too. And that’s when a really odd comparison works its way to the surface: this is kind of like Beyoncé’s  . Not that this   like   Gately’s European folk (and folk horror) sensibility and sonic abrasiveness constantly bring you back to those more experimental influences. But there’s something about the ambition, the confrontation, the refusal of any false duality between pop and avant-garde, and particularly that sense of decades and even centuries of culture bubbling up through the cracks, that feels regally assured in a similar way. The haunted house camp of “Scale” and the cyberpunk techno of “Chaw” are way out on their own, and that anti-pop countercultural weirdness can clash with the hookiness at times. But as ancient New Orleans jazz dances into the finale of “Tame” and “Melt,” it’s hard to think of anyone else mining history over heavyweight beats in such a way.

As part of collective  , she has taken an active role in uplifting people from marginalized identities and creating community. On her first full-length album,   she turns towards the personal and internal, but this interconnectedness with others is reflected in friends’ and family’s contributions to the album, be it her mother’s reaction to the music prompting the title or her friend   writing a poem to accompany the release. While not explicitly naming a specific reason, Maristuen refers in the album notes to a stressful period in her life when she was faced with having to change both her priorities and her routine. At the time, reframing her relationship with music became not just a necessity but a personal challenge. By making music every day and taking long walks in Berlin’s large parks, Maristuen began to reconnect with herself. The album has an unexpectedly soothing quality, an oxymoronic mix of melancholy and hope distilled through a series of elegant yet playful modern electronic compositions. It’s lightweight, almost luminous, particularly on tracks like the joyous “Tomorrow is Beautiful!

The Turkish rock band’s career has centered around livewire versions of traditional songs from their home country, and they’re deeply attuned to how art steeped in history can move towards a bold future. “Badi Sabah Olmadan,” the opener to their fifth album  , telegraphs as much: searing guitar melodies wind around crashing cymbals and a driving bassline, as if they’re going on a long, treacherous journey into the unknown. They released a version of the track on their 2021 benefit album  , but they’ve swapped out the electronic beat for a real drum kit here. In this way,   is a return to form for Altin Gün, straying from the 80s synthpop and electronic sheen that defined the band’s past couple LPs and committing to bracing psych rock. Paramount to Altın Gün’s success is how every instrument is in perfect lockstep. On “Çıt Çıt Çedene,” an agile bassline dances around flitting synth melodies and strummed guitars before Erdinç Ecevit arrives to offer contemplative, wistful vocals. Soft, shaken percussion mirrors the way he sings the titular line; it’s simple, charming, and playful. On other songs, the band lets their instruments flesh out lyrical themes. “Rakıya Su Katamam,” for example, is a sweaty and celebratory track, replete with Merve Daşdemir’s triumphantly singing about falling in love and dancing.

While she pushes and pulls her vocals into surprising shapes, her music still feels personal, using these guttural melodies as a vehicle for diving into the darkest areas of the mind and heart. Mitchell   by listening to her surroundings and improvising melodies off of them. If she heard crickets chirping nearby, for example, she’d record herself humming along, and later on, she altered them in Ableton.

The sound of early music serves as a guiding light: The album’s opener “Penance” begins with a simple, forlorn hum that expands into a haunted web that sounds like a medieval hymn, while “Ache of Surrender” sounds like an electrified Gregorian chant. Throughout  , Mitchell sings vowels instead of lyrics, evoking feelings from the textures and timbres of her voice rather than stating them plainly. Those emotions feel their most concrete on the album’s peak, “Reconciliation.” At the start of the track, Mitchell’s voice emerges as a poignant polyphony and gradually morphs into a groove of blown-out basses and otherworldly hums. It creates a feeling of catharsis, a moment of ecstatic release after all the turbulence, and shows how her electronic manipulations produce results that feel natural.

This rich and spontaneous act of communication is the beating heart that animates  , the newest album from tenor saxophonist, James Brandon Lewis and his trio consisting of Chris Hoffman on cello and drummer Max Jaffe. The album opens with “Foreground,” a brief, head-bopping intro that pulls listeners into its swinging groove before dissipating. It’s the first curveball in an album full of unexpected occurrences. With “Someday We’ll All Be Free,” the trio take on Donny Hathaway’s uplifting 1973 R&B classic. With lyrics written by his friend, Edward Ulysses Howard, the song’s heartfelt message of perseverance was intended to be a comfort for Hathaway who was struggling with his declining mental health. In the hands of Lewis and the trio, “Someday We’ll All Be Free” is transformed into a slow-moving march whose emotional tone hangs somewhere between mournful and reluctant optimism. Jaffe’s drumming here is particularly expressive, providing both rhythmic propulsion and sonic color, while Lewis wrings every bit of ache and joy out of Hathaway’s melody From here the band slides into “The Blues Still Blossoms,” a slow, tune brimming with emotional depth. As the piece opens, Lewis states the main melody, before Hoffman echoes the statement and the two respond and play off one another with patience and grace. “Middle Ground” and the album’s title track “Eye Of I” push the energy up to dramatic extremes. On both tracks, Hoffman’s distorted cello cuts through the flurry of sound conjured by Jaffe and Lewis as the band reaches punk-like heights of volume and intensity. On “Eye Of I,” the trio’s ability to listen, improvise and respond even in the midst of such a hellacious flurry is impressive. The music here sounds brutal and abstract, but not arbitrary. Throughout its 44-minute run time,   makes a case that the communicative nature that has defined jazz remains strong among our best young players.

In an effort to stamp out the rich cultural reservoirs from which African people drew strength and identity, African music and traditional religion were effectively banned on plantations throughout the United States. Africans were allowed to attend church, smuggling the expressive power of their religion and music into the church behind the facade of Christianity. Thus, the Black church became the sole refuge where enslaved Africans could cut loose from the daily cycle of surveillance and punishment that stifled every other aspect of their lives. This cruel dynamic created a divide between the sacred and the spiritual where none had existed before. With its thematic dance between good and evil and its stylistic mixture of gospel with the blues, country, and rock n’ roll,   embodies all of this history. The album’s opener, “Love’s Death Bed,” tackles love and loss as Ward speaks directly to a lover who she promises will be her “last heartbreak.” We listen in as their relationship dissolves as the beautiful chorus “On love’s death bed, I lay my bouquet of flowers / On love’s death bed, I cry away our final hours.” drives the final nail into the coffin. “No Reason” is a treatise on human duality wrapped up in an upbeat country-rock tune. Over a popping groove and swooning background vocals, Ward describes a person who struggles to reconcile the best and worst aspects of their character. It’s a brilliantly executed song. “I Got No Fight” is a fantastic example of weariness as an emotional and thematic device commonly used in both the blues and gospel music. When Ward sings “Been up all night waiting for day to come. I want it over long before it’s done”, she embodies the feeling of weariness in the blues: A deep, unshakable emotional fatigue that comes from being Black in an anti-black world. Beautifully played and full of Ward’s moving vocal performances (check her gorgeous cover of Dionne Farris’ “Hopeless”),  is a stellar work of art. By reconciling the emotional, political, and spiritual dichotomies that have characterized so much Black music, Ward shows us that wholeness is possible.", "genre": ["Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/sunny-war-anarchist-gospel-review"}

By opening the album with an invitation, Siifu and Ahwlee signpost the fact that they’re taking listeners on a warm, comforting musical journey down the imaginary world of Leather Boulevard. “Cnt Go Back (Tell Me)” features contributions from  ,  ,  , and  , and its crunchy live drums and upright bassline conjure the spirit of the smoky jazz lounges that, in the early to mid-‘90s, were incubators for the sound that would later be labeled “neo-soul.” “Diamonds” is low-key and wistful, built around a strong performance from Siifu as he raps about persevering through hard times and showing up for his family and friends. “Neems (Naima),” featuring   and Akeema Zane, reinterprets the classic composition   composed for his first wife, Juanita “Naima” Austin. The song’s ebullient melody and breezy chords call to mind Stevie Wonder’s 1979 electronic masterpiece,  . Toward the track’s conclusion, they up the emotional ante by adding a recording of a man tearfully pleading to his partner to give their love another chance. “Soundgood” is a sweet, summery trip through the neighborhood; Siifu observes his surroundings with affection, greeting the folks around him backed by a lovely, guitar-led instrumental. The album’s midpoint is marked by the slick and hilarious devotional “Wassup” with a vocal mix that’s vigorous and lively, capturing Sifu’s tender whisper, while Devin Morrison’s harmonies and leads are rich and dynamic. The song ends with a skit inviting folks to come to a variety of themed club nights, including “Come Chill and Kick It Night,” “Ratchet Night,” and “Queer Night, where everybody can come through and be themselves.” The world of   may be imaginary, but as the album goes on, it becomes clear that the street that gives the album its title could be in Stankonia, or it could be on P-Funk’s Mothership, or in Henry Dumas’s Holly Springs—or any other place where Black folks can imagine a world in which we are able to create, make love, and be free.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/b-cool-aid-leather-blvd-review"}

Gradually, Katherine Paul’s voice begins to surface: first as a series of wordless murmurs, then as the verse that acts as a statement of purpose for her third full-length album as  . “I know you’re watching me, I know it’s hard to meet you,” she sings. She’s addressing her ancestors, the Coast Salish people native to the Pacific Northwest. Multi-tracked harmonies overlap and blend, slowly building to a stunning crescendo that sounds like  going full post-rock. Overdriven lead guitars bend and swoop through the haze, propelled by echoing tom drums. While Paul’s prior work has always been intense, it has never sounded quite so vast. Soon after the release of 2019’s acclaimed  , Paul moved from Portland back to her homeland, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community in Washington.   recounts the emotional highs and lows of the experience, incorporating the people, landmarks, and language that comprise her home. Paul’s own parents make a guest appearance on the extended coda of “Spaces,” her own voice blending seamlessly into her mother’s as her father’s resounds strongly in the distance. “Sčičudᶻ (a narrow place),” named for a forest path by the Salish Sea, reflects on the intense connection Paul feels to her natural surroundings, communicating directly with the trail itself. “You know there’s not a part of me that’s not there. I feel it every time I walk through you,” she sings during the track’s weightless introduction, propped up solely by dreamy, fingerpicked guitar. Like many other songs on the record, it follows a linear structure, transitioning from a hummed melody to an impressionist verse and, finally, to an instrumental jam that plays out like a cathartic reaction to the rumination that precedes it. Lead guitar riffs trace shimmering routes across a backdrop of feedback and organ, as if to mimic the real-world setting “Sčičudᶻ” invokes. is Black Belt Eagle Scout’s longest, most ambitious effort to date, breaking from the comparatively traditional songcraft of her earlier work to pursue sprawling, meditative tunes that begin and end on their own terms.

Miller on “Someone Else,” a nervous yet disarmingly upbeat song off  ’s latest  . From the song’s  -esque tone to the snarling guitar solo during the bridge, “Someone Else” serves as a microcosm for the rest of the record, a great jangly pop album that finds its footing in the small, melancholic moments that appear between big feelings. As soon as you put the record on, it’s clear that this record springs to life through its lyrics. The album’s opener “Chance Encounter” commemorates a partner’s old haunts (“that restaurant that let us eat for free”) and all the ways to show you still love someone, aware of how those things can be both bittersweet and wonderful. While the history of grown-up guitar pop bands attempting to turn teenage emotions into something transcendent is long and varied, it’s in the little details where Blues Lawyer carve out a confident niche in well-trodden territory. “Return Policy” picks up where “Someone Else” leaves off, drummer/vocalist Elyse Schrock demanding to be taken back to where their partner first found them over steady, fuzzed-out guitar riffs. It’s a sharp, sticky song that recalls the best of ’90s power pop but excels due to its finer qualities, notably how each chord progression in the verse is punctuated with a quick hit of guitar harmonics. There’s also the chorus, awkwardly lurching forward before being smoothed over by Schrock’s harmonies. Blues Lawyer bring personality to a familiar framework by not allowing for much space between every small heartbreak and disappointment. Each pensive moment is given exactly enough time to breathe before the band moves on. The straightforward, genuine nature of songs like “I Won’t” or “Nowhere to Go” is only emphasized by their conciseness. Miller’s wistful vocals make the latter one of   most wrenching songs, while on “Understood,” Ellen Matthews steals the whole tune with a 15-second guitar solo. Much of   chronicles the more bummer aspects of adult life––from uncertainty in relationships (“Second Chance”) to terrible wages (“Salary”) with lived-in conviction––but its the band’s optimism that proves most memorable. “Scenic Route,” with its mechanical floor tom–oriented drum beat and charmingly simple melody, is a weary smile of a song.

There are few better recent examples of this sonic evolution than   the fifth full-length album by Toronto-based Japanese ex-pat producer/multi-instrumentalist   It’s loaded with striking melodic beauty and soft textures applied to visions of nature’s grand design and tiny details of urban existence, delivered primarily in pristine digital strokes. Broadening the scale feels like a natural step forward for Takahashi’s music. A self-proclaimed “bedroom recorder,” he made his first tracks in Tokyo and Vancouver, where he lived briefly a decade ago, his songs already bearing the hallmarks of a sentimental and almost pop composer. His early work, often acoustic guitar–based melodic miniatures, would pull from folk and Japanese environmental music while also showcasing chamber pop–minded arrangements, even diving into brief bursts of digital chaos or found sound. In interviews, Takahashi   lo-fi-meets-hi-fi songwriter-producers like  , Beck, and  /  as musicians he admires. His 2020 move to Toronto and the accompanying context (pandemic, new place, solitude, “the coldest winter I have ever experienced”) seemed to slightly reframe the notion of the sounds that emerged from his bedroom. A completely solo tape for   entitled   is full of gorgeous psychedelic ambience, more DAW-based, bright and glacial, but, strangely, weightier than anything Takahashi has previously released. It was also a hit, especially after Toronto’s excellent   issued it on vinyl (mastered for LP, in a reciprocal nod, by Defever).  expands that increasingly lush, digital, meticulously tender soundscape while bringing back a collaborative aspect that unites Takahashi’s Tokyo past with his Toronto present. It also adds a rhythmic life. The machine beats may be mere wisps, pulses around which the songs are gently wrapped, like warm Balearic winds, Tropicália-meets-chillout, yet they never stop driving the pieces forward. The various reeds—melodica, flute, clarinet, and saxophone—are folded into cascading synths, electric guitar chords, and piano asides in a kind of mini-wall of sound that simultaneously hints at both smooth jazz’s softness and post-rock’s gravitas. (Kudos to Sandro Perri for the mix.)

A little   here, some   there—that sort of thing. Only without any vocals or embarrassing Anglophile-isms.

The bass is my voice and the notes are my lyrics.” If you’re wondering what his bass is trying to say, here’s the main takeaway:  ’s melodic tracks are as loosely tied to travel as many of their titles (“Windy City Dreams,” “London Fog,” “Western Dime”) suggest. Ford’s journey isn’t disjointed either. His songwriting and lean basslines are laser-focused—largely free of the ambient sequences he’s leaned on in the past, and revolving around groove-locked rhythms that refuse to relinquish their power.

Their meticulous sound design practice is an influence from their late partner  , whose handcrafted waveforms and avoidance of sampling left an early impression on Manji. On  , Manji’s debut album, they recycle shards of cullet from various club and rave genres to craft iridescent pop amalgamations that deftly explore the connections between human, machine, and the environment Often inspired by nature—and its anthropogenic destruction—Manji nevertheless eschews field recording, instead synthesizing what sounds like cyborg birdsong to tint their emotional soundscapes with a post-apocalyptic hue. “Oil/Too Much” is a prime example of this tendency, a song inspired by the environmental devastation that accompanies crude oil extraction. Opening with clicks and chirps that flit from ear to ear, the track shifts into a two-step elegy from the perspective of the Earth. “You’re burning my insides/ For a world that’s hurting me too much,” they sing during the chorus, accompanied by vaporous trance synths. “Eyes/Not Enough,” on the other hand, was created in response to the wildfires that devastated Greece in 2021. “I wish the tears could stop the fires/ But there are not enough eyes to cry,” they sing, interrupted by a cacophony of computer-generated noises and gabber-esque kicks put through a slew of filters. At other points, Manji’s use of granular synthesis imbues the project with a cybernetic cohesion, from the glitched-out noise in “Pitch Black” to the misty vocal grains that eddy around “Closer to Midnight.” The conflation of human and machine that is implied in the construction of their music might be an articulation of what Legacy Russell calls “ ,” in which “liberation can be found within the fissures between gender, technology, and the body.” Lead single “Body/Prison” explores that idea: “A hologram of lies is trying to own me and I can’t escape/ A body that’s not mine and I can’t escape,” they sing, lamenting a certain projection of gender identity as an airy trance progression floats unfettered by percussion. Manji seems to transcend the shackles of the body by conducting these computer-assisted experiments in sound. With  , Manji set out to ask “what elements of ourselves might be for endurance, and what might just be decoration,” per the liner notes. While the effervescent electronics that adorn the album may seem inessential, for Manji it’s perhaps precisely within these sounds, unbound by the strictures of melody and rhythm, that they find survival.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/evita-manji-spandrel-review"}

The artist—who is primarily known as a member of the ska band Heavy Manners—moved from New York City to Chicago in the late 1970s. ”I pretty much came to visit Chicago and fell in love with the scene and never left,” says Fagan, who found solace in the Windy City, separated from the teetering and pretentious social climb of New York’s pseudo-bougie crowd. “At the time, I’d been working at   and was getting dismayed watching the CBGB scene give way to the whole Studio 54 and velvet rope thing.” Fagan’s song “I Don’t Wanna Be Too Cool” was fueled by the disdain she had for the clout-chaser popularity game: the clothes to be seen in, the drugs to line up, and the places to perch for photographs. “I don’t wanna be too cool/ I don’t know no rock stars, I don’t snort the good stuff, I don’t really care, I’m just not impressed,” she sings with an air of detachment. “I know it’s only chemical,” she concludes, with a sneer that is sharp with disinterest, much like the vocal style of The Waitresses’ Patty Donahue. In Chicago, where New York’s club-going, drug-sniffing charlatans could not be found, Fagan scrounged up money for a cheap bass guitar and began writing music without any formal training. The result was the 1981 seven-inch single for “I Don’t Wanna Be Too Cool” on the Chicago imprint  , which found popularity amongst local DJs—and even became a bestseller in the infamous Wax Trax! record store. The vinyl’s flip side “Waiting For the Crisis” is an anti-war, Reagan-era straight shooter. With its one-note piano repetition, the simplicity of the two-minute song boils in tension as the tongue-in-cheek lyrics duke it out with stiff guitar lines. Originally, the reissue of the seven-inch included two unreleased tracks by Fagan that were part of  , her autobiographical romantic rock opera. “Master of Passion,” doused in a scuzzy drum machine beat and bright synthesizer accents, feels as much Italo-disco as it does new wave. Fagan’s lustful voice tells of a quixotic dancefloor affair as she sings, “I can hear you calling me/ As I run through the fire.” If properly released forty years ago, the song, replete with all its pop markings, would have certainly been a dance chart hit. The complimentary track “Come Over” is reminiscent of the cute, pastel-soaked punk perfected by The Go-Gos. In its bubblegum fantasy, Fagan’s twinkling synths and daydreamy lyrics (“Can you come over, be with me?/ I love to write you poetry”) display a softer side of the artist. Captured Tracks’   includes four additional songs that were written for  . With the 1980s amplitude of an aerobic workout, “Cover It Up” bursts with a hyper beat and extravagant chorus—think   or Olivia Newton-John in a shiny leotard—while “Say It” is awash in lo-fi sincerity with its organ stabs and reverberated guitar lines (it was produced by reggae mainstay   alongside Bob Marley’s guitarist Donald Kinsey, after all).  captures a moment in time when punk guitars clashed with electronic machines, when the upper class mingled with Lower East Side artists amidst the fog and lasers of the club.

Guadeloupean native Polobi, now 70, has seen plenty of such storms in his lifetime and is aware of that natural power, and the frailty of human life in the face of such storms. So it’s fitting that he names his debut album  , making music that embraces and emulates both the gentlest splendors of the natural world around him and cognizance of its true brutal force. From a young age, Polobi fell under the sway of  , the creolized music originating from the island, a rhythmic sound that can be traced back to the 1600s, as born from the Trans-Atlantic slave trade in the Caribbean. As a child, he witnessed gwoka master   in performance and took to the music, rhythms, and ritualistic dance. But it was only in late 2020 that Polobi’s own songs were finally heard beyond the ​​confines of the lush forest surrounding his home. It was still the high tide of the pandemic, but Polobi left isolation to join a jam session at his neighbor’s house. That neighbor, percussionist (and noted collaborator for the likes of  ,    ) Klod Kiavué was struck by Polobi’s singular, rough-hewn songs, determined to bring them to a wider audience. Gwoka rhythms still power the songs here, but   pushes this music into a heady fusion that finds shards of Cuban  , modal jazz from the Americas, and dizzying dub from Jamaica. A crawling stand-up bassline and glints of metallophone underpin “Kawmélito,” while gentle Bill Evans–like piano chords entwine with gnarled feedback on the slow and spacious “Mendémélé.” Wood flutes are processed until they trill like birdsong on “Camargo.” Additional electronic effects from   (who has had a hand in a  and Mbongwana Star) dilates the soundstage with timely dub effects that make the rhythms warp into new shapes. At the center of it all is Polobi’s well-deep voice, bearing a gravitas that can bring to mind   or the gravelly chants of   And while the album title is about the force of nature and ecological disaster, Polobi is just as content to sing in Creole about little details, be it trapping   (freshwater prawns), worn-down footwear, or reclaiming the yellow cycling jersey of the Tour de Guadeloupe.   strikes a balance between an ancient drum beat and modern music-making, between a massive hurricane and the ripples of an   escaping capture, with Polobi finding an intimate space between it all.", "genre": ["World"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/polobi-the-gwo-ka-masters-abri-cyclonique-review"}

Here, “ABC” stands for Ahvagene Bond Clarke, Lee’s grandmother and a university-trained pianist with perfect pitch.   features 19 recordings, some of them 40 years old, of Clarke’s grandmother playing and singing popular songs, mostly from the mid-20th century. These recordings are casual and homemade; listening to them feels more like looking through a stranger’s old photos than listening to an album. Listening to  , however, feels like doing both of those things at the same time. It’s the first full-length project from Clarke, a Philadelphia-based producer who previously released a promising   in 2020. He followed that with a series of singles featuring collaborations with fellow Philly artists   and  , which showcased Clarke’s knack for richly constructed beats. On  , he uses samples of his music, as well as of Ahvagene and her sisters singing, talking, and playing piano, to create a set of compelling beats that feel hyper-personal, especially with the   compilation as context. Clarke’s tracks pack a punch in a short amount of time. “Can’t Sleep” is 70 seconds of glowing tones set to an arrhythmic beat that sounds like   unbuckled in the back of a moving box truck. Opener “Dwight Likes Jazz” is barely over a minute long, but its combo of subaquatic dub and a fluttering horn line sets an ultra-cool tone for the rest of the tape. The longer tracks are no less effective. “One More” is Clarke in quiet-storm mode, using breathy sampled vocals and liquid string sounds to build an alien R&B jam; twinkling piano and brushed drums make “Two Chords” the jazziest song on the album; and “This Life In Space” uses its nearly four-minute lifespan to evolve from a melancholy vibe to a woozy, weird dance-floor banger and back again. It’s a short sonic journey that neatly summarizes one of Clarke’s strengths as a producer: He’s a wandering spirit who never gets lost in his own sauce. Occasionally, Ahvagene Clarke’s voice emerges from her grandson’s gentle river of sound to drop a little wisdom or tell a funny story. “By that time, there were so many of us who played the piano,” she says in “Morphing Gene,” a murky mid-album interlude, “That our piano was going from morning till night.” It’s moments like these that make   feel like a threadbare peek into Lee Clarke’s existence—a lasting reminder of life’s impermanence and the enduring impact of love.", "genre": ["Electronic", "beat tape"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/lee-clarke-genes-review"}

Nina wastes no time flexing her well-honed pen game, artfully alluding to the first track’s title “Lougie,” by rhyming and alliterating her way around it: “Skip to my lougie/ Spit it and roll me a doobie/ If life a movie mine a indie/ Make you woozy/ Shit is a doozy/ I’m dizzy who gone pursue me/ You something to me truly/ You manage to move me.” The start to the album is striking in its urgency, pushing listeners to anticipate what’s coming next. In “Weeping Waltz,” an open snare beat with a flavor of ballroom boom bap displays the paradox that comes with how it’s “been hard to tell who to tell what I go through.” There’s a somber quality to the ascending electronic blips as the song showcases the depth of emotions inherent to life. Thematically, the refrain of “Weeping while I waltz” underscores the mourning that is central to the album’s theme. The theme of grief comes back with “Sorrel Sip,” co-produced with   (fka Jon Bap): “Sit with my sorrow, drinking some sorrel/ Deep in a quarrel had me a quarter.” Nina ensures that there’s a balance to the exploration of grief by one-upping herself bar for bar.

But while  gained a kaleidoscopic flair from its different players and sessions, this album focuses on one band across 18 bracing songs and feels equally rewarding. It allows new and returning contributors to explore exciting interplay, such as pedal steel guitarist Eric Kinny and saxophonist Johannes Eimermacher, whose solos beautifully overlap on closer “Clues Not To Read.” Recorded live in a single night,   captures the momentum of those live performances while feeling like a strong example of Phillips’ “open session rock” recording philosophy. The album also builds even more on the compositional partnership between Phillips and Clément, whose strength for creating impossibly complex arrangements and powerful, heart-stirring melodies complement each other wonderfully. Clément’s nimble, dynamic vocals lead songs like “Save the Phenomenon,” “Days of Pleasure,” and “4000 Rooms” that carry lovely hooks while rippling with almost fractal-like layers of rhythms and harmonies. Other highlights like the atmospheric “Boîte à Serpents,” “Porn of Love,” and “Constantly Rare” demonstrate that same balance at a slower pace and fit into the ebb and flow of the album’s live recording. In one of the album’s few, well-placed skits—taken from old, dubbed films in a move that surprisingly recalls Wu-Tang Clan—a swordsman and a poet reflect on their envy for one another’s paths.

Ever since, they’ve been among the premier practitioners of  , the utterly singular blend of prog, jazz, and Wagnerian opera that originated in the early ‘70s by French freaks   and eventually  . The band’s third album   came barreling into being in 2001, and was tweaked in 2009 with overdubs by the latest lineup. Now a newly revisited   has been remixed, remastered, re-sequenced, and given its first-ever vinyl version. What emerges is a beast that bears the original release’s blend of maniacal precision and brute force but adds some new mojo all its own. With Yoshida as its fulcrum and only constant, Koenjihyakkei has always taken the first-gen vision of zeuhl—a genre synonymous with visceral power—and intensified it a thousandfold into an unrelenting assault on the senses. While   doesn’t quite bear the demonic, sulfur-infused vibe of vintage Magma, it quadruples down on the knuckle-busting, prog/fusion side of things. From the breakneck frenzy of “Lussesoggi Zomn” and “Vissqguell” to the knotty, Zappa-like twists and turns of “Vallczeremdoss” and the merciless slam of “Maschtervoz” and “Gassitrumm,” the band executes death-defying riffs and time changes with such intensity, it’s a wonder the players survived the sessions. As their spellcheck-immune song titles attest, Koenjihyakkei emulates Magma by singing in a self-invented language, frequently in strident, sinister choral arrangements that make it sound like a phalanx of Valkyries on winged serpents descending from the sky. In between all the punishing rhythms and dizzying riffs, the band sometimes switches things up by adding some wild avant-jazz progressions, but nowhere on   will you encounter anything like a respite from the sonic carnage. The remastering makes it seem like the whole album has gone from black and white to blazing, retina-searing Technicolor, and the remix goes far beyond topping off the treble or bulking up the bottom end. It brings in elements that were completely absent before, like the foreboding guitar riffs on the title track’s chaotic coda or the vocals leading into the cataclysmic climax of “Gassttrumm.” If that’s not enough, we get live 2020 bonus versions of three tracks, which add a whole new perspective. The live take on “Nivraym,” for instance, shifts the focus from keyboards to angry guitar and expands things considerably with a spacy, almost Gong-like middle section. Like the rest of Koenjihyakkei’s catalog,  isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s got a lot to offer zeuhl zealots and anyone else with a taste for extremes. Even those who’ve internalized the album’s earlier versions may find this go-round to be something of a revelation.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/koenjihyakkei-nivraym-revisited-review"}

With previous releases  (2015) and   (2017), the enigmatic artist has incorporated collaboration into every step of her creative process. Peruse through the liner notes of each album and you’ll often find multiple co-writers and producers credited per track—everyone from stadium-pop introvert   of  to avant-garde behemoth . For her latest LP  , Kelela expands her circle of confidants with a stellar guest list including , , , , and . But this collectivist spirit has evolved into a commitment to building community,   becoming a space through which to honor and amplify Black voices, queer love, and disenfranchised ancestors long owed their due. Raven is far less preoccupied with form than its predecessors. Songs bleed into one another and walls of synth textures transmute into waves—at times crashing violently, at others trickling in faint, enveloping murmurs. Water is a recurring motif across the album, a mirror for the ebb and flow of emotion stirring within. Raven’s striking monochrome cover shows a face emerging from water, echoing the immersive sensory loop of bookend tracks “Washed Away” and “Far Away,” which encourage repeated, increasingly deeper dives. Kelela’s principle is also one of organic sculpture, blunting and rounding techno’s jagged edges in the throbbing back-to-back of “Raven” and “Bruises.” Rigid beat structures bend to her will with ease, delivering a swift reminder that even today’s most artificial electronic genres were once rooted in soulful, undeniably human music crafted by Black producers in Chicago and Detroit. Though the storytelling across   treads familiar territory of love, lust, and heartbreak, each song feels like an individual case study of the privilege—or lack there of—inherent in sensual touch and emotional availability. “I’m reading all the writings on the wall/ And if you don’t run away/ Could be a happy ending after all,” she sings on Jersey club–tinged single “Happy Ending,” fatigued by chasing after an ideal that lives only in her head. The chase continues in “On The Run,” where she pleads with a paramour to “open up, babe,” calling the bluff of a guarded heart over minimalist Afrobeats. “Contact” is simultaneously the prime example of longing and joy on  , as Kelela buzzes from the lingering adrenaline of a night on the dance floor. It’s not the tunes that set her hips ablaze, but the potential for physicality; unspoken fulfillment of a primal hunger that burns in her belly. Kelela suggests that throwing ass and falling in love are universal constants, but the touch of lips on your skin is never more precious than right now.", "genre": ["Electronic", "R&B"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kelela-raven-review"}

A teenager records a cluster of songs, bent over his guitar in the attic of his parents’ home. The teenager lives in Hebden Bridge, a small town just west of Leeds caught in a moment of transition. It’s not yet become   and the hippies; it is, however, in the throes of industrial decline following the closure of Acre Mill, the local asbestos processing factory. The economic pains are immediate, but the human toll comes into focus more slowly. In 1976, a public advocate   that 12% of 2,200 former employees suffer from debilitating asbestos-related diseases. Someone paints “ ” on the side of the shuttered brick building. Demolition orders eventually follow, and by the end of 1979, all that’s left is an empty lot. The teenager’s songs disappear too. But that all comes later. Suspended in this peculiar in-between moment of the early 1970s is Trevor Beales, the latest entry in the long folk tradition of being discovered decades late and with nary a Google result to their name. Responsible for this discovery is  , a small contemporary folk label based in nearby Todmorden.   is the label’s first release by a non-working songwriter, and it is, at its best, remarkable. Although you’d never know his age from the world-weary character of his voice, this is the work of a young songwriter seeking a musical identity by trying out several. He begins with dark and detailed narratives. Album opener “Marion Belle” is an evocative tale of mariners adrift upon the waves and within their own hearts; “Tell Me Now” is a harrowing one about a farmer’s son accused of raping and murdering the mayor’s daughter. His assumed guilt is rooted in the class divide: “Such a girl of respect would never have let/ A mere farmer make love to and court her.” “Sunlight on the Table” is the opposite of a narrative, however, which is to say it’s a song in which nothing happens. Beales fixates instead on the minutiae of a single, interior moment: “Silence in the corridors, a slow tide in my mind/ A mist made up of memories of the ones I left behind.” A talented player by any standard, he attempts a playful Latin experiment on the instrumental “Braziliana.” But the energized album finale “Fireside Stories” may be the standout. He hits every impassioned downstrum with fervor and combines sharpened, singular stanzas—“If your jewels make you sparkle/ And your wine makes you glow/ And my words taste so bitter/ And you’ve learned all there is to know”—with a catalog of momentary images marked by a sensory vividness. It’s easy to imagine him, pen in hand, noting down the “creaking rocking chair and thick velvet curtains and the smell of the pinewood walls.” As such,   captures a gifted and otherwise-forgotten songwriter in amber. Finally dug out of the attic and dusted off, it shines in the light of day.", "genre": ["Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/trevor-beales-fireside-stories-hebden-bridge-1971-1974-review"}
{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0030201820_2.jpg", "album": "Everything Returns", "artist": "Black Ox Orkestar", "description": "Montréal post-everything quartet   has always dealt in a sort of cultural timelessness. Thierry Amar (bass), Scott Gilmore (cimbalom, piano, vocals), Gabriel Levine (clarinet, guitar, vocals), and Jessica Moss (violin, vocals) first got together at the turn of the century to create what they refer to as modern Jewish diasporic folk music, with lyrics mostly in Yiddish. Listening to 2004’s revelatory debut  , and the equally fantastic 2006 follow-up  , it’s easy to imagine them popping up in history as a jazz band or a Balkan folk outfit, a Yiddish theater troupe, or participants in the North American   of the ’70s and ’80s. By melding these disparate threads of the Jewish diaspora together, and applying a fresh coat of post-punk polish, the band arrives at a hauntingly beautiful sound. , Black Ox Orkestar’s new album, marks their first full-length since 2006, and only their second recording since returning from a 15-year hiatus. While the name of the album is a reference to the idea that so much of the past is here again—its liner notes address the refugee crisis and re-emergence of fascism around the world—this is also certainly a bit of a tongue-in-cheek comment about the band reuniting. While there have been   contextualizing the history and culture of Judaism within DIY music—examples include  ,  , and many of the artists on John Zorn’s Tzadik Records, from   to Deveykus—what Black Ox Orkestar is doing has always felt very unique, and  is no exception. This is Jewish music,   (a term that roughly translates as “Jewishness”), presented in a way that can be enjoyed both by those with strong connections to the community and those from outside it. There’s a good reason that the band’s first release since reuniting was a 7-inch flexi that went out to subscribers of the magazine  , which describes itself as “committed to the rich tradition of thought, activism, and culture of the Jewish left.” That being said, a knowledge of Judaism isn’t necessary to be able to appreciate what Black Ox is doing, though everyone would benefit from reading the extensive liner notes. Lyrically, Black Ox draws on universal themes of exile, anti-fascism, and the intricacies of identity. Radical politics have also played an outsized role in their message and mission.   touches on topics including war, immigration, generational trauma, and popular uprisings across the globe, sometimes all in the same song. For example, in “Mizrakh Mi Ma’arav,” the band parallels the deportation of Jews during the Holocaust to concentration camps in the East with the plight of Syrians desperately trying to flee that country’s ongoing civil war to the West. As the narrator of the song shifts from one to the other, so does the language the band is singing in, as well as the music itself. The result is a kind of mosaic, juxtaposing notes and words from across Europe and the Middle East in a heady whirlwind of Yiddish and Arabic,   clarinet, and a violin that would sound just as much at home on a  . Even if you don’t understand Yiddish (or Hebrew, Arabic, French, and English, the other languages on the record) it’s clear just from listening to these songs that so much of this album is a celebration of continued existence. It might sound melancholy at times but really so is life. The overall tone, the spirit of the music, it’s one of hope for a better tomorrow. The final two tracks are a perfect example of that: a Moldovan  , a type of Jewish folk dance, is followed up by “Lamed-Vovnik a cabaret-like jazz tune about the Jewish legend of the   who keep the world in order and how we are always one misstep away from destruction. The album ends with Gilmore repeating “everything falls” in English, words that serve as both a reminder as well as a kind of prayer to try and break the cycles of trauma that rule so much of our lives. Everything falls. But also, everything returns.", "genre": ["Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/black-ox-orkestar-everything-returns-review"}

The visionary guitarist has always been a restless musical tinkerer, and   has long served as his grandest laboratory.  , the first Hammers record in six years, sees Cobbett welcoming Jamie Myers and Mike Scalzi (in a guest vocalist role) back into the fold for the first time since 2006’s  , but the similarities to that album mostly end there.  was exploratory and complex, but its Iraq War-era lyrical concerns and the vividly captured interplay between its Bay Area-based players anchored it in something that felt real and immediate. This latest iteration of Hammers looks skyward instead, slipping the surly bonds of Earth for a psychedelic prog-thrash journey through the cosmos. If that sounds familiar to fans of  , the sci-fi thrashers that Cobbett co-led with Yob’s Mike Scheidt, that’s entirely fair. Cobbett wrote the bulk of  without a specific band in mind, and at times, the material seems to split the difference between Hammers and VHÖL. On the Hammers side, there’s the insistent warble of mellotron and organ, split between Cobbett and Sigrid Sheie. On the VHÖL side, there’s the reckless, hurtling tempos and the rhythmically diabolical riffage. Cobbett has said that he envisioned  as a combination of Sadus and Genesis. That’s truly bonkers, but the band makes it work. The Scalzi-featuring “Dark Brennius” and lead single “Don’t Follow the Lights” prove instructive in understanding what Cobbett and his collaborators are doing here. Both open with beautifully played clean guitar passages, not so distant from the proggy AOR balladry of past Hammers songs like “Summer Tears” and “Here Comes the Sky.” Both, too, are soon split open like John Hurt in  , their chests caved in by dexterous thrash riffs and battering drums. Elements tend to pile up rather than making room for one another, so at their climaxes, the songs become almost overwhelmingly dense, with guitars, bass, synth, mellotron, drums, and multiple vocalists layered in a throbbing, awe-inspiring mass.

He even built a phony   website to host it. The piece was intended as art—a conversation about gatekeepers, since the plagiarized sentences could have just as easily been about Shirt instead of Jay Electronica and A$AP Rocky. But that wasn’t the conversation at the time. No one praised his creativity as “Duchampian”— . Instead, he was marginalized as a   troll; at best, clever at marketing ploys. All performative stunts must be treated equally, right? It’s 2022. What do we make of Drake and 21 Savage’s sham   cover? Surely, there are more flags on the field besides a   from Condé Nast. Why is one provocative and the other desperate? The gatekeepers of art are still in Shirt’s crosshairs on . Over the baroque strings of “Marni Invisibility Cloak,” he’s not rapping so much as thinking out loud: “Many artists are not easily pigeonholed as being only one thing.” Later, on “Death to Wall Art,” Shirt confronts the status quo, the supposed “revolutions” being treated as art movements: “Don’t show me a corny NFT of a shark/ Go   with sharks/ Kill a shark.” Welcome to the woodshed, where Shirt works out his frustrations with art and art-making. The album is built on the poet and professor  ; essentially, all great writing is behind us, so our only choice is to recontextualize what already exists. For Shirt, the “uncreative” practice has resulted in gallery exhibitions that transpose the layout of experimental arts journal  ’s ( ) 1922 cover with the query   or interpolating   into a canvas that reads   like Bart Simpson at the chalkboard.   turns these same ideas into lyrics. “Dave Chappelle Is Wrong” brings the aphorism “art is dangerous” to life over a menacing baritone sax loop and a thumping backbeat. His first words on the song—and the album—are, “The ones willing to kill everyone/ Is the ones in charge” before admonishing that Chappelle’s jokes “…put people in danger/ The dummies think it’s funny/ I think you should be more careful who you make comfy.” Explaining the album’s concept feels flagrantly academic, if not the antithesis of rap music. And the album itself would be, if Shirt and Jack Splash hadn’t thoroughly immersed it in Queens boom bap. “718 To The World” flips the McCoy Tyner loop from Black Sheep’s “The Choice Is Yours (Revisited),” yet it feels refreshing rather than redundant, while “Cancel Culture” recalls  ’s breakthrough work with Prodigy. Of course, the Chappelle commentary—like his Duchampian plagiarism of Caramanica—won’t be met with universal applause, and not everyone will be tweeting how Shirt is brave for speaking truth to power. The mention of an “invisibility cloak” suggests he’s painfully aware of this, and chooses to recast it as a superpower. Marginalize him if you like; it’s not stopping Shirt from making art.

On   Sierra Leonean DJ and producer   explores a different set of priorities for his electronic compositions. Throughout the album, Fofana creates subtle, ambient compositions that are tools for meditating on climate change and the ecological destruction capitalism has wrought. Dynamic and texturally rich,   is electronic music that articulates both the complexity of the natural world and our pernicious relationship to it. The album opens with “Tune Of Departure,” a lovely, minute-long overture that sets the tone and introduces listeners to the world of sound that   conjures. Clocking in at nearly 12 minutes of running time, “A Symbol of the Withdraw God Redux” is a vast, foreboding work of sound. The repeated central motif casts a foreboding dark over the piece, while synth pads provide a counterbalance of light. “Erosion / Whispers ‘a laminated shout’” is a drifting, understated track that feels like the slow, inevitable movement of time. Beneath the primary drone that guides the tune, more subtle percussive elements emerge to provide a faint suggestion of rhythm. “Broken Time Of Transition” is a brief melodic piece built around a lone, staccato kick drum. The drum’s thump acts as a heartbeat or an anchor for the bird song–like melody. In less than two minutes, “Broken Time Of Transition” gives way to “Rehearsal Of Truth,” a dreamy synth and vocal piece that is drenched in static. The album’s closer “Oily (Resurfacing)” is a lowkey techno track that pushes the album’s sound into a more overtly rhythmic, danceable territory. Given the album’s heavy subject matter, perhaps there is some significance in ending the album on such an upbeat note. Although there are no words to articulate this sentiment, there is a hint of optimism to be heard within the driving beats on “Oily (Resurfacing),” assuring listeners that the dance of life will continue despite human destructiveness.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/lamin-fofana-unsettled-scores-review"}

Beauty Pill creative leader Chad Clark had found success in the early-to-mid-1990s with his  -signed band  , occupying the same sort of agitated/frenzied space as other artists on that label’s roster, but with Beauty Pill, he joined the ranks of forward-thinking acts like   and  —whom Clark had worked with at the legendary studio   as a producer and engineer—to redefine the parameters of what could be considered “punk” in the early aughts. On 2004’s  , Clark and the band favored relatively subdued and lush studio experiments rather than raw, guitar-heavy post-hardcore. It was a move that puzzled fans of his early work and seemed to fly over the heads of critics looking to make sense of this artistic pivot. It took almost a decade for Clark to release more music with Beauty Pill, finally venturing into electronic-leaning art-rock with 2015’s . Though that album was universally loved upon its arrival, in subsequent years more people have continued coming around to their equally exciting yet misunderstood earlier releases, which have now been collected by   onto a double LP entitled   showcasing Clark and the band’s masterful knack for softening rigid genre signifiers long before they were heralded for doing so. This collection contains the entirety of Beauty Pill’s recorded output with Dischord from 2003 to 2005, including   and the   EP, as well as previously unreleased outtakes and demos. While the set is a revelation for longtime fans who were never able to enjoy this material on vinyl (it was released solely on CD), for newcomers, listening to this material in sequence recontextualizes Beauty Pill as a band ahead of their time and adventurous soothsayers of the current genre-borrowing, free-for-all approach now commonly accepted in punk and indie rock circles. The skittering shuffle of “Such Large Portions!” sung by co-vocalist and co-writer Rachel Burke, owes as much to My Bloody Valentine in its warped chorus as much as it does to the racket happening during D.C.’s famed  . Elsewhere, the minimal, propulsive bass and drums of “Terrible Things” provide a tense bedrock for Clark to explain the origins of evildoers like John Lennon assassin Mark David Chapman and genocidal dictator Idi Amin while warning that fear is not something to succumb to but rather a motivating factor for change. For those missing the crashing guitars of Clark’s earlier band,   title track is a blistering reminder that he can still write a knock-down-drag-out anthem, rich with interesting left-turns as good as any of his peers. As forward-thinking as the Beauty Pill’s released material is, it’s the outtakes included on   that provide the most fascinating glimpse into the band’s creative process. Hearing an early demo of  ‘s motorik opener, “Goodnight For Real,” presents the song in its sparest form, showing how willing Clark and Beauty Pill were to push the arrangements on the song, and the rest of the album, to achieve their final vision. It still sounds futuristic 20 years later.", "genre": ["Rock", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/beauty-pill-blue-period-review"}

On the newly reissued  , the Charallave, Venezuela-raised bandleader falls in and out of love with a new woman every time the trombones start up again. And if the four girls in hot pants lounging on its cover were not sufficient proof, then listen to the man himself. In a recent interview shared by El Palmas, the Barcelona label responsible for the reissue: “I dedicated [the album] to women because one always has the tendency to do things for them.” Indeed one does. And one suspects that Urbina is the most lethal of seducers, one who — to borrow from (bear with me) the  sequel — “genuinely falls in love every evening, only to fall out of it again the next morning.” As such, Moncho y Su Banda’s salsa is passionate and deliciously brassy but light on its feet. Sharpened by years on the Venezuelan club circuit, the band is tight as can be, but loosened up by the sambuca that allegedly flowed during studio sessions. Case in point: the rhapsodic piano interlude on album opener “Olvidame,” the harmony tossed over to the trombones at just the right moment. And true to its genre and its historical moment, it’s shot through with sweeping emotion. The specific juxtaposition of musical liveliness with lyrics expressing desperation, devastation, and the like is analogous to the 20th century Latin American experience — carrying on, not unpleasantly, amidst an unstable sociopolitical climate. Venezuela of the ‘60s and ‘70s was no exception, still reeling from the Marcos Pérez Jiménez-led military dictatorship and flush with the cash and corruption that inevitably accompany sitting atop enormous oil reserves. Salsa responded in kind, sometimes politically.  ’s dramatic emotional and music shifts, however, are almost exclusively directed toward the fairer sex. (That said, the band’s singers swell with Venezuelan pride and promise to do right by his country on the title track. Although they also remember to mention that Venezuelan girls are stunning and dance the best rumba.) On “Las 12,” he is forlorn as he watches the front door, desperate and clingy the moment she finally returns, then sours on her before the song is over. He’d die without her love on “Alma Rosa”; he bemoans her jealous ways on “La Envidia.” He considers fighting a married woman’s husband after getting lost in her smile (and then some) on “El Amor de una Mujer”.

It’s meditative at points, similar to the way   was on  . It eschews choruses and standard-issue pop song structures. Marlody is no moralist, although she can be an existentialist. Her muse for “Malevolence” is the imp of the perverse, and its hypomanic major key cheeriness borders on abrasive. “Wrong” is about an extramarital affair and one of several songs addressing a profound loss and a psychological crisis of not-insignificant magnitude: “There’s no right/ There’s no wrong/ There’s only the way it was going to be.” Maybe so. The aftermath, the wreckage, the leftovers, the tinge of memory, the dust-covered surface—that’s what Marlody is most interested in here. She regrets certain things, stacking her vocals and repeating “I’m so sorry now” and “I don’t want to be this way” on “Words.” She is largely disinterested in any real resolutions or lessons to be drawn, let alone learned from. She doesn’t know  . Maybe she never intends to find out  . It says so right there on the cover. Her emotional desolation has a poetic quality, as does her languishing in the ambiguity of it all. Perhaps T.S. Eliot said it best, as he typically does, when he wrote “Between the conception/ And the creation/ Between the emotion/ And the response/ Falls the Shadow.”   is woven in and from this poetic shadow, surrounded by death and despair but no less beautiful for it.

Yeah, it’s a bloody, vulnerable mess, but it’s real, it’s still beating, and there’s the will to keep moving. Building on her last full-length, 2018’s  , and her work in the part punk, part multimedia performance band, Evil Sword, she continues reveling in the subterranean study of lo-fi sounds. Her music, which sways between curious synth explorations and folk-tinged punk, has little in the way of polish; instead, her fascination lies in the dings and scrapes of each song’s imperfection, further underlining the mental clutter she carries with her. Ferencz’s work thrives on the brutal, naked honesty found in life’s sorrowful monotony. I need that magic now,” she pleads in the opening track “Can You Heal Me.” “I don’t know if I’ve ever been this sad.” Her lyrics are odds with the whimsical nature of the music; what seems playful and nostalgic at first is soon blackened by grief. The whirr and hum of her songs create a detachment, a muddiness: “Take Me Away” is built upon a chaotic loop of filtered nebulous noise, while “She Stopped Making Art” is a faded and distorted lullaby reserved solely for nightmares. But there’s bravery in Ferencz’s delivery. Like the 1980s no-wave debutante  , Ferencz’s dry and unapologetic vocals trip over her clunky emotional baggage, but she always manages to land on her feet. “I’m A Monster,” in all its controlled pandemonium, emphasizes Ferencz’s ability to shove together abstract elements such as sample loops, erratic synthesizer lines, and bellowing, mangled sounds as the undercurrent for her voice’s disorienting mise-en-scene: I might be doing worse than I let on.” The grungy gunk of “Hate Your Car” feels like a tantrum in all its weighty fuzz. Conversely, “Violence” operates under the guise of lightheartedness with its adolescent polyphonic music box tune. By juxtaposing the lyrics’ sobering truths with the music’s childlike fragility, Ferencz introduces an uncanny element to her otherwise straightforward confessionals, a subversive twist that consistently pays off. Noted as “some kind of catharsis” by Ferencz herself,   grapples with the stinging bitterness of existence—”The world is going to hell,” she admits on “She Stopped Making Art.” It is the real-time suffering of an individual shown through a blurry analog screen. But the purgative artistic process bears a sprig of hope near the end, and by “The Holidays,” she is finally ready to receive and to give love again. “Everyday I try to do some normal stuff,” she sings. “Almost anything is better than just giving up.” The acceptance of her mistakes, the modesty with which she admits them, the flawed, beautiful soundscapes surrounding them: it all adds up to something truly admirable.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kate-ferencz-you-will-love-again-review"}

The mechanism allowed the listener to seamlessly switch from one side of a cassette to the other without expending the effort to physically eject and turn the tape over. On  ’s eighth solo album   that feature has been honored as a key part of the title. Fittingly, the album is written in the present, but anchored in the past, as if the MC is flitting between two worlds without ever breaking the musical spell. Snippets of archived radio interviews and commercials—lifted from mixtapes that Eagle made back in the late ’90s, while listening to hip-hop shows on Chicago college station WHPK—bolster the nostalgia. The fuzzy shorts bring a collage-like quality to the album, acting as prompts that inspire autobiographical songs that detail Eagle’s relocation to Los Angeles (“Crenshaw And Homeland”) and pay homage to a rich lineage of Chicago MCs (“79th and Stony Island”). The album’s guest list further builds on the mixtape concept, adding a collegial feel that’s epitomized by the rousing closing cut “CD Only Bonus Track,” where golden era producer-on-the-mic Diamond D joins forces with lyrical trickster  . (The song also includes a reference to the once-coveted yellow Sony sports Walkman.) A more recent rumination comes on “Peak Lockdown Raps” where Eagle revisits the isolation and disorientation of early COVID-19. Swaddled by rustling distortion and nestled between a bittersweet synth refrain from production duo  , a hushed Eagle recalls how “art on my wall is framed virtual ticket stubs” and considers the idea that “the year didn’t happen.” On “I Retired Then I Changed My Mind,” the MC details how his Comedy Central show   was unceremoniously canceled. The emotional peak of  is “For DOOM,” dedicated to the memory of cult rap supervillain  , whose passing was made public on December 31, 2020. “Got two songs with you but only spoke to a go-between,” raps Eagle over producer  ‘s comfort blanket of a beat, “But still proud as fuck to reach ground zero/ ‘Cause who the fuck ever gets to rock with their heroes?” He then confesses to rewriting his verse on CZARFACE and DOOM’s “Phantoms” more than once, weaving in allusions to the KMD songs “Sweet Premium Wine” and “Peachfuzz.” “For DOOM” ends with Eagle staring at a piece of art in his living room that he’d always assumed featured DOOM. But then comes the realization: “I memorized your lyrics and seen every interview/ I look into the eyes of the piece: He ain’t really you.” The line is a nod to the rumors that DOOM would send masked imposters to perform on his behalf at live shows, but it serves another purpose in the song; it allows Eagle to blur together sepia-toned memories with cold reality in a way that sums up the album’s main theme: Nostalgia is mostly what we want to make it.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/open-mike-eagle-a-tape-called-component-system-with-the-auto-reverse-review"}

As a gay Black musician who struggled through poverty and long bouts of homelessness, Eastman was firmly disconnected from the social and economic class privileges that many experimental musicians enjoy. Despite this, Eastman and the music that he created were connected to something much greater. With their hypnotic rhythms; harmonic and melodic inventiveness; and a deep sense of spirit, Eastman’s compositions demand acknowledgment as part of a rich and old tradition of Black experimental music. Today, his name is remembered alongside forward-thinking Black musicians like  ,  ,  , , and others. On   London-based musician electronic   interprets Eastman’s music with a sensitivity and a distinctly modern flair. In a delightful sleight of hand, the album opens with “Maybe If I (Stay On It),” with James transforming Eastman’s joyous, euphoric string piece into a darker, sensuous song. “The Perception of Me (Crazy N—)” is a dreamy take on Eastman’s landmark composition “Crazy N—.” Here, James’ gorgeous synth lines and chords dipped in reverb and delay. Anchoring the piece, the synths are subtle, patient, and evocative, wringing every bit of emotion out of the piece. “Choose To Be Gay (Femenine)” is built are billowing synth pads and James’ voice.  “Enfield, Always” ups the tempo, opening with a tight four-on-the-floor kick drum and bright, plucky synths. Here, the similarities between James’ and Eastman’s styles meet beautifully across the gulf of time and space. Both masters at constructing relentless rhythms, Eastman’s and James’ respective musical pulses occupy “Enfield, Always,” resulting in a driving, hypnotizing track. “Black Excellence (Stay On It)” offers another take on Eastman’s original piec, “Stay On It.” With its sweeping synth arpeggios, “Black Excellence (Stay On It)” twists, contorts and eventually builds to a furious climax before settling into a ghostly closing section. With  , James provides a fresh new context for Eastman’s work. These compositions are not covered as much as they are completely reframed as James adds the emotional elements of contemporary soul music and the textural characteristic of electronic music to Eastman’s minimalist classical works. Full of intriguing sound design and compositional ideas, James gifts listeners with a new way of hearing Eastman’s work. As tragic as it is that Eastman died in relative obscurity, perhaps works like this can act as a small consolation. It is a pleasure to hear a contemporary musician tackling the music of one of the great, unheralded composers to walk the earth in our time.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/loraine-james-building-something-beautiful-for-me-review"}

The album opens with “Ani,” a groovy, breezy love song where Hakim presents love as an ongoing dialogue of shared passion and discovery. “Ani wanna feel love, glad I found her/ She opened up her heart and showed me what’s inside her.” With its crunchy drums, waves of delay, and a vicious,  -style burst of guitar noise that enters toward the end, “Ani” is also a sonically odd delight. “Happen” begins with a flourish of dreamy psychedelic organs before settling into a slow, strummed-guitar groove. Hakim delivers the song’s lyrics in a near whisper: “The sweetest angel fell into my world/ She gives me reason/…Was lost for a damn long time.” The dreamy “Vertigo” is built around a gentle guitar riff and a half-time electronic beat. Hakim’s voice is particularly dextrous here—it gets slowed down, pitched up, and layered to produce lovely stacked vocal harmonies. Like many of the songs on  , “Vertigo” occupies a sonic space between rough-hewn lo-fi rock and inventively produced soul. “Feeling Myself” combines plucky synths and a pitched-down drumbeat.

As the material summation of a people’s creative life, culture is both an indicator of where a people are and a determinant of where they might go. It is as the great Cape Verdean and Guinea-Bissauan revolutionary Amílcar Cabral once  : “Culture is simultaneously the fruit of a people’s history and a determinant of history.” As the European empires of old overran West and Central Africa, the pillaging of artifacts from ancient indigenous cultures was common. One such culture, the Nok of Nigeria, was known for their beautifully composed terracotta sculptures which currently reside in French and English museums far removed from the people whose ancestors created them. In conceiving the Nok Cultural Ensemble’s debut album  , British-Nigerian drummer   meditated on and studied the Nok artifacts. The result is a collection of songs that are practically vibrating with the rhythmic, melodic, and emotional power of Africa and its diaspora. ’s title track serves as both the album’s opener and a tone-setter. For the intro, the ensemble builds up a cloud of interplaying percussion, drums, whistles and the sprawling sound of a tape delay. After reaching a furious climax, “Njhyi” gives way to the slow, head-bopping rhythm of “Awakening.” The tubist   ( ) guests on “Awakening,” swinging subtly against the beat with breathy melodic lines. “Sang Awun” picks the tempo up significantly as hand drums play deftly alongside a steady, driving groove. Like much of the music throughout  , “Sang Awun” is primarily made up of percussion instruments. Despite this, the composition doesn’t lack in timbral color or in the complexity of its arrangement. As the piece’s rapid-fire snares enter and play off of the hand drums, it is evident that this is in no way limited simply because it is drum-centric. Considering the countless lives, memories and culture lost due to the historical tragedies of colonization and enslavement, there is something healing and invigorating about this music. The rhythms that Wakili-Hick and the Nok Cultural Ensemble have conjured on  are not just music for the sake of music. These sounds are heavy with intention and aligned with the ancient African conception of rhythm as a conduit of information, tradition, history, and culture.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/nok-cultural-ensemble-njyhi-review"}

You might consider that track a precursor to her debut album  ; weaving dramaturgic narrativity into the evolving pulse of techno, Zetina laid the foundation for her theater-inspired debut.

A driving, peak-time affair, the track’s inexorable pulse travels alongside two questions that contrast cis anxiety with trans power: “Have you ever been with a girl like me before?” and “Can you spell my name motherfucker?” She draws further sketches of her ambivalent experiences with intimacy over a minimal broken beat in “Slab of Meat,” chanting with the uncanny cadence of a nursery rhyme: “Are you gonna thaw me out or are you gonna leave me?” “Gemstone,” on the other hand, inhabits a more blissful and affirming emotional register. A reminder of the beauty of each stage of transitioning, “Gemstone” refers to the “metaphor of gemstone months representing different periods of transition,” per the album notes.  s angelic croon reassures that the “Future is near/ Don’t feel alone,” while a steady 4×4 kick keeps things moving.

It’s musically ambitious, splitting the difference between thrash-paced ferocity and soaring melodic guitar work. Beyond this record’s raw power, however, Ripped to Shreds uses these 33 minutes to examine history, identity, and the Chinese diaspora’s relationship with America. Masterminded as ever by Bay Area polymath Andrew Lee, 劇變 takes Ripped to Shreds’ sound beyond its previous parameters. Ripped to Shreds is a more cohesive ensemble now—this is no longer a basement project, but a vehicle for some of Lee’s best ideas to date. Assembled with the help of members of Bay Area acts  ,   and  , 劇變  also sees Lee handle mixing and mastering himself for the first time on a project of this size. As a band, Ripped to Shreds’ main motive is heightened visibility for American-born Chinese people in metal. They accomplish this here both through confronting history’s gnarlier side and through the sheer volume of catchy riffs and emotive solos. There’s an unabashedly political element, sure—”being a minority in America is inherently political,” Lee points out—but 劇變   is, first and foremost, a genuinely fun listen. 劇變  is richly detailed, and “獨孤九劍 日月神教第三節 (In Solitude – Sun Moon Holy Cult Pt 3)” is an especially large serving of controlled chaos. It’s a ten-minute opus-within-an-opus that moves from a sprint into an epic, doomy midsection adorned with epic melodeath guitar passages. As with other tracks on 劇變  , these ear-catching moments draw the listener into a tale rooted in folklore. In the case of “Split Apart by Five Chariots,” the folklore in question is a funny-yet-gruesome Qin Dynasty episode of a well-endowed warrior sneaking into the palace disguised as a eunuch to seduce the Empress Dowager. “I wanted a song where the entire chorus is me yelling about cocks,” Lee says of the track, which concludes with the warrior’s explosive five-chariot end. Not everything is so comical—this is not, after all, . “Reek of Burning Freedom” is packed with roiling riffs and pulls no punches in depicting the American firebombing campaign during the Korean War. Other songs grapple with China’s layered political history. Notably, Lee’s furious howls alternate between English and Mandarin on several tracks. What results is an alternately inspiring and inspired death metal record that confidently creates a space for a growing diversity of musicians and ideas. Lee’s long since proven himself to be capable of marshaling humor and musical depravity in equal measure to a wide variety of ends. 劇變  shows a band capable of doing both at once without eschewing the thick riffs and combustive composition that keep heads banging.", "genre": ["Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ripped-to-shreds-jubian-review"}

It uses the story of a fictional android named King Creole to grapple with art, history, and love—an ambitious and exciting record that hinted at the vast breadth of Richard’s talents. But as far-reaching as   was, it certainly didn’t sound like the work of an artist who was about to veer into neoclassical terrain. But Richard isn’t afraid to defy—or in this case, flat-out shatter—expectations. Teaming up with musician  , Richard’s new full-length  consists of one long composition broken up into 11 movements. The end result plays like a freewheeling, lyric-driven take on the legendary Pharoah Sanders, Floating Points, and London Symphony Orchestra collaboration  Centered on a baroque musical palette drawn from clarinet, saxophone, guitar, and strings,   is unlike anything Richard has done before. But while the orchestral stylings are certainly the biggest change of pace,   most gripping elements come from Richard’s vocals. Her manipulated voice floats atop arrangements that fluctuate along with the dynamics of her intonations. Earthy soundscapes lay the framework for lyrics that grapple with Blackness, heartbreak, and the desire to make change. “I guess I’m not the only one to blame/ But the truth is I really wasn’t sane/ When I met you/ You can’t choose who you give your heart to,” she sings over cavernous, silvery atmospheres on “Cerulean.” “Sandstone” offsets trebly bowed instruments with soaring, reverbed-out belting that calls to mind  ’s Avery Tare. And “Saffron” is the most varied, cinematic cut here, morphing from quiet woodwind washes to a melancholic ballad that evokes a spy movie soundtrack. Interspersing songs built on impassioned verse with instrumental pieces helmed by Zahn,   showcases the R&B stalwart’s well-honed predilection for the avant-garde. The “surprise ambient album” is becoming a familiar trope.

A classically trained violinist who spent years singing Balkan traditional music, she started Mt Fog in 2019 as a “creation of love and a response to the world’s absurdity,” per the description on her Bandcamp page. Recording in her home in Olympia, Washington where she lived without the distraction of an internet connection, Mt Fog’s 2020 EP  and her 2021 debut album   creep along with minimalistic electronic passages and vocals that evoke Kate Bush. On her second full-length  , Mt Fog’s songs feel emboldened and enhanced by so much time spent alone. This time around, Mt Fog’s abilities as a producer have strengthened with arrangements that are noticeably more meticulous and panoramic. On the opener “Behind a Silent Door” locked, programmed drums hammer away beneath jittery swells of keys and Mt Fog’s commanding vocals. Elsewhere, synths wash like gentle waves, moving from left to right channel on “I Am The Sea, You Are The Clouds.” On the similarly nautical-themed “I Am The Lake,” a droning violin creates a tranquil bed for the song’s elemental metaphor for family turmoil: “I am the daughter/ Can I smooth this over /Can I fit into this corner?” she sings before the song’s hook: “I am the lake/ If we’ve got to be bodies of water.” Mt Fog has mastered moments of all-encompassing atmospherics on songs like “Outside Voices,” where plucked violin creates a dizzying effect as the song builds to a gripping and claustrophobic climax.

On her acclaimed 2021 album   the Guatemala-born, Mexico City-based cellist and composer paired her breathy vocals with sweet cello and rich electronics to create radiant compositions. Later that year, she released  , a collaboration with sound artist   consisting of blown-out melodies built from tiny phrases. Where those albums often worked with complementary patterns,   makes intricate music out of striking contrasts. It’s an evolution for Fratti, one that explores the push-and-pull between consonance and dissonance to tell a story of personal transformation. The album derives its dark, raw sound from the instruments that swirl around Fratti’s fervent cello and feathery voice: synth, guitar, and bass from Héctor Tosta; synth and tapes loops from  ; violins from  ; drums from  ; and sax from  . Fratti’s lyrics, which glide above the instruments, speak of the desire to change—to become something that’s still just out of reach. Her music mimics those themes in its search for balance, the way it teeters between moments of chaos and warmth. Most of the tracks build from an oscillating melody or bass line, then branch out by adding new textures on top. The backbone might be as straightforward as the syncopated, deep plucking that runs through “Desde el cielo,” or as invigorating as the bristling cello tones and electronics on “Con Esfuerzo.” While each element ultimately gels, there are moments when the music disintegrates into tense uncertainty—“Cada Músculo,” for example, changes from a buoyant pop track into an apprehensive instrumental. But the song’s layers never come undone, a testament to Fratti’s careful attention to detail. Penultimate track, “Deja de empujar” feels like a culmination of Fratti’s interests in contrast: It’s a finely woven tapestry that hangs by a thread, yet somehow still holds together. Fratti’s voice slips between the arpeggiating saxophone, gliding cello, and retro synth buzzes. Her lyrics are turbulent, too, asking: “¿ ” (“What is my body asking for?/ Stop pushing”). The music is off-balance, but it feels direct, reliably finding its footing amidst the mayhem. By the end of the album, Fratti has found a sense of contentment. There are a few static pulses and a few eerie twinkles on “Siempre tocas algo,” but Fratti’s voice—accompanied by bright cello harmonics and resonant electronics—emerges to take over, charting a course out of turmoil and into the light.

Believe it or not, it’s Earth’s fifth longest land-based mountain chain, lined with everything from rolling hills to leggy swamp gum trees. Having Mother Nature’s best work as a muse helps make Grim Beazley’s electronic music feel warm and fluid rather than cold and robotic—far more indebted to the world’s natural wonders than fantastical dancefloors and stilted machines. In that way, his spring-loaded beats are similar in spirit to Wolfgang Voigt’s work in  , only instead of making his environment sound muffled and slightly sinister, tracks like “Acheron Way” and “Reefer Red Gum” rattle and hum alongside hungry animals, tricked-out trance, and heady ambient-house hooks. ’s title track is also uplifting, casting buoyant chords, snake-like synths, and hissing hi-hats against a spoken word segment about geologic time and man’s complicated relationship with mortality and the things we can and cannot control. “More and more, our technologies give us the illusion that we are exempted from the passage of time,” says its unnamed scientist. “We are constantly distracted by novelty, and fewer of us are intersecting with the physical world through actual labor. We do virtual work that doesn’t really involve any kind of understanding of the laws of physics. And so I think that, too, distances us from the intrinsic reality of time and the fact that many things take time to mature.” While that may sound like a profoundly stoned TED talk, it’s hard to fault Grim Beazley for trying to cram as many concepts and sonic cues into his   debut as possible.

Released on digital download and special edition triple vinyl, the compilation explores how the rise of the synthesizer and a new frontier of musical craft intersected with Argentina’s political and economic metamorphosis following the Falklands War and the fall of Jorge Rafael Videla’s brutal military dictatorship. Ric Piccolo and Ariel Harari, the DJs and producers behind the exhaustively researched compilation, hone in on the theme of transition from the start.   opens with  ‘s “Operativo,” a spectral, almost-industrial cut channeling the paranoid mind state of avant-garde artists creating under a repressive regime’s menacing eye. We then jump to El Signo’s “Dimensiones Ocultas,” emerging from the nightclub’s darkest crevices and onto the dance floor with layered blasts of synthesized bass and crashing percussion reminiscent of an   B-side. In fact, while few of these tracks directly reference external influences—with a notable exception in The Originals’ “Vamos A La Playa,” which reimagines Righeira’s Italo disco classic of the same name—here are unmistakable echoes of electronic pioneers from around the globe. The absurdist synths and “sexy lady” narration of Abaddon’s “No Es Computable” could be easily mistaken for a translated Devo single, while the elegant ambient meditations of Jorge Alfano’s “Fuego” immediately recall Vangelis’ soothing intergalactic journeys. The compilation also showcases popular Argentine stars moonlighting as sonic experimentalists, like actress and comedian Divina Gloria’s Latin-freestyle flavored “Mediterranée Club,” or pop rock icon Fito Paez dropping in on Los Músicos del Centro’s exploratory “Esquirlas.” Historic and geographic significance reverberate through  . Look to Jorge López Ruiz’s “De Mamá Candombe” for a swirling collage of jazz fusion and Afro-diasporic percussive traditions absorbed from Brazil over centuries of cultural osmosis. Meanwhile, cuts like Toby’s “Ain’t That Better” and Delight’s “I Wanna Make You Mine” ground resilient defiance in the hedonistic spirit of disco, directly challenging the dictatorship’s ban on English-language entertainment imposed during the Falklands War. And this is just the tip of the  : the compilation is stacked with 19 visionary deep cuts that invite the listener to consider time, place, and process as part of the listening experience, while others, like Gaita’s kraut-esque “Mueve Tu Cuerpo,” humbly ask that you surrender to dance.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-sintesis-moderna-review"}

The New York City trio’s music is a collision of punk and indie pop, and its basic elements are an insistent rhythm section, catchy deadpan vocal melodies, and guitars playing uncomplicated chord progressions doused in distortion.

Alongside her, drummer Mari Softie and guitarist Jolie M-A crank out a number of slight variations on their sound: taut with clean guitar tone (“Nothing Left”), three-chord rumba (“No Alternative”), droning shoegaze (“Nowhere Fast”), noisy (“Sulfate”), hint of twang (“Dead End Descent”) and so on and so on. “Her Clock Tower” seems to be a surf rock song being played upside down, while “Hearst” somehow sounds like Green Day, The Breeders, and Hole all smashed together and pushed through the lo-fi indie pop aesthetic.

His security-blanket voice is in top form, and the 12-song collection is full of sonic surprises. “Bowevil” is a dark, propulsive epic with a gorgeous arrangement, noir-ish setting “way down in Texas,” and a possible lyrical shout-out to Cohen’s “Everybody Knows.” “Microdose, change your clothes, do what you have to do,” Callahan instructs on “Partition” which, with its raga guitars, percussive mid-song jazz-fusion freak-out, and Ray Manzarek-worthy keyboard solo, could easily have been recorded in 1967. “Naked Souls” is another drawn-out jam, setting Callahan’s trademark mumble to a New Orleans-style arrangement—a loose, and lovely union. And “Natural Information” recalls that idiosyncratic spot during the mid-‘00s where Chicago post-rock and dad rock joined forces, with Jim O’Rourke and Wilco the team captains. “The Horse,” conversely, is classic Callahan—simple yet profound, hitting hard with plain-spoken lines like “What used to be forbidden, is the norm, more and more.” “Planets,” meanwhile, is a nocturnal, mostly instrumental soundscape to get lost inside as things wind down.

In addition to ,  , and     of queerness in schools,   restricting trans students from participating in school sports. Most appallingly,   of these   have intended to allow   in any instances of “dispute” over a student’s sex. The idea of a “genital inspection” stems out of the common notion that a trans person’s genitalia is a public matter (questions about “the surgery” and the reveal of genitalia abound in film and television). It’s within this context that the name and spirit of Pittsburgh-based one-woman experimental black metal project   is worth considering. With her debut EP  , Erin Dawson puts forward a stunning 14 minutes of carefully crafted fury and catharsis as vibrantly hued as it is bloody, a triumphant reversal of the grim history that rests behind its name. The EP’s liner notes acknowledge   Margaret Killjoy and   Hunter Hunt-Hendrix as predecessors within the “emergent tradition of trans, queer, and nonbinary metal musicians.” If there are sonic similarities to either of those forebears, however, it’s only in small moments. Likewise goes for a bevy of other recent bedroom black metal experimentalists like  ,  ,  , and  , for instance, who Dawson manages to stand apart from as much as each does from one another. Altogether, these mutations of black metal show just how varied the once stiflingly codified genre can be and how much expressive potential remains within it to be uncovered. Within this, Dawson’s vocabulary is uniquely her own. The album opens with a snakelike guitar counterpoint over a blast beat. This soon gives way to a slower quarter-note pulse that indulges one of the project’s greatest strengths: Dawson’s exploitation of the lo-fi aesthetics characteristic of raw black metal. Acting as the sole composer, producer, and performer, she utilizes the control available to her, toying with the texture of clipping guitars and cymbals, crafting melody out of the dissonant ambiguous tingle of distorted semitones clashing against one another. Across the EP, Dawson treats her own ideas as a sort of raw material, using both steady crossfades and sudden bursts to bind her disparate thoughts and present new forms and modern myths to our ears. The last vocal line heard on this EP’s opening track “Gnostienne,” for instance, is a bestial roar that steadily dissolves into the soundscape around it. In a few quick seconds it traces a transmogrification: a human becomes a monster then expands until she dissipates into the ether, becoming particles surrounding.

Take 2014, when she hosted  , a cross-country bus tour which documented queer performance artists over a two-month-long journey. This communal spirit remains present in her transformative music productions, both on her 2016 debut EP,  , and, now, her first full-length LP,  Demone, who wrote and recorded   in Los Angeles between 2017 and 2019, states in the album notes that the music is “a call to other trans people, femmes, NB, queers, sex workers, [and] people struggling through capitalism.”  ’s nine songs exude a sense of fearlessness and provide an aural space of both safety and solace in their sweaty communal dance loops and kaleidoscope of gallant, gem-toned melodies.   was written on an ElecTribe ESX-1, and the sampler’s simplistic patterns, with tribalistic four-four beats and crisp snares, play on subtle tensions as the energy multiplies. Most of all, Demone’s vocals, which float and rise over the music, belong next to Klaus Nomi’s new wave operatic octaves or Bronski Beat’s Jimmy Somerville, who proudly vocalized his queerness to the masses in the melancholy hit, “Smalltown Boy.” But there’s little melancholy to be found on  . Instead, there’s comfort in being different—a radiating warmth inside the album’s undulating grooves. The opening song “WAKING” is an unbridled gallop, as percussion swells and synths pour over the song’s edge. The urgency of Demone’s pursuit of strength resonates louder and louder as the album progresses: “Lipstick as armor/ Earrings as shields/ Eyeliner sharper than steel/ As sharp as you feel,” her ghostly voice proclaims over the hyper-build of album standout “NO FL3SH.” With the same dynamism found in nightclub spaces, “WAV3RAV3” snatches a moment of uninhibited freedom from the constraints of the world, its percussive layers recalling the hypnotic trance of Chris & Cosey’s raw electronic escapades as Demone recalls both the tribulations and victories of those that came before her: “Ancestorial knowledge/ The past that follows/ Informs your cells from the start.“ “SPIN3” buzzes with passion, as Demone sings, “In your eyes, it’s a man with a bent mind/ Undefined by the confines of the flesh that holds us.” Though it’s barely detectable through the cascade of synth pads, the song is tinged with heartache—emotions are seen, honored, and celebrated. At its most basic,   feels like it’s derived from nature’s core elements: water’s regenerative power, the cyclic shedding of the skin. Every song delivers a transformational tool for others to follow in Demone’s wake, as she accepts the journey in order to arrive at the destination. “I’d sing to everyone,” Demone writes in the album notes. “Both on, and about to start their transition, all in their own ways.” Demone is a storyteller—a documentarian of sorts—and   is her great work. It is porcelain and fragile—designed for the marginalized people she sings about, from the past, present, and future.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mona-demone-serpent-review"}

Opener “Our Wretched Fantasy” is both euphoric and nostalgic, with Nayar’s signature guitar loops evoking a kind of dream state. “Tetramorph,” which follows, offers a sharp contrast: the song moves from drone-like ambient, punctuated by Nayar’s finger-picking, to a dark, oscillating, sinister whirl of sound. That the track ends as an acoustic Midwestern emo jam is surprising, and welcome. It’s these dualities—fantasy vs. reality, chaos vs. order—that Nayar explores in various ways throughout  . But what comes through most is Nayar’s ability to convey through sound both the excitement of an anonymous night in the city and the melodrama of the 4am comedown.

So it is that musicians in the West can reap the benefits of technology while those in Kinshasa are left to tinker with trash.

At times it feels like all sound is about to fall away, leaving the listener suspended in a state of meditative silence. Miles Davis once  , “Don’t play what’s there, play what’s not there,” and great composers, from the baroque era to classical, jazz, and ambient music, have understood the power of playing with the absence of sound.

In February 2020, while COVID-19 was still a faraway headline in the West rather than a nightmarish actuality, Night Swimmer dropped a queasy, chillwave-tinged   with the message “dedicated to those suffering from the losses of families and those losing lives HOPE STILL REMAINS,” and then fell silent. Those intervening two years of conflict, chaos, isolation, vacillating emotional states, and a search for sanity or serenity of some kind define his long-awaited new album,  . To make it, Dengke retreated from the big city back to his hometown. Throughout, the album plays with such polarities and opposites, from the title (  can translate as “summer” or “idle,”   as “night” or “wilderness”) to the tracks themselves, which whiplash from crisp beats and tactile instrumentation to wholly synthesized realms. In almost any track, you can hear Dengke grapple with the same tumult of emotions that befell us these past few years. “Killing Time” encapsulates such extremes in under four minutes. It comes on as chilled-out and placid, with tones that shimmer like synthesized raindrops, embodying a Fourth World ambient aesthetic. It then quickens into something anxious, hectic, and nervy, like someone trying to focus on deep breathing before lapsing into a doom-scroll on their phone before realizing again that they lost track of their inhale. On the soundtrack-esque “Suspiria,” Dengke toggles between twanging strings and smooth saxophone and smeared electronics, before dropping the track into bleary-eyed, cavernous abstraction. More of that sleek saxophone drives “Night/ Field,” with Dengke this time pairing it to a slick beat for an ‘80s noir-groover. Elsewhere, Dengke recreates the ritualistic percussion of what the notes call “his hometown’s local rituals for the dead.” Through most of the album, Night Swimmer prefers the unsettled, the warped, the temporal, as if to convey that nagging sense that at any moment,   could all crumble away. Just when you think the dancefloor peak “Depressionfruit” will keep ascending, you’re plunged back into a twilit realm until the final minute.

The male moth then delivers a “spermatophore” (a small sack containing spermatozoa and nutrients for the larvae-to-be) to the female via his aedeagus.

Frequently, transitions from track to track seem to provide subtle jokes, and the whole album is paced with moderate peaks and valleys, allowing the ears (and vibe) to recover from its more abrasive offerings. And while the album shares very little with  , it seems likely it was at least in part structured after a triptych (like itself) that its name references: Hieronymus Bosch’s  . The duo’s sixth release for Hausu Mountain,   serves as a celebration, marking the label’s ten years of existence and, likewise, Moth Cock’s  .

For a more direct introduction to the duo, one might consider their bitesize   or their more polished 2019 release  .

The emotional catalyst for his latest album   was formulated during the time Livingston spent during the pandemic reading through more than seventy books of letters written to and from himself throughout his youth. The result is a set of songs that are deeply personal reflections on life, healing, and self-actualization. The album’s opener “Drummer” is a slick and funky, mid-tempo tune with a nimble bassline and a gorgeous bridge. Lyrically, Livingston calls back to James Brown’s famed proclamation that we “ ,” submitting the drive of the music to its foundational element: the rhythm. From here, Livingston expands into a plea for his own emotional well-being, “You been giving me something, but I’ma need a little air/ You giving me nothing but I’ma get it somewhere I swear.” With its dreamy synths, finger snaps, and Livingston’s sweet, vulnerable vocal, “6AM” conjures an emotional space not unlike the bittersweet romanticism of  / -era Prince. The title track “Like Neptune” has a head-nodding beat and lyrics that explore sadness and impermanence. Livingston’s guitar playing is deft and subtle in this glowing, 21st-century blues. “Bend Yr Ear” is a slow, soulful cut in which Livingston makes a simple and effective proclamation of his love for his partner. “Bend Yr Ear”s musical backing is dark and understated as he walks listeners through the ecstatic heights and excruciating lows of love. “You make me laugh, you make me cry/ Your love is like the sunshine washing me clean/ Oh my my my/ If the flood comes/ Let it rain,” he says. While Livingston takes a serious, deeply expressive approach to the album’s themes and performances,   is not a dour listen. The production has some heavy that belie Livingston’s hip-hop roots while the lyrics remind listeners that the real strength to make it through life’s trials is the strength that we pull from intimacy and vulnerability.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/son-little-like-neptune-review"}

Now aged between 12 and 18, Sandrine, Grace, Julienne, Anne, Angélique, Urrice, and Marguerite have gone from never having played music to releasing two albums and playing some of Europe’s biggest festivals, all in the space of six years. Their story starts in Natitingou, a town in Northern Benin, when Andrè Balaguemon, a local musician and social worker, decided to form a girls’ band to tackle some of the issues he observed in his community, from forced marriage to a disparity in education and meaningful employment opportunities for women. In that region of Benin, where music—especially when delivered with the girls’ spunky, rock ’n’ roll verve—is usually reserved to men, establishing Star Feminine Band was in itself an act of defiance. After responding to a call on local radio, the aspiring musicians (some of whom had never held an instrument before) began an intense program of musical training—all while remaining in school, since making sure they completed their formal education was an important part of the project. Considering the idea behind their genesis then, it’s no surprise that many of their songs deal with themes of justice, equality, and empowerment: On  , the girls sang in Waama about the importance of girls’ education on the whirling, psychedelia-tinged “ ,” while the Peul-language lyrics of “ ” celebrate women and encourage them to succeed.

Julienne Sayi’s slick basslines and Marguerite Kpetekoute’s pounding drums provide a solid springboard for Anne Sayi’s guitar, which in the last third of the song, breaks into a distinctly Congolese  (the extended solos or instrumental bridges typical of Congolese rumba, that get people up and dancing). On “L’excision” the band protest female genital mutilation over rattling, clanging rhythms, turning up the energy with their ululations and call-and-response vocals, while on the scorching “Le droit de l’enfant” they demand that children’s rights always be respected. also sees the girls singing in English, adding the French, Waama, Ditamari (two languages from the North), Bariba, and Fon (two of Benin’s main languages), such as on opener “We Are Star Feminine Band”, which erupts with a barrage of drums, xylophone, and percussion polyrhythms, or the more subdued, melodic “Woman Stand Up.” Given their age and story, it would be easy for a band like Star Feminine Band to risk slipping into gimmick territory, but their musical abilities, youthful energy, and impassioned delivery keep them far from it. Whether it’s their musicianship, the urgency of their messages, or their meteoric rise, it’s clear that Star Feminine Band are a force to be reckoned with.", "genre": ["World"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/star-feminine-band-in-paris-review"}

Listening to the project from start to finish feels like watching the seasons change from summer to autumn. Lead singles “Permeated Secrets” and “Onus” showcase his intent as an artist: Telling the unvarnished truth over synth-heavy beats. “Onus” is built on the idea that “what you resist persists,” Sey employing the double-time delivery common to UK club and hip-hop over a stripped-back beat. “Permeated Secrets” is knit together by a retro synth tone, and Sey’s voice is mixed so that it floats right above the beat as it sings of the persistence of truth. Seemingly contradictory thoughts of moving forward and questioning the future appear in “Night Ride,” with Sey’s lyrics in service of the quintessentially dubstep 145 bpm rhythm.

The dying field is the relationship, and the expert is frontwoman Elizabeth Stokes as she dissects love lost to herself and others across 45 minutes of spirited power-pop.  is effervescent almost in spite of itself and chock-full of unblinking vulnerability. The Beths have a knack for barreling through choruses before letting the guitars breathe only for a moment, which is arguably an emotional structure as much as it is a musical one. But elsewhere, the foursome ease off the gas altogether, and it works on songs like “Your Side” with its last-scene-of-a-peak-2000s-rom-com sparkle both melodically and lyrically. Stokes is a smart enough lyricist to know when point-blank declarations will do: “Don’t cry/ I’m on the next flight/ To be by your side.” You can almost picture her running through the airport. Despite its lively drumming and tireless riffs (especially on “Head In The Clouds,” which has a little bit of Billy Idol’s “Dancing With Myself” to it), the album has something wobbly at its core. Breakups are destabilizing. They undo us in every direction, which Stokes is keen to explore. Self-doubt prevails on “Change in the Weather,” when Stokes asks, “Is this an illusion?/ Are the stars in the ceiling?/ Am I in delusion?” She spirals into derision on “Best Left,” spitting “Some things are best left to rot,” softened ever so slightly by her bandmates’ stacked harmonies. “I Told You That I Was Afraid” is racked by the anxiety “that everyone around holds me in some secret disdain.” But  doesn’t end there. It ends gently on “2am,” which isn’t about how it made you feel after the fact. It’s about how it felt then—“Do you feel it?/ Feel it like you did back then?”—and about how it felt then is how it still feels: “Though it hurts/ I still love you the same.” Stokes knows that’s how these things go.

The Philadelphia-based band, led by guitarist Arthur Rizk and fronted by enigmatic crooner Phil Swanson, took a classier tack than most of their contemporaries. Their melodically sophisticated brand of heaviness was more sport coat than denim vest. Rizk and co-guitarist John Powers traded crystalline riffs and perfectly placed solos like Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, the dapper duo whose refined playing powered Queensrÿche’s brilliant early albums. Swanson’s stentorian presence locked everything into place. He seldom reached for big, belting notes – the climax of   being a stunning exception — but his tightly controlled delivery held seemingly limitless power. Then, at the beginning of 2019, he quit the band. The remaining members – Rizk, Powers, drummer Justin DeTore, and bassist Brad Raub – took a brief pause to consider their next move, but in truth, there was only one person they believed could replace Swanson. Veteran singer Brendan Radigan ( ,  ) came into the fold about six months after Swanson’s departure, and by the end of 2019, he was demoing the songs that would become  . His addition came with the former frontman’s full blessing; in a recent (print-only)   interview, Rizk says Swanson sees Radigan as the Bruce Dickinson to his Paul Di’Anno.

The songs on  owe as much to the late ’70s AOR of bands like Foreigner and Boston as they do to traditional heavy metal. Everything Sumerlands does on the album is in service of the hooks, which are abundant. For his part, Radigan rises to meet them; his voice is more pliable than Swanson’s, and he’s able to chase melodies through ascending patterns and around tight corners. There’s an emotional urgency to the way he sings the pleading “Heavens Above” and the sly power ballad “The Savior’s Lie” that elevates the material. also sounds  , and delightfully so. In Rizk’s day job as an audio engineer and producer, he’s become one of metal’s premier studio wizards, and he plies his sacred art throughout  . He delights in small details, like the feather-light synths that trace the title track’s chugging main riff and the dueling solos that disappear into the haze of a deeply ’80s fade-out on “Death to Mercy.” Had they been blessed with the right timing and record deal, Sumerlands might have run up a six-figure studio tab back when Journey and Toto were tearing up the album charts.

The longer it persists, the stronger, more influential, and more original the music becomes. This is doubly so when a musical narrative starts out already imbued with community intentions then picks up each ensuing generation’s ideas on the subject, embedding that continuity with new hopes and dreams; warnings and examples; sounds and forms. This is how traditions are born, and few contemporary cultural traditions match the power of Great Black Music. Artists with the vision to recognize its full breadth (rather than simply serving it piecemeal via genre categorization) work on an immense canvas; and as time continues to collapse, musicians presenting the breadth of that tradition are addressing nothing less than the full bore of history. This is the context of JoVia Armstrong’s  , the drummer-educator-technologist’s second album under her own name, and a rich document of this diasporic musical continuum from a contemporary perspective. Featuring music written and produced by Armstrong, performed with violinist Leslie DeShazor plus a few community guests, and originally commissioned to accompany the traveling group art show  ,   is an expansive, mostly instrumental work, a soundtrack to the moment when old delineations stop making sense, and intersectionality is less code than new reality—when, as Jason McDaniel’s liner notes say, “the collective consciousness of Black Music is more fluid…than ever before.” Armstrong is well-versed to tackle the moment, as she’s long subscribed to this fluidity. The multi-instrumentalist grew up in Detroit, mentored by the drummer   (whose own roots in the tradition stretch from   to  ), and has been operating in Motor City and Chicago’s diverse musical spaces for nearly 20 years. Her vocals and rhythms have accompanied a host of different musicians: she appears on recordings by, among others, AACM composer Nicole Mitchell ( ) and house don   (who adapted and remixed Armstrong’s song, “Gullah Geechee”); she’s a member of JC Brooks’s retro-soul-punk band   and the all-female, strings and drums quartet,  ; she has been an in-demand touring drummer, and operated a community music school on the South Side. For Armstrong, fluidity is the fuel. And the power of   is how naturally all the parts flow together. With Mitchell’s flute,  ’s guitar, Isaiah Sharkey’s bass, and Amr Fahmy’s Rhodes augmenting DeShazor’s amplified strings, Armstrong’s stripped-down kit, and tactfully added electronic post-production, the textures hint at some near-future sound of global jazz. (The gorgeous Mitchell- and Armstrong-led “Meditations on Oya,” in fact, echoes  ’s similarly minded “Stretch Music.”) But this   is less about solo playing than how the compositions invite each musician to interact with the material and the tradition, creating music that sounds yearning, multivalent, and futuristic. Imitating its title, “Breathe” rises and falls on waves of Parker’s distortions, DeShazor’s violin, and Armstrong’s cymbals, creating a cascading science fiction desert sound. “Shades and Shapes” rises as a guitar/keys/hi-hat funk configuration, before mutating into a kind of Middle Eastern dance tune that showcases DeShazor, then disappearing into the near-ambient space-age electronics of Fahmy’s Rhodes. Best of all is the radical interplay on the  ’s one vocal track: At its start, “Zebra” places the great Chicago singer Yaw Agyeman in front of an incomparable production that has the feeling of D’Angelo’s   but as a lo-fi dub experience, before introducing Teh’Ray Hale’s rap, delivered over laid-back rimshots and glitchy, virus-like blasts. For the rest of the track, the music and the voices keep transforming—the second half is essentially a dub remix of the first—as though the mixing board’s ghosts are getting involved in the storytelling. The elements they add are already part of this tradition (see: Lee Perry, CX KiDTRONiK), but what JoVia Armstrong’s   does is put them on an equal sonic footing with all the others—continuing what came before, making sure it has another place to go.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/jovia-armstrong-eunoia-society-the-antidote-suite-review-2"}

What happens here has precedents in the duo’s memory banks (  an epic 20-minute artifact from 1996, is melodically echoed in the   opener, “A Ghost at Noon”) as well as in recent additions (  a lovely, unwinding modular-synth piece for Longform Editions, whose quilt of patches can be heard throughout the album). Yet at four tracks that span over 50 minutes, the album’s focused, distinctive layers of drum-machine giddiness, sunburst melodicism, and mixing-board acrobatics are unlike anything either one has ever devoted this much time or space to. Whether it was inspired by Kraftwerk or Bitchin Bajas or a middle-aged desire to touch the canon of abstract dance music, it’s a pleasure to get lost in these pulses. They take all sorts of shapes: Some cascade as programmed keyboard textures, buoyed by keyboard melodies; others spring out of the kick drum, whose metronomic noise lays the groundwork even as the drum programming splinters it into a dubbed-out, polyrhythmic fantasia.

Vaulting off the pristine psych-pop of their previous LP  , the Chicago quintet obliterate precedent by fearlessly reimagining their sound with vibrant strokes of reggaetón, hyperpop, and house. The laid-back vibes remain a hallmark, but here the music drips with self-assured, unapologetic swagger encompassing greater themes of curiosity and liberation. Every note in   feels like a cathartic release; from its genre-crushing beat shifts and rumbling basslines geared towards dance floor abandon, to the title track’s (“LSE”) meditative ambience. On shimmering rock zinger “Nos Soltamos,” the band lets go of expectations—self-imposed and external—amidst jubilant blasts of synthesized horns that recall Bowie’s “Modern Love.” “ ” (“Youth, raised in wakes, religion, middle class”) sings Javier Forero on album closer “I Am Nobody,” listing off details from an imperfect upbringing that included struggles with depression and a womanizing father. Confessions pour out, as Medina is racing to find inner peace before the song mutates from ’70s soft-rock into K-hole-inducing house. In fact, dance music is a major reference point for the group’s dynamic new chapter. The album’s strongest moments with daringly and wholeheartedly embrace of reggaetón. Inspired by   punkish, queer grit, the back-to-back run of “Tu Tonto,” “XO,” and “Toy Premiado” melds groovy funk, beachy vaporwave, and nasty dembow riddims into an ass-shaking molotov. The bars are braggadocious, and the band feels empowered by their own sexiness, using the unrelenting barrage of sound to unpack their own past traumas with religion, most notably in the video for “XO.” Divino Niño’s bassist and rapper Javier Forero highlights graffiti as a major inspiration for the way the album sounds. “We basically took the songs we were writing and vandalized them,” he explained ahead of the album. “We might keep the core of the idea but we wanted to rip apart our own work.” This sort of tagging technique can be found throughout  , like on “Especial,” which infuses cruising psych with jolts of hedonistic disco. On “Miami,” nostalgic new jack swing snowballs into Bad Bunny-flavored Latin trap, with more than a few winks to Will Smith’s late ’90s classic of the same name. For “Drive,” the album’s lead single, the band trades genre flipping for extrapolation, dialing up the BPMs in a rapturous wind-in-your-hair crescendo. Divino Niño are no strangers to bilingual songwriting, though   is undoubtedly their most Spanish-anchored record to date. Medina and Forero dip lightly into English, choosing instead to lean on their Colombian heritage and sneak in childhood Easter Eggs with multiple references to   and  . It’s a sweet, dazzling tour through the life of a band and each of its members, stepping outside themselves to glean fresh lessons from the journey. “ ” (“The things that happened happened/ There’s nothing a few beers can’t heal”), further accepts Medina on “I Am Nobody.” And he’s right.

Ahead of the five-minute mark, the band intentionally dampens the energy and fire that it ignited earlier in the track, allowing for Stewart to step to the forefront with a measured, thoughtful bassline that anchors the remainder of the piece.

However solid the foundation, clashes of ego and secret solo aspirations have a way of creeping in and hobbling the collective output. For Philly’s  , the sense of collectivism is strong, as are the respective members’s solo careers, but outside forces kept a full-crew album on the backburner when an unexpected illness nearly cut  ’s life short. He recovered, and the group—Castro,  ,  , and producer  r—joined forces to release  , their official debut, earlier this month. While   fulfills expectations, pairing hard-hitting production with acerbic wordplay, it also offers departures like “No Threat” that push past rap norms. Here, Curly Castro and Zilla Rocca meditate on the nature of violence over earthy drums and ghostly backing vocals. “All those years of sparring/ Learning how to use knives/ You learn discipline and mercy,” Zilla concludes, “violence never served me.” The arrival of Small Pro’s “Sedale Lo Pro Interlude” marks a shift toward a more exploratory and conceptual second half. On “Supreme Rock,” Castro chants about “signs pointing to them aliens on rooftops” as the tension builds for a beat drop, while PremRock’s verse details a holiday marked by train strikes in Paris and complaints about metal plates slowing his voyage through TSA. Wrecking Crew are out to advance the form, favoring interplay over competition, but they’re also not above the typical posse cut posturing. They just flip it to serve their own ends: The recurring “left hand, right hand” motif that kicks off every MC’s verse in “Odom” serves to unify the track, rather than feeling like a contest to see who can deliver the most lethal 16 bars. And, sure, much of   can be summed up in the   that declared “Dudes can literally just sit around naming old sports players and just have the best time,” but the group’s name-checking of motley NBA players like Steve “Crooked Leg” Colter, Harold Miner, Mateen Cleaves, and the O’Bannon brothers, isn’t just for bravado’s sake. The hook on “Sixx Fo” establishes a mold for the list of players Castro names—they all measure in at 6’4”. Then there’s the album title, a clever pun on 1990s Laker Sedale Threatt, who stepped in to fill Magic Johnson’s shoes after the Hall of Famer tested positive for HIV in 1991. Though Threatt never won a ring with the Lakers, he played five seasons and earned the nickname “The Thief” for his ability to collect steals. He remained on the mind of Curly Castro, who’s   by players who have to step up after a superstar steps out. That Castro chose this for the album’s title suggests that Wrecking Crew is filling the void left by legacy crews come and gone.   is the sound of them stepping out of the shadows.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/wrecking-crew-sedale-threat-review"}

Destabilizing the gender and genre propositions of the emerging “ ” Mogzawa and Holon’s unexpected foray onto the dancefloor isn’t as unlikely as it might seem. Both are longtime fans of techno, having bonded over a mutual affinity for ‘90s techno giants like   and  . Mogzawa’s talent for constructing hypnotic rhythms might’ve been forecasted in her drumming on Warpaint’s   while Holon’s electropop   with Neon Neon certainly reside in the same sonic neighborhood that they explore here as Belief. Nevertheless, the confines of genre remain potent limiters on the imagination; no matter how much of a trope “genre-bending” has become during this Internet-fueled age of musical bricolage, switchups of this sort still register as a pleasant surprise, especially when executed as well as they are on this debut. “What would Mark Bell do?” This mantra guided the development of Belief’s debut record, and it shows. The sibilant bleeps and murky acid basslines that were a staple for LFO find themselves reincarnated via Mogzawa and Hollon’s productions. The record begins with “I Want To Be,” an anthemic track whose frenetic kicks and breakbeats create an energy that belies its BPM at 128. Armed with a  , an infectious synth progression, and an aspirational mantra, they build an atmosphere appropriate for the ambrosial hours of peak-time raving. While they certainly can make music that’s spiritually uplifting, the duo also have a knack for tapping into the visceral. “WOT” perhaps embodies this best: its four-on-the-floor kicks plod rather than bounce, its synths pierce as the hi-hats hiss, making for a murky track that grounds as much as others like “Jung” and “Art of Love” float. “Nebo” sees both tendencies come to the fore, with acidic 303s creating a foundation that melts into air, dissolved by trance synths and a healthy helping of reverb. Dance music purists need not be distrustful of this offering by apparent outsiders; Belief knows what they are doing, and they do it well. If the first 10 tracks weren’t enough, Mogzawa and Holon save their most intriguing work for last. The emotional, beatless “Charch” might fit in well alongside the cybernetic post-club of a   compilation. It’s a nice postscript, a cliffhanger that leaves us wanting more.

In between the glib quips (“It’s your turn to get ripped off, so get inspired”) is a poignant thesis. “I could have danced all night/ And done a thousand things/ But without begging,” Gaudet intones on “The Masked Singer,” before the instrumental coda trails off into the night. Despite taking a generally pessimistic outlook towards their own career prospects, Kiwi Jr. are making moves to transcend the jangle box and their local scene. Perhaps the finest song on the album is “Clerical Sleep,” an addictive soft rock gem in the mold of Canadian indie luminaries  —the masters of the depression vs. contentment dichotomy, and whose frontman is credited in the liner notes—“It felt so good to be home/ But leaving feels even better.” Kiwi Jr. mark two is worthy of trust—and judging by this album, they feel the same.", "genre": ["Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kiwi-jr-chopper-review-2"}

Nelson tends to sing softly, and her breathy alto lends itself particularly well to expressions of cool resignation or gamely accepted defeat.

Electric Soul & Brass from Sudan’s Red Sea Coast", "artist": "Noori & His Dorpa Band", "description": "Noori was 18 when he crafted the tambo-guitar, a hybrid instrument that combined a   (a stringed lyre also known as the  ) with an electric guitar he found in a junkyard. With it, he envisioned keeping Beja music alive, something that was difficult in his home country of Sudan when the former Head of State, Omar al-Bashir, made   to erase the Beja peoples’s culture and deny them their rights. Since the 1989 military coup that led to his rise in power, the government has closed down the nation’s music halls, forbade the creation and consumption of music, with the exception of songs that explicitly glorified Islam or war; and facilitated the imprisonment, torture, and murder of artists. Fearing for their safety, many Sudanese musicians fled the country altogether, prompting a nationwide decline in popular music that’s persisted to this day. Sudanese music has always been intertwined with politics and social change, and  follows that lineage. While it’s an entirely instrumental record, Noori believes that bringing this music out into the world can “form the most potent act of resistance,” moving in lockstep with Beja activists’s ongoing cries for justice. “Al Amal,” which translates to “Hope,” brings some clarity to this idea. Its percussion and rhythm guitar provide a sturdy foundation for the tambo-guitar and tenor sax to intertwine elegantly. At times they mirror each other’s sinuous melodies, and just as striking are the flashier solos. Their music soars in both an encouraging and focused manner, and one can credit that to their collaborative groupthink as much as their individual strengths. One of the most stirring aspects of Noori & His Dorpa Band’s music is that they’re in dialogue with Sudanese music from decades past.   recalls artists like   or Abdel Gadir Salim in how, with their blending of Western and African musical styles, craft a sound all their own. One of the album’s highlights, “Jabana,” is a smoky blues endeavor but is more meditative than a typical desert blues track; It’s reminiscent of   if it weren’t for the lilting sax and winding melodies granting it a more enchanting aura. Elsewhere there’s “Daleb,” spearheaded by a hypnotic, pulsing guitar rhythm that’s simultaneously jagged and cozy; and “Saagama,” whose arid guitar melodies and ambling tabla rhythms capture the spirit of traversing the Nubian. These longform, mesmerizing treks keep you locked in from beginning to end, and it echoes what Noori & His Dorpa Band represent: a firm commitment to upholding their people’s culture, and pushing back against all opposition.", "genre": ["World"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/noori-and-his-dorpa-band-beja-power-review"}

The comparison isn’t drawn just because of their youth: these musicians are more knowledgeable, thoughtful, and skilled than is common even for adult players. The throughline is the unique energy of young genius at its earliest work—people of a certain age still talk about Squirrel Bait being the best live band they’ve ever seen or mixed, despite the fact that most of its members have continued to work in highly respected projects as adults. It should come as no surprise that this band is so musically skilled: bassist Asher Case, drummer Isaac Lowenstein, and guitarist Kai Slater have all been playing music since elementary school and come from musical families.

The litany of names they list as influences— ,  , Talk Talk,  —indicates they could easily dominate a punk and art rock trivia game set up by people twice or even thrice their age.

The band tried out new, unfinished material in their live performances, so by the time they went into the studio, the parts were so familiar that the band had an easy time putting them together into songs that felt purposeful—perhaps the crowd can help you compose, too. Their first tape (and only full length) was crafted during the pandemic lockdown during which they could not play or attend live shows—an isolated rut they audibly blast out of in the opening of “New Age (I’ve got a).” Lifeguard’s new age is one in which they harness and reproduce in the studio the energy of their live performances, and it finds them more emotionally close as a unit than they’ve been on previous releases. Lead single “I know I know” is where Lifeguard really take off, making absolutely clear how much more focused and catchy their songwriting has become through live interaction; there is more collaboration amongst members and lyrics have become less of an afterthought, with Case and Slater both bringing copious ideas to practices in their respective notes apps.

While the music directly bears the traces of its time—Moore’s multi-tracked vocal choruses and rounded, subtly tape-echoed snares recall the shapeshifting Cale/Eno brand of pop—there is a distinct economy of form and gesture in Moore’s work, a simplicity that becomes complex through repetition and reiteration. Whereas     the prog form, splaying and scattering its bones only to reconstruct them into something qualitatively different and truly complex, Moore takes an intensive approach, unfolding inherent tensions in the prevailing pop forms by recreating them. Through this act of replication, Moore sharpens certain functional components of the pop song: his call-and-response guitar riffs have an unusually serrated edge; his fired-up keyboard noodling has the jarring, alien sound of klaxons. And in between the tinny funk and dub-inflected grooves there arise moments of beauty—see the shimmering breakdown halfway through hit single “Judy Get Down”—as well as a gripping theatricality (“Useless Moments”). The end result of this juxtaposition of popular styles and tropes—all grounded in a driving, mid-tempo drumbeat—is that the structure of the pop song is surfaced and made apparent in all its artifice, just as Ornette’s   music never exceeded a certain static, middling tempo so as to emphasize the rhythmic and tonal content of the music with the utmost clarity. At the same time, the careening joy of the best pop music is wholly preserved—the back-to-back paeans “Lucia” and “Caught Being In Love” are both built atop the ubiquitous “Be My Baby” drum pattern—but the fact that they are by no means wholly “original” only strengthens their effect: the seemingly mystical beauty of pop is that it continues to move us to tears even when its basic formula and inherent derivativeness is made painfully obvious. Slapp Happy took this refractive approach to the gentler sounds of soft rock and cabaret, giving an edge to the seemingly edge-less. Moore takes the already seemingly edgy sound of late-’70s punk, glam, and art pop and teases out its beating heart, in the process creating a music that breaks from its template while still orbiting it. If the music sounds very “of its time,” that is exactly the point: unexpected beauty, pleasure, and delight follow from what only seems like more of the same.", "genre": ["Experimental", "experimental rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/anthony-moore-flying-doesnt-help-review"}

Label runner Luis Alvarado has worked indefatigably to excavate and release a wealth of experimental music in danger of being lost to time—a project which grew organically out of his ongoing commitment to contemporary scenes in Lima and beyond. The Peru-focused   collection is a robust example of Buh’s archival mission: ranging from the work of electroacoustic pioneers in the ’60s and ’70s to the gritty punk and noise of ’80s and ’90s underground movements, the scope of the series shows that Buh isn’t just filling holes in the history of Peruvian experimental music, but is actively participating in the creation of such a history. Síntomas de techno, the latest Sounds Essentials volume, covers a period of transition between Peru’s   (underground rock) of the mid-’80s and the various local electronic music scenes that consolidated during the ’90s. The shadow of rock and punk looms large over this compilation, just as it did over many synth-pop and industrial groups in Europe at the time; in the Peru scene’s early days, the post-punk kids and the synth tinkerers all played the same shows. “La Gran Masa” is a hardcore scorcher arranged for synthesizer and drum machine—it even has breakdowns with rapid drum fills that pop off, despite technical limitation. The motorik beat, stilted guitar, and sustained synths that open “A dónde” place it firmly in post-punk territory, but the song’s bridge has an infectious bounce that foregrounds the rudimentary electronics at play. Notably, both tracks are by projects of ex-members of Narcosis, a seminal rock   band. Of course, the growth of “techno-pop” in Peru was as much a matter of new music as of new technology. People danced to new wave, post-punk, and EBM in Lima’s alternative clubs; they traded tapes with others from around the world, and fanzines covered acts like Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, The Human League, and D.A.F. “Martillo,” the opening track on  , stands out as an industrial tour de force, grafting found metal percussion à la Einstürzende Neubauten onto a relentless mechanical rhythm as dictated by a Casiotone. It’s also easy to hear Nitzer Ebb and Front 242 in “No Nunca,” with its terse, shouted vocals and a groove grounded by an overdriven bassline, but the simple drum pattern manages to keep it punk. Only on the last few songs, with their sequenced synths and wider range of electronic timbres, do we get a glimpse of the dancefloor to come: “Y de aquí no me voy” is a bona fide synth-pop gem with delightful counterpoint between pulsing streams of sixteenth notes and a succession of synth lines, generating effortless forward movement, and the tempo and four-on-the-floor kick of “Primera secuencia” make it the most suggestive of techno proper out of all the tracks here.

Just look at the near pitch-black of the cover of EMÆNUEL’s third release   (either as the cassette J-card or as a .jpg) and try to decipher the gray shape in the lower corner. Is it an x-ray of an egg? Is it from a brain MRI scan? Might it be EMÆNUEL’s own skull? While the album was said to have been written years before, when EMÆNUEL was living/visiting/traveling through the tumultuous Indian city of Kolkata, “an experiment in rapid exploration,” that exotic location belies the profound sense of interiority of the music itself. The Nigerian artist might be mysterious, but we find ourselves deeply immersed in his soundworld, which has a few similarities to the likes of Demdike Stare,  , or   (with a touch of the clamor of the artists on the   roster), but it’s hard to imagine that any sound originates from the outside world, as everything seems to arise from some dark, turbid place. Listen to “Rivers of Blood” on headphones and you might conflate its echoing pings, metallic clangs, and watery drips with other noises, so neatly does it dissolve amid the exterior noises of a subterranean subway ride, or in the lightless ambiance of an echoing cave. EMÆNUEL is adept at making every sound feel temporal, intangible. So even amid the heavy throb and percussion of “Bhadralok,” bass-heavy fuzz-blasts keep knocking the rhythmic clatter off-center, unsettled. “Cold” also cloaks itself in shoegaze-heavy distortion, as if channeled through thoroughly blasted earbuds. “Dust” lives up to its title, the droney ambiance at the beginning of the piece melting away to reveal even more desolate space, It’s here that the darkness of the first half of the album begins to let in a little glint of light, as mesmerizing shimmer and the sounds of running water overtake the piece. “Ambrosia” begins with a dense din, only to widen as a deep bass tone sounds and higher, bell-like chimes start to resonate.  , as the accompanying text explains, “is dedicated to a friend who restored faith in the artist.” Moving from a despairing to hopeful outlook, that sense of dichotomy informs the entire album.

His thoughtfulness and political insight as a lyricist have always been evident in his work, but ELUCID’s music never falls prey to the revivalist nostalgia for ‘90s boom-bap that has so often dominated hip-hop counterculture on the East Coast. Both in his solo work and his work alongside   in  , ELUCID is a complex—and at times almost combative—lyricist, with slow and exacting bars that unfurl over layers of unpredictable samples steeped in reverb. On his latest album  , the deep resonance and measured pace of ELUCID’s delivery gives him a sense of authority; like a blunted jeremiad, his words are primed for maximum impact and purpose. While the delivery is honed, ELUCID’s beat selections are frequently woozy and screwed, his voice a grounding column set atop an eroding foundation. His words are intentional, but never sound scripted or rehearsed, despite the emphatic punctuation of almost every syllable. His songwriting resists conventional verse-chorus structure, and when he does approach something resembling a hook, like the repeated utterance of “Just got to heaven and I can’t sit down” on opening track “Spelling,” it feels more like a chant or a mantra. He’s backed by something like a scattered jam session on “Smile Lines,” which reflects the way ELUCID often employs his voice like an instrument to be jammed out—a tool for open-ended expression rather than tight structure. Production work from producers like ,  , and indie-pop duo   strips the varnish from samples, refurbishing familiar sounds into something otherworldly. The album’s palette often draws from jazz and soul, like the muted horns on “Impasse,” but it’s been mutated, like the almost future-funk bassline sample on “Betamax,” which stutters and jerks instead of grooves. Like the media format that song’s title alludes to,  frequently feels like a cassette that’s been taped over, or a public access feed scrambled by snow. At times, like the outro of “Ghoulie,” the instrumentation around ELUCID dissolves into pure ambient static, his production slouching more toward avant-garde composition than lo-fi hip-hop. But there’s still a heady beat to cuts like “Bunny Chow,” which almost resembles classic Houston rap. A native of Jamaica, Queens, ELUCID’s hometown turns up in song titles like “Nostrand” and “Guy R. Brewer,” but his work is shaped by the city on a more elemental level as well: the title   is a tribute to his late grandmother, with whom he lived for a period of time in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood. ELUCID’s musique concrète wears the singular dissonance of New York City on its sleeve, a place where fond childhood memories are surrounded by grating metal and the surveillance of the police state, as an unending soundtrack of transit and construction and motion crossfade together.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/elucid-i-told-bessie-review"}

Ovid’s Thisbe falls on the sword belonging to her lover Pyramus, the same one he used to stab himself upon believing she had been killed by a beast. After Tarquin rapes her, the devoted Lucretia compels the men of Rome to vengeance and revolution, then plunges a dagger into her heart. Juliet resorts to the same method upon awakening in the tomb to discover Romeo dead and his poison drained. They do not hesitate to die for love or honor. The image of this woman in the decisive moment—or, in the moment just prior to the decisive moment—reappears       and, in its way, through  . Noble puts it best on “Lifeforce”: “The only thing I ever got from the stars was how to shine while dying.” A kind blade, as Noble and these women before her know, is ultimately one that puts you out of your misery. When she sings, “This is how it feels when you can’t let go” on “My Angel,” she’s talking about pain. A kind blade, for all its violence, takes the pain away, and it dangles over the album’s 53 minutes and magnetic, decidedly drum-and-bass darkness. Even Noble’s most featherlight flute trills can’t fully counterbalance her proggy, trip-hop breakbeats. This leap to the mythical is not a huge one, seeing how Noble has thought of herself in fantastical terms since her 2020 debut  . She wears wings and   and, occasionally, the kind of   you find on the cover of pulp paperbacks illustrated by Frank Frazetta or Ken Kelly.

There’s also album highlight “The Dragon’s Rose,” which matches its dramatic title with some impressive vocal acrobatics and arguably Noble’s finest flute performance on the record. With shambolic beats that deliberately skirt dropping into a satisfactory groove,   is not exactly for everyone—something Noble herself has  . (The same could be said of many of the other releases from L.A.-based underground label  .) Even so, Noble gives the listener the occasional foothold, namely the straightforward techno of “I Miss Dancing” and the gentle guitar-led ballad “Sailor.” But those are the exceptions, not the rule.   production is weighty and Noble’s take on drum & bass is more suited to spellcasting than dancing.

Her first and only album, 1970’s  , made her the first Black woman to find success in country music. Martell spent a chunk of the ‘60s singing R&B in a family band, but in 1969, a manager emboldened by the rise of Charley Pride approached her about following in the footsteps of country’s first African American singing star. Signing to bigshot Nashville producer Shelby Singleton’s label, Martell and a roomful of Music City sharpshooters cut   in just one day. Its rather on-the-nose title notwithstanding, the album introduces Martell as a straight-ahead country singer rather than trying to milk any kind of gimmicky country-soul hybrid approach. Even though the almost-title track, “Color Him Father,” had recently been a pop hit for R&B band The Winstons, Martell completely transformed (and arguably improved) the tune, turning it into a gently galloping country heart-tugger and snagging one of the album’s two Top 40 Country hits in the process. The other was “Before the Next Teardrop Falls,” which would make ’s career after he recorded it in ‘74, but had originally been given a clunky, overdone reading by Duane Dee. Martell rescued the song from that torpid terrain with her penetrating, laser-focused delivery. Both songs hit the charts as singles in ‘69, before the album’s release, and Martell quickly became the first Black woman to perform on the Grand Ole Opry. A series of similarly groundbreaking national TV appearances followed. Upon the LP’s arrival, the other nine songs that make up Martell’s maddeningly slim solo catalog underscored the extent of her gift. The majority of the tracks were penned by a female songwriting team, Margaret Lewis and Myra Smith, which was still unusual in testosterone-dominated Nashville. The pair gave Martell a couple of old-school honky-tonkers, complete with Ray Price-style shuffle. She let loose a full-bodied yodel on one, album-opener “Bad Case of the Blues,” signaling from the start that she meant business. Her bell-like tone on the other, “I Almost Called Your Name,” was offset by some electric sitar licks just so nobody forgot what year it was. Most of the other Lewis/Smith tunes are more in keeping with the rock/pop-informed rhythms country was beginning to adapt at the time, like the almost CCR-ish “Old Letter Song” and the folk-rock-inflected ballad “Tender Leaves of Love.” Even in her R&B past, Martell was never one to slather a tune with melisma, and here she keeps her phrasing country, plain and simple. But the power of her soulful chops still comes through, lending her pipes an extra jolt of electricity. The album hosts a fair number of weepers, but Martell gets to strut some attitude on the kiss-off cut “You’re Crying Boy, Crying,” a sort of Nashville equivalent to “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” with a locomotive pace and reverb guitar. Martell seems to have been perfectly positioned for a long, successful run. But it’s tragically unsurprising that a Black female country singer in 1970 would bump up against some major obstacles from both the business and audience sides. A combo platter of patriarchy and racism (it’s not insignificant that Singleton’s label was called Plantation Records) painted Martell into a corner, and by 1974 her life as a full-time singer was done. She never stopped singing, but she never released another record, and over time the name Linda Martell receded into obscurity.", "genre": ["Country"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/linda-martell-color-me-country-70th-anniversary-remaster-review"}

Throughout the ’80s and ’90s, Lake performed with the World Saxophone Quartet and recorded sessions with everyone from   to  . An explosive and imaginative player and composer, Lake’s music is a continuation of the spiritual call-to-arms sounded by the originators of the free-jazz movement.  is a Philadelphia-based ensemble whose music combines Afro-Cuban musical traditions with adventurous free-improvisation. For   Sonic Liberation Front takes up the task of bringing Lake’s first vocal compositions to life. Featuring The Sonic Liberation Singers—a quartet of vocalists affiliated with Philly’s University of the Arts—  ranges from abstract vocalization to Lake’s poetry recitations. The album opens with “What,” a grooving, mid-tempo tune built around Matt Engle’s bassline deftly mirrored by harmonizing singers. Veteran Philly free-jazz saxophonist Elliot Levin delivers a playfully searching solo, while Veronica Jurkiewiczs’s violin solo is electrifying and nearly psychedelic. “Ain’t Nothin’ But Love” is a gorgeous, utopian tune about the divine power of love. As the Sonic Liberation Singers lay out a sweet bed of vocal harmonizes behind him, Lake steps to the mic to inform us that “It ain’t hard to understand love once you know how it works. Love, the precious gift. Ain’t nothin real but love…” The title track, “Justice,” finds the entire ensemble playing together beautifully: drummer Kevin Diehl and Engle lay down a dynamic, ever-shifting rhythmic template over weighty, mournful melodies by Jurkiewicz and flutist Jameka Gordon. Levin’s solo here is particularly furious, his scorching, circular lines pushing us to the edge of collapse. It’s not all continued momentum, though: “Clouds” is a drifting suite that opens with Diehl soloing on percussion before joining the vocal section. Here, Gordon and Jurkiewicz improvise, making distinct melodic statements while also skillfully interacting with each other. The album closes on an optimistic, triumphant upswing. “Round 2000” is a rich, understated piece that again finds the singers mirroring Engle’s grooving, economical basslines. “Round 2000” seems to flow seamlessly into the album’s closer, “Lucky One.” The tune’s opening melody sets the tone before the rhythm section enters alongside Lake’s vivid poem and his detailed cataloging of land, locations, and ancestral memories. As Lake’s first set of compositions that center on the voice,  utilizes singing and poetry as humanizing elements that ground the music throughout. As interpreters of Lake’s compositions, Sonic Liberation Front brings a musical depth and openness to the proceedings that compliment Lake’s pieces. As idiosyncratic as it is spirited and fiery,  is an exciting and intriguing release from Sonic Liberation Front and one of jazz’s most unique living voices.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/sonic-liberation-front-justice-the-vocal-works-of-oliver-lake-review"}

Three releases later, the Cincinnati band has morphed from a solo project into a five-piece, in the process embracing a fuller sound while carrying forward their unpretentious coldwave roots. On this stellar  , layers of sound expertly dance over one another, as on the slinky “Hunting Knife,” with snippets of skronky horns, krautrock-style effects, and electronic drums. The songs are mostly new. Two show up on earlier releases, though these versions are brighter, clearer, as if glowing with white-hot energy. The record makes the case for proceeding slowly and steadily; the band sounds as if it’s really had a chance to grow into a mature, cohesive unit. These days, Andie Luman has taken over lead vocal duties from the band’s founder Dakota Carlyle. She masterfully sets the mood of each track, from the whispers on the new-wave-y “Vision Talk” to the echoey cries on the eerie, hard-edged “Damrak.” Crime of Passing often harks back to an early ‘80s sound, like on the darkly pop “Ways of Hiding”—not unlike Texas band  —but it does so without being kitschy. Luman’s voice rings true; her words feel urgent and tinged with romantic desire, as if she’s pleading with us to listen. If you were to catch a live show, I imagine the effect would be quite like this record sounds. The band’s take on post-punk isn’t super polished, like a lot of other contemporary bands. But it doesn’t get much closer to perfection than the one-two punch of the upbeat “Tender Fixation” followed by the mellow “Vision Talk,” an earlier version of which was teased as a single last year. The former glitters with guitar harmonics, surfy riffs, and filtered, Karen O.-style yelps. It’s infectious. Luman brings us low, with spoken utterances that sound as if they’re delivered through an overhead speaker, and then high, with prolonged howls that rise above the instrumentation. The latter is quietly lush, with layers of bright keys, guitar, and bass that complicate Luman’s pained vocals. Crime of Passing shares members with   and  , two other vibrant, eclectic Cincinnati outfits—and there is definitely sonic overlap here.

In South Africa,   as a political and intellectual tendency had developed out of the country’s vicious anti-apartheid struggle. In the U.S., the Civil Rights movement also energized Black folks nationwide and won significant legal reforms. In the intro to the 1995 book,  , historian George M. Fredrickson noted “the remarkable congruence” between these two freedom movements. As each movement emphasized Black cultural autonomy alongside calls for political self-determination, the radical mood among Black folks in both countries naturally influenced the music being made at the time. Upon arriving in the U.S., Xaba linked up with Black American musicans Kent “Shabalala” Parker, James “Plunky” Branch, and Lon Moshe to form Ndikho Xaba and the Natives, a free jazz ensemble that incorporated the various musical traditions of the African diaspora into a powerful whole. Speaking with us for  , the band that he formed after leaving Ndikho Xaba and the Natives, Branch explains that during his time playing with Xaba, he came to understand the deep kinship between the music of African Americans and Africans on the continent. “He taught me all about Africa. What I heard from the music of South Africa was that it was very closely related to what   and some of the spiritual, avant-garde musicians were doing.” Branch says. “I saw a direct relationship between that music and South African traditional music.” In 1971, Ndikho Xaba and the Natives released their  , an expansive five track behemoth that celebrates the fact that jazz‘s spiritual and cultural roots lie in Africa. The album opens with “Shwabadam” a 12-minute piece that spends most of its runtime building upon a steady pulse of unrelenting tension. By the seven-minute mark, Xaba explodes on piano, splattering furious chords and tone clusters all over Kieta’s rolling, thunderous toms. “Freedom” is a slow-tempo blues with a rhythm augmented by congas. The lyrics are a direct and unflinching plea for liberation: “You know they say that freedom…it’s a constant struggle. We struggled so long in search of freedom. So many have died…When are we going to be free?” With cuts like the abstract instrumental piece “Flight” and “Nomusa,” with its slow, Afro-Latin jazz groove,   is wide-ranging but intentional.

It’s not a statement that one generally associates with a free jazz trumpeter and a drummer/electronics wizard, but it’s impossible to miss the punk spirit on the duo’s third album. Even its most heavily produced moments capture a sense of rawness. The energy is even more unexpected given the surface aspects of the album. The album’s title, its psychedelic-cartoon cover (by branch), and its track titles—all related to an alternate, aquatically based perspective of the world—suggest something precious. The actual music couldn’t be further from that. Take, for example, its shortest track, the three-and-a-half minute “Baby Bota Halloceanation.” The horn, drums, and producer/guest musician  s bass and keyboards all drip with weird reverb. Instead of softening the impact, however, the effects heighten the aggression. The result is something like a rock guitar on maximum volume and overdrive. branch’s trumpet is harder, denser, more directly in your face, Nazary’s angry cymbals seem to grow razor-sharp edges, while Parker’s contributions remain subtle and unobtrusive, and in the process create an underlying sense of menace. If there’s something psychedelic afoot (and there is), it’s not so much the candy-colored utopia of the Grateful Dead as the dark labyrinths of  ’s early fusion era. That’s not an accidental comparison. Both branch and Nazary consider electric Miles to be a touchstone in their music, along with contemporary electronica and hip-hop. (The instrumental second half of “Earthlings” would work perfectly as the background of a rap track.) Nobody would have called Miles “punk” either, but his casual flipping of the bird to convention and his willingness to alienate his most devout disciples make the comparison hard to avoid. Anteloper channels his vibe in other respects, too—like his use of African music elements, which manifest here in percussionist  ’s mbira playing on “Delfin Rosado.” Its wind-chime-like timbre has a softer feel than anything else on  ; still, something about its relentless repetitions in Taylor’s hands makes it feel as defiant and forthright as everything surrounding it. It’d be a mistake, though, to pin   too close to Miles’s fusion records. They’re a reference point; the trudging yet pulsating, ambient yet abrasive “One Living Genus” is a sound that no one but Anteloper could make. Nor is it correct that there’s no semblance of refinement in their playing. In particular, branch’s singing (which she introduced on her 2019 album ) shows some new polish and control when she plies it on “Earthling.” Perhaps the takeaway is that growing as an artist need not mean mellowing.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/anteloper-pink-dolphins-review"}

But while Los Calvos never performed live or achieved major renown, their legacy as patron saints of avant-garde salsa was cemented with quirky musical choices that stretched the boundaries of salsa as it was known then, and even now. Salsa is of course a meticulously balanced marriage of anthemic songwriting, blaring horns, and dizzying percussion, though back in the late 1960s, Perez had the unusual idea of adding a drum kit to the mix. According to the liner notes, drummer Frank “El Pavo” Hernández famously likened the suggestion to eating pasta with avocado, but the instrument’s faster, more resonant possibilities shine especially bright on “Suenan Los Cueros.” The song has become one of Los Calvos’s most emblematic cuts as it also showcases the tremendous prowess of one of the group’s two main vocalists, Carlos “Calaven” Yanes, who begins scatting wildly in a fierce duel with Hernandez’s dazzling drum solo. While “Suenan Los Cueros” highlights the band’s jazz sensibilities, “El Marciano” nods at sci-fi camp, prominently featuring a glass harp melody that recalls flying saucers in black and white celluloid. The silly premise of Calaven going for a night on the town with a martian again allows enough flexibility for his nimble vocal improvisations, often breaking into gibberish or having his vocals played in reverse. Los Calvos’s other vocalist Carlos “Carlín” Asicio Rodríguez also holds his own, helming a fantastic call and response singalong on “Tiene la Razón” and handily cutting through booming percussion on “El Tumbeleco.” As musical director, Perez also takes every opportunity to shine, sculpting the rhythmic backbone for the delectable rumba jam “La Lengua” from behind the keys. Meanwhile on “José,” Perez fully steals the spotlight with a soaring piano solo that slowly crescendos from behind Calaven’s cheeky improvisations and transforms into the song’s effervescent centerpiece. You can hear the musicians playfully one-upping each other throughout  !, clearly more interested in capturing exciting studio spontaneity than aiming for a hit. No doubt, cuts like “Salsa y Sandunga” and “La Rumba Te Llama” could fit neatly into  ‘s glimmering catalog of standards, but there was never anything neat about Los Calvos or their music. This is wild, raucous salsa from the tropics, forged with Venezuelan humor and inventiveness and unencumbered by rules.", "genre": ["Latin", "salsa"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/los-calvos-y-que-calvos-review"}

Noise musicians, adventurous club kids, and world music aficionados alike were all struck by that irreducible  ! It’s a sound both ancient—archeologists have found such tines dating back 1000 years—and futuristic. The intervening years have done little to dampen the thrill. That buzz of tradition and modernity lies at the heart of  , an electric, convivial, and thoroughly raucous celebration that sloughs off all notions of time, nationality, and distance. Credited to Congotronics International, the all-star supergroup contains members of the original Konono N°1 alongside the likes of  ,  ,  ,  , and Skeletons’s  . Across some 23 tracks, it delivers a messy, sweaty dance party, one with roots stretching back to a European tour entitled   which was staged 11 years ago. Spacetime becomes a really squishy thing here. Is it a live document? A studio creation? Yes and no. It feels informal and constructed, spontaneous and practiced, but trying to dissect it all ruins the fun. The album’s title refers to the musicians trying to decide just where the “one” falls, but the title track itself is pure sugar rush, as if simply getting everyone on the same stage generated pure energy, with guitars thrust to the front, riding alongside the locomotive percussion. It’s insightful to hear the dialogue between the musicians sprinkled throughout the set as they figure out rhythms, counts, and more. Live bits bump into studio creations, yet feel inseparable. Like an amplified Ferris wheel careening off its axis, the amplified kalimba comes to the fore on “Kule Kule Redux,” giving everything a new dimension. There’s a delirious, shredding duet between guitar and kalimba on “For Augustin,” and on “Mulume/Change,” the kalimbas buzz like a hornet’s nest. The group chants atop a tumble of interweaving guitars make the song feel like juju music one minute, angular post-punk the next. Deerhoof’s Greg Saunier admits to the messiness of making the project cohere: “Real democracy is not utopia. The whole band was based in a struggle to communicate.” “Mulume/ Change” appears to grapple with that process out in the open: “If we stay the same/ What will become of us then?” the lyrics ask. As the big group reaches the end of the song, though, there’s an audible sense of exhaustion, relief, joy, with Congolese traditional, European experimental, and American punk rock getting tangled up in each other. You can’t always tell exactly when or where it all went down, or who made which noise, but   nevertheless sounds like a great party.", "genre": ["Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/congotronics-international-wheres-the-one-review"}
{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0028001219_2.jpg", "album": "WEMA", "artist": "WEMA", "description": "Towards the end of the first pandemic summer, one that featured some of the biggest mass social-justice protests in a generation, the Upstate New York-based electronic producer   (Evan Shorstein) released   by the London’s Afro-Latin dance band Penya. At the time, the song’s lyrical refrain,“Are you doing it for the people, or are you trying to just hide away,” coupled with the natural blend of Photay and Penya’s complementary sensibilities felt anthemic. “People” demanded that artists and listeners not just align with the right side of history, but choose how to live through it, consciously leaping into the meaning of a moment that was at once specific and open-ended. WEMA—the remote-recording pandemic collective that reunites Photay with members of   (producer “Magnus P.I.” Mehta, vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Lilli Elina, percussionist Jimmy le Messurier), as well as  , musical scion of Tanzania’s first family of Gogo music—is a natural continuation of that desire, expanding global connectivity through rhythm and folkways. The hippie intentions of the group’s name—Swahili for kindness and benevolence—ring out in lyrics that endorse a sensible, spiritually reflective existence. But it’s the tension between WEMA’s words and musical choices (polyglot instrumental pairings, thick beat layers of drums and machines, psychedelic post-production crevices) that push   beyond mere platitudes. This music is a positivist rage against the modern-world machine, powered by the force of trance-like improvised rituals, as practiced in different parts of the world. Most of  ’s tracks are two-parters—Part 1’s primarily sung in Swahili by Zawose, and Part 2’s primarily by Elina in Spanish—though they’re less like the flip-sides of old R&B singles or Jamaican versions than two different spins on a single idea, or a beat. Next to one another, they present cohesive juxtapositions of humanity as a cultural kaleidoscope. “Luanje” is one great example. On Part 1, Zawose is in call-and-response mode: his deeply processed vocal trying to shake off generational trauma, surrounded by wood-block and shakers, electronic bass-plus-kick-drum gyrations that hold forth their own staccato conversation, and sampled voices bending beyond comprehension. Halfway through this chaos, a kora appears alongside Elina singing about taking refuge in the shadow of a ceiba tree. When Zawose returns, the previous elements have coalesced in a rolling mid-tempo Afrobeat techno atmosphere, with Magnus’ organ recalling Fela’s Egypt 70. Part 2 picks up from Elina’s short appearance: leading with the kora, interweaving guitar and organ lines, lightly toasted percussion, and ominous sound effects, all taken at a fraction of its predecessor’s pace and intensity. Elina’s song is about the generational reverberations of an aging tree, taking the form of a naturalist sunrise salutation; and it’s not hard to see the relationship between the two parts. “Msafiri Jam” is even better. “Pt. 1” sets up a high-speed acoustic African-dance atmosphere (a bolafon that sounds like it’s on Sun Ra’s cosmic trip, various hand-drums, a break-neck hi-hat), before synthesizers start sneaking into the mix, in and around Zawose’s big group call–and-response; yet the longer its glorious chaos continues, the more modernity’s ghost voices make their presence felt. “Pt.2” keeps the tempo, but leads with the type of kick-drum sound whose influence has escaped Berlin for Dar Es Salaam. The bolafon now sounds entirely synthetic, Elina’s incantation is in the service of pure dance exultation, and when Cuban trumpeter Yelfris Valdes shows up to lead a horn-line, the energy transforms into something that could emanate from ceremonial good times on either side of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Listening to such intricate musical mutations, charting their rhythmic routes, is another way of asking what kind of life we want for ourselves, and for the world. There is something magnanimously obvious and direct in WEMA’s answer. But maybe that’s the best way to make listeners consider it as a true option.  ", "genre": ["World"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/wema-wema"}

After vaporous passages of processed chamber music and a flourish of chirpy electronics (performed by Mari Maurice, aka  ), we’re left in the hiss of rousay’s open microphones. Gradually, a voice begins speaking, but the blur of low-volume recording, background noise, and the speaker’s hushed tone makes it hard to tell if they’re saying they “love,” “left,” or “lost,” someone. Each word speaks to a sense of impermanence and unknowing that rousay, leading a band of friends and frequent collaborators, captures throughout what may be her finest album yet. One of the great things about rousay’s music is that she never lets you get too lost in it. The Austin-based musician has created some of the best ambient music being made today, but her work is just as likely to jar you with a sudden windswept microphone or murmur of conversation, a joke, or a song. It is music that pushes back at you, reaching out with sounds and words. “A Kind Of Promise” ended last year’s   with a tender piano and cello duet, complemented by blurts of sped-up tape noise. Each of the players on  bring an immense intimacy to the proceedings. Early in the sprawling first track “it feels foolish to care,” Marilu Donovon of   plays harp alongside a soft clatter of timbres and voices, while pianist   provides a profoundly emotional close that feels like listening in on a rehearsal. Yet rather than these pieces feeling like a glimpse into some imagined space, rousay’s careful treatment of sound and editing is only heightened when played inside a real one. Her close-mic’d textures—gentle sensations you nonetheless brace for—grow even more effective when they can fill a room, imparting themselves in the moment with each passage of beauty, disruption or weight. Just as the small sounds of  gradually feel vast, so too does its emotional scope. It’s an album that brings so much in both moments of sadness and joy.

It is the outcome of four artists who have crossed paths over the years putting their quarantine sanity projects together in a game of long-distance musical telephone, an incredible band emerging seemingly out of nowhere with minimal effort and most decisions made casually over Instagram DMs. In August of 2020, Thomas was recording music all day every day at home, because it felt weird to do anything besides work on music indoors. Plump reached out to Thomas after seeing a video he posted to Instagram about how he got a cool drum sound using a single mic on top of the kick drum, asking if Thomas would send him some drum loops to use on the recordings he had been making. Plump eventually reeled in Matthew Rolin, whose unique style of guitar playing changed the whole direction of the project. (Notably, this record marks the first time Rolin has played electric guitar at all in years, particularly in a band setting.) Though originally Plump tried vocals on the songs, they didn’t work. Everyone was surprised and delighted when they asked Whitney Johnson to contribute her voice and she obliged. It’s difficult to believe they’ve never all been in the same room. At times ripping and rollicking, like on opener “Monsella,” that pace often dissipates into more ambient kosmische zones (“Central Ceiling,” “Stone Oaks”). There is a definitive dreaminess to the record—largely the result of Rolin’s guitar playing, Thomas’s synth overdubs, and Johnson’s signature use of voice as emotive texture rather than discernible verbal messages—and a sense of forward motion maintained by Thomas’s drum loops and Plump’s basslines, which often propel as much as they waver, darting psychedelically in and out. But moments like “Lasso Motel” might make one wonder where exactly we are and how exactly we got here. The use of field recordings and occasional radio dial sounds in between tracks contributes to the sense that we are shifting in and out of different channels or realities—almost like we are being encouraged to take charge of our own through the audio controls. Despite its origins in remote collaboration, this is music for open roads and shifting skies; a soundtrack for driving into uncharted territory.   functions reflexively as a title—as both a refusal to become isolated in the quarantined world and an adventure to a dream place outside, forged from many different insides.", "genre": ["Experimental", "folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/winged-wheel-no-island"}

Her 2019 debut,  , grew into a cohesive album from vivid, bright-hued phrases that featured forward-looking melodies and lush harmonies.  , her latest, continues to explore the ways music unfurls, but here, she splinters off in many directions. Frenetic improvisation and wistful meditation come in waves throughout the album. Throughout  , Vandever and her longtime ensemble strike a delicate balance between urgency and rest. The album is more agitated and volatile than Vandever’s previous work, yet it continues to evoke a sense of hope and brightness, even in its darkest moments. It also often feels like a dialogue, propelled by her ensemble’s intuition: They’re having a conversation through music about what it means to heal, blemishes and all. That idea comes through the strongest in the album’s structure, where pieces continually build from small phrases into something larger. “Passing Thoughts” begins with muted, plinking piano and sporadic rhythms that tumble out like an unfinished thought; trombone and drums echo those rhythms until they reach a fever pitch and burst into an ecstatic melody. The ballad “An Unwelcome Visit” moves in similar fashion, building from a tense, frenzied rhythm into a lush palette of melancholy trombone and saxophone mixed with twinkling piano. There’s a sense of expansion throughout—as if each track is in a state of perpetual development. Much of   features the ecstatic, brilliant melodies that have become Vandever’s signature sound, and a few, in particular, provide pause for deeper reflection. “Lift” foregrounds an emphatic, poignant electric guitar melody that’s paired with drums to create a slowed-down, pensive atmosphere. “More of The Good Stuff Later” takes this ruminative tone even further: The ensemble hangs in near stillness, moving in large, repeating loops at a glacial pace until they eventually expand into vivid harmonies. It’s here where   feels like it’s arrived at its destination, moving forward from the turbulence of the healing process and into the next chapter. By the end of  , there’s resolution, and even a hint of celebration. One of the album’s earlier melodies returns for a brilliant, unison reprise and one final moment of resolution.

Invented sometime in the late 1880s, its distinctive style of play was, so the   goes, born from a happy accident. While toting around an old Spanish guitar, 16-year-old   spotted a railroad spike on the ground. Picking it up, he was, later that day, struck by the inspiration to run the spike across the strings, making the instrument sing in an unfamiliar way. Kekuku would continue to experiment with teasing novel sounds from his guitar with objects; first he used the back of a knife, then a steel comb, before finally fashioning a polished metal bar similar to the type still used today. The resulting technique—a resonant tone with shimmering vibrato—spread rapidly across the islands, becoming one of the most preferred instruments for accompanying traditional Hawaiian song. But the steel guitar wouldn’t stop there, going on to dig its roots deep into American popular music. The influence of the indigenous style on everything from Delta blues to country music would go underrepresented in our music histories for over a century, but documents like  are valuable for setting the record straight. Sourced from   pressed during a period when Hawaiian music was flooding the American mainland, the compilation tells the story of the steel guitar’s rise to prominence. While the musical landscape of the island was experiencing a renaissance, Hawaiians were simultaneously fighting for their home and their identity. White business owners were privatizing communal land and displacing the native people, paving the way for the United States to move in and   the Hawaiian monarchy. The Hawaiian language and several cultural practices were promptly banned, politicizing the mere act of performing familiar songs. Amid this mercurial climate, many Hawaiian musicians fled to the contiguous states, hoping their talents would afford them a better life. To say that their skills were appreciated is an understatement; Hawaiian music would transcend the boundaries of class and race, appearing everywhere from the backwoods of the American heartland to ritzy Hollywood nightclubs. (Kekuku himself resettled in the states, playing   shows across the country.) By the mid-1910s, Hawaiian steel guitar records had become enormously popular. Listening to the sampling of music on  , the give-and-take between musicians from all walks of American life is clear. Ben Waiaiole’s undulating vocals on “Moanalua,” slipping between deeper registers and falsetto, are not unlike the distinctive “blue yodel” of country music royalty  , who would employ Hawaiian steel guitarists on many of his records. Ben Hokea plays a straight blues number on “Annie Laurie,” using long slides to make his instrument wail out in lament. Suddenly, it makes a lot more sense why great bluesmen like Tampa Red and   called their style of play “the Hawaiian way,” and why   kept Hawaiian steel guitar songs in his arsenal all the way up to his final sessions. It’s said that history is written by the victors; more often than not, that translates to the people with the most colonial power. Indigenous voices tend to get written out of the narratives, which necessitates being open to the stories we don’t often hear. There’s a lot of work to be done before the Hawaiian people are given their due for helping to shape the common language of American music—but fortunately, if you take the time to listen, the music speaks for itself.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/a-chant-about-the-beauty-of-the-moon-at-night-hawaiian-steel-guitar-masters-1913-1921-review"}

But the record, B&S’s tenth, is a spot-on showcase for so many of the strengths and sensibilities that’ve made them a leading light in indie music for a quarter-century and counting. With a grip of good tunes, a handful of great ones, and no filler to speak of,  ‘s dozen songs don’t lack for passion nor variety, tackling subject matter both quotidian and universal—often simultaneously—with the gentle, painterly hand of bandleader Stuart Murdoch trademarked with 1996’s flawless  and its nearly-as-good ’98 follow-up  Throwbacks par excellence include the punchy rave-up “Unnecessary Drama,” with its lengthy, loping hook—and meanest, most unhinged harmonica on a B&S track since  ‘s “Me And The Major”—and the driving, synth-accented “Talk To Me, Talk To Me,” a monument to subversive across-the-pond pop equal parts   elegance,   danceability, and  -like piss-and-vinegar. “Come On Home” boasts a corker of a chorus that hearkens back to 2003’s carefree, celebratory catalog standout  . Elsewhere, violinist Sarah Martin and erstwhile six-stringer Stevie Jackson make their vocal turns count. The former lends her dulcet Scottish lilt to the sparse, moody “Reclaim the Night” and jaunty, melodious “A World Without You”; the latter delivers a starry-eyed country interlude with the pedal steel-accented waltz “Deathbed of My Dreams.” Still, this is not the same world B&S emerged in, as Murdoch acknowledged ahead o us’s release. “We’d started rolling out tracks for the album and it all felt silly, to be honest,” admitted the 54-year-old musician in a PR statement. To that end, for the video for lead single “If They’re Shooting At You,” he and his bandmates sourced photography and video from Ukrainian artists to signal-boost ways of sending direct aid to the embattled Eastern European country.

The Chicago cellist and multi-disciplinary artist has been recognized as a skilled player in both modes, lending her talents to a multitude of artists, from   to   to  . Kohl has made a reputation for herself over the past few years as a supporting pillar of Chicago’s experimental scene, though her name isn’t yet widely known outside of it. Inevitably, an ambitious artist will begin to well up with desire to realize their own creative vision, so Kohl started hitting the studio by herself. The building blocks of her debut album   were collected mostly on the unplanned whims of a series of moments, assembling them with deliberate care later down the line. Finally, a fully-formed display of her abilities was beginning to take shape. “Every day I would go into my studio and make something,” Kohl explains in the album notes, “even if it was a one minute synth loop or a tiny cello improvisation.” On “First Picture of the Weather Pattern” the careful stratification of these sedimentary layers can be heard as the track begins with a ghostly synth loop punctuated by deep reverberating plucks from Kohl’s cello. The crackling of a radio cuts in, occasionally blasting out bite-sized pieces of a melody before giving way to static, as if the dial is in a position between stations. It works as a densely textured piece if you like, but fractals off into a plethora of optional adventures when focusing on an element and trying to isolate it. The eight-plus minute “Moon Bean” takes a more cinematic approach, weaving improvised cello drones into latticework. Mostly keeping ever-so-slightly out of phase, they occasionally sing together in a continuous loop of losing and finding. The effect here is different, but the result is the same: a growing awareness through each track of how each component interacts with all the others. Kohl’s compositions have a similar character to the elaborate spreads of the   books you might have read as a kid: A collection of seemingly disparate things at first glance, but once under the magnifying glass it becomes clear they couldn’t have been arranged that way by accident.

In a matter of days, bedrooms became movie theaters, couches were converted into offices, kitchens turned into experimental bakeries—for many of us, our homes were suddenly our whole world. For Carolyn Brennan and Ian Corrigan, the unforeseen time at home gave birth to what they call a “living room project,” aka a noisy pop band called   that, unlike a lot of quarantine hobbies, lives on today.

If there’s a thematic thread running through  , it’s the persistent frustration that pervades everyday life. On “Living A Lie” Brennan takes aim at an exhausting energy vampire over speedy thrash-pop. “You used to be a sanctuary,” she sings, “now you’re just a parasite.”’ On the record’s catchiest song “Push You Aside” she delivers a scathing send-off to an overbearing suitor. Elsewhere, she targets ennui and stagnation (“Shot Down”), insecurity (“A Trip Home”), and self-centered assholes (“No Excuse”).

One of those labels was   whose brief lifespan ended when they began shifting away from the homegrown sounds that had been influences on the label—jazz funk, Brit funk, and lover’s rock—in an attempt to compete with the New Jack Swing that was dominating the Billboard charts in the United States. Numero Group’s new retrospective compilation   scrambles that timeline with its non-linear sequencing, resulting in a collection that celebrates the label’s legacy in offering R&B and house with a positive message. It was an 18-year-old from South London named Julie Stapleton who first got V4 Vision blasting on the pirate airwaves with “Just Dreaming” in 1991. Stapleton’s hit rides a mid-tempo beat that draws on lover’s rock and has a synth line in the opening seconds that’s such an earworm, you’ll find yourself looking forward to its return. Stapleton’s single was not about head-in-the-clouds euphoria—it was an extension of Martin Luther King Jr.’s  . It was also a B-side; V4 Visions was hoping to capture listeners with the hypnotic deep house of “Where’s Your Love Gone”—which later found success as a cover by Kylie Minogue on her 1994 self-titled album, earning Stapleton a certified gold plaque. (By contrast, singles from V4 Visions maxed out at 500 copies.) Endangered Species’s convergence of UK’s soul jazz and New York garage house caught the attention of legendary U.S. dance label Strictly Rhythm, who licensed singles from both Endangered Species and fellow V4 Visions artist Ashaye, earning the label international hits. One of the label’s last singles, “Joy In The Jungle” by Jungle Biznizz, is a direct nod to the emerging jungle scene; V4 Visions would cease operations just as jungle and drum & bass began to dominate the dance clubs. It didn’t help that the label was also up against the notorious government crackdowns on dance music, under accusations that nightclubs were hedonistic drug havens corrupting the British youth. Ironically, V4 Visions’s soulful house and street soul was rooted in socio-political messages that defied the mischaracterizations of the music. “Just Dreaming” gave the label an audience beyond the dance floor, but in its later years, the label attempted to capitalize on the New Jack Swing fad—a decision the founders have said that, in hindsight, they regret. Street soul indies like V4 Visions rarely found mainstream chart success, but their legacies resonate to this day in artists like  , FKA Twigs, and Erykah Badu, who take cues from the era’s indelible experimental moments.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-v4-visions-of-love-and-androids-review"}

A side project of Melbourne indie pop darlings  , the quartet became a trio when drummer Cameron Smith made off for London. The remaining members—guitarist Andrew Withycombe, bassist Bart Cummings, and vocalist Kerrie Bolton—decided to fill the empty space with something different. Playing around with sample-based beats, tape loops, and whatever sound they could tease out from a borrowed Roland Jupiter-4 synth, they cut together a sound collage short enough to fit on a 7-inch record—and planned to call it quits right after. The deceptively titled “ ,” released in 1996, was never supposed to have a follow-up; the group’s aim was to punctuate the Hydroplane experiment with a question mark, leaving any would-be fan to wonder if the album would ever arrive. At the insistence of their label, however, they would turn that lie into the truth the following year. Immediately, their sound was distinguishable from the more uptempo tunes of their previous moniker. In the absence of a live drummer, they sample a shuffling breakbeat on “Wurlitzer Jukebox,” giving the track an almost hip-hop flavor. On tracks like “Song for the Meek,” they forgo percussion entirely; Bolton’s dreamy vocals hover in a delicate dance with a filigree of guitar and synth, becoming weightless. Elsewhere, they use short vignettes to experiment with different permutations of the building blocks of their new ensemble. On “House Warming,” Bolton delivers a spoken word story about a walk to the beach while a sustained drone swells up underneath. “LDR” strips back to a ticking percussive loop, with no other accompaniment but a guitar strumming every other beat. The album draws to a close with the lush and hazy “Completed Extract from the Previous 7′,” its title a clever nod to the fulfillment of a promise they fully intended to break. As radical a departure as Hydroplane’s self-titled debut seems, the band simply saw it as an extension of the groundwork they had already laid. “We’d always done those things, but with The Cat’s Miaow, it would have been one song on a single that was more experimental,” Withycombe   earlier this year. “This time, we seemed to condense those ideas into a single record.” They’d be met with modest international recognition for their foray into new frontiers, earning themselves frequent airplay on English DJ and kingmaker John Peel’s radio show—even appearing on Peel’s prestigious Festive Fifty yearly roundup for 1997. They went on to release a run of singles with U.S. and UK labels they developed relationships with by writing letters, largely sidestepping their local scene.

The duo puts a unique spin on hip-hop’s classic MC/DJ configuration; both artists play multiple instruments, which adds a live dimension to the soundscapes that they create together. For their latest album,   Raw Poetic and Damu create spiritually attuned hip-hop that threads together both deep longing and optimism.

Raw Poetic’s flow here is nimble and melodic as his words urge us to grasp for hope while daring us to keep “whispering loud enough for the whole world to hear it.” The eight-minute multi-part epic “Hey Autumn Pt. 1 and When Autumn Replied Pt. 2” is not only an emotional journey, it highlights Damu and Raw Poetic’s ambition and craftsmanship. Walking listeners through the joys of life: birth, childhood, love, and beyond, Raw Poetic’s streaming, imagery-dense lyricism makes more of an emotional impression rather than adhering to any strict narrative. About halfway through, the arrangement collapses into a haze of electric pianos, conga, and turntable scratching. Once the drums and bass grooves return at full power it feels like listeners are being taken on a sonic journey around the world and back.

Founded by multi-instrumentalist Mike Lee as a bedroom recording project in 2004, the band developed a seamless blend of cozy electronica and hazy guitar pop, gaining a foothold in the late ‘00s as like-minded artists included   and   channeled their forebears via laptop. Lee’s work during this period felt more like patchwork than the pastiche of his chillwave peers, experimenting with shoegaze, chamber pop, and even IDM over the course of each album. With  however, the band takes a survey of their discography and selects their best ideas, crafting their most consistent, confident sound to date. Critics have been keen to compare them to New Order in the past, but on  , Letting Up sound like the lesser-known Factory signees that put a dreamy, cute spin on Hook and Sumner’s signature sound. The Wake and  , undervalued for bridging the gap between post-punk and twee pop, are the most apparent historical analogs, peeling away a layer of synth and distortion to highlight the jangly melodies at their core. By scaling back the shoegaze-inspired density of his earlier work, Lee has given his voice room to breathe and unfurl within the mix. “I have to have my house in order to be happy here,” he sighs on “Softly, Bravely.” Despite the song’s chipper exterior, Lee probes dark emotions in hushed tones, describing a codependency that comes at the expense of himself. Lee’s lyricism has traditionally fixated on the highs and lows of falling in and out of love, and that’s still the case on  . “Tumble,” shrouded in a thick layer of reverb, even directs Lee’s unrequited feelings inward, longing for lost youth as if one’s past self were a separate person entirely. Guitar riffs simmer and steep in their own juices, building in intensity until they nearly blot out the song’s percussion entirely: Here, Lee’s songwriting is so introspective that the instrumental itself seems to ruminate. Clocking in at just under a half-hour,  may be Letting Up’ shortest album, but it’s not for lack of ideas. Experience has honed the band’s efficient ethos, meaning no track overstays its welcome.

The record snakes its way through sensual funk, jazz, and electronic music, paired with lyrics that speak of resilience and sincerity. On songs like “Thrive, Despite” and the funk and krautrock influenced “Call Me,” the duo release their insecurities and anguish and follow their visions for a better tomorrow.

It can be easy to only think of those words in pleasant contexts—as something soft or peaceful or pastoral—but the Montréal producer has something different in mind on her unsettling debut album  . Her sounds hang together like organs in a body, tightly wound and uncomfortably amorphous, each instrument at least partially digested, every tension unplaceable. Moving at a dreamlike pace while rarely rising above a whisper, Kee Avil has produced a debut of fiendish creativity filled with uniquely gentle terrors.  arrives four years after Kee Avil’s  —a brief three-track release built on guitar harmonics, ASMR vocalizations, and churning electronics—and its greatest strength is in the way Mettler tunnels deeper into that sparse foundation. From the ominous opener “See, my shadow,” Mettler lays out a palette that feels almost subterranean in its use of low-end from drilling electronics to cavernous chords played at the far end of the piano. Songs like “Drying” or “Melting Snow” embrace the void-like spaciousness of early industrial while making uneasy clearings that align the ghostly folk music of  and   to   at their most quietly tense. Every track builds on Mettler’s sound in entirely distinct ways—the prickling micro-cuts that run through “HHHH” like nerve pain, the spindly guitar harmonics twinkling through “And I,” Mark Molnar’s bottomless cello that emerges on the late highlight “Devil’s Sweet Tooth” like the monster in a horror movie’s third act. If there is a secret weapon on  however, it’s Mettler’s own voice and words. Her hushed, seemingly narrow range gradually widens into a chasm of close-mic’d intricacy with lyrics that get under your skin while giving little away—just like the eerie mask she wears in  ’s artwork and music videos, which is somewhere between papier-mâché and Leatherface. It’s here where  gets outright bone-chilling, finding emotional impact in abstraction, as on “Okra Ooze,” where Mettler repeats “What is the perfect balance?” with the maddening intensity of Scott Walker. But it’s the early highlight “saf” that haunts most of all, a song blurring heartache and disease with almost supernatural ambiguity. “Is this the same ache we all share?” she asks, before needling the question even deeper: “Can you feel it there?/ Under your ribs?/ Sitting with its feet up and going nowhere?” It’s a line you can almost physically feel, and it captures Kee Avil’s alluring debut as a whole.

Its songs balance between two extremes: the needs of the body and mind, and the pull of nature. It’s a tension that permeates Carolina Oliveros’s soulful wail in “Oya,” the album’s opening track and a harbinger of the journey that is to come. Oya is a powerful feminine deity—the first feminine   in the Yoruba religion—the goddess of storms and winds, protector of the dead, container for the duality between calm and despair. Over soft guitar arpeggios and atmospheric synths, Combo Chimbita capture a kind of ritualistic calmness—a suspended state that is soothing, but also carries with it the danger of a storm. The group conjures a whirlwind of genres: hip-hop breaks, cumbia, psychedelia, rock, and   serve as a backdrop to stories of racial and societal struggle, anger, love, transcendence, and healing—all of them with a spiritual twist. That songs like “Babalawo” and “La Perla” transform midway into drum sessions or experimental jams speaks to both the group’s frenetic energy and their willingness to break free of constraints and escape into safe, healing spaces. The music doesn’t dictate where you go, your body does, and these detours are a way to ignore the norm and dance with abandon. Nothing better encapsulates that ethos than “Memoria,” a song that can best be described as wonder and chaos in crescendo—a  an exorcism of sorts. The track begins with a lo-fi, old-school sample of a noir soundtrack then morphs into a slow, trip-hop beat, which clears a path for Olivero’s powerful voice. She sings cautiously about the memories of the body—“ ”—until the song climaxes into a cumbia sung by an ominous, distorted, mocking voice from an afterlife: “You don’t escape; you transform,” it sings in Spanish with a hearty laugh. Not even in death can you escape from the sins of the body, it seems to say; but death, while unforgiving, brings a transformation that absolves. The tension that manifests throughout the record—happiness and despair, life and death, spirit and body—reflects the period in which it was written and composed: In 2020, amidst a global pandemic, an exploding Black Lives Matter movement, and during recording sessions in Puerto Rico. The last part made the group aware of the suffocating realities of living in a U.S. colony, and gave them a palette to create an entrancing visual narrative that interpolates ritual and art. It’s also an inherently queer album; its lyrics explore sexuality, and an accompanying   provides a stage for trans and queer performance artists and artists of color to interpret Combo Chimbita’s songs.

The project’s downcast pop songs are written and recorded entirely in Donaldson’s San Francisco home.   is his fourth RP&Ps album in less than three years, and, not surprisingly, it is every bit as lovely as its predecessors. It’s a master class in doing more with less. Invariably, RP&Ps songs are built from Donaldson’s winsome vocal melodies, his sigh of a singing voice, restrained rhythm sections, gently played guitars (of the jangling electric and/or strummed acoustic variety) and, often, the soft glow of a keyboard or synth. In less capable hands, this is a mix that might grow tiresome after a while, but Donaldson uses the limits of the sound to his advantage by weaving an almost narcotic instrumental foundation that complements and enhances his gifts as a tunesmith and a storyteller. As a result, when he yawns his way through these lines in “Pour the Light In,” the effect is not devastating, but nostalgic and comforting: “Without love, the rest is sorrow/ ‘Til death will come in/ The grave’s a veil over paradise/ I’ve laid too long in what dreams were buried/ And did not grow here.” Donaldson has a knack for capturing universal feelings in interesting ways. “The air got colder in the room when you let me go,” he sings in “Let’s Pretend We’re Not in Love,” a pitch-perfect slice of melancholy indie pop. Later, in one of the album’s best choruses, he describes disillusionment as “feeling upside down in an empty room,” which feels strangely accurate. He also takes two opportunities here to play with the RP&Ps form a bit, producing a seven-minute-long lazy river of guitar chimes and tendrils on the title track and a pretty instrumental march embossed with a keyboard part that’s reedy, wheezing and wonderful (“Dahlias and Rain”). These are enjoyable jaunts, but by standing out, they highlight the consistency and the quality of the RP&Ps’s growing catalog. Glenn Donaldson is a brilliant songwriter on an incredible hot streak.

Despite the list of fanciful inventions credited to Hammond’s name, it is his B3 organ that has perhaps had the widest impact on music culture. As a smaller and cheaper alternative to the hulking pipe organs used in churches for centuries, they quickly became ubiquitous at concert halls and recording studios throughout the country. When the   debuted in 1953, the jazz world fully embraced the instrument’s bold, colorful sound and made the instrument a fixture in America’s greatest musical art form. The list of virtuoso jazz musicians who employed the Hammond B3 throughout the mid-1950s and early 1960s is as storied as it is extensive.   used the B3 to make music that celebrated jazz’s roots in the blues and gospel while expanding the music’s timbral and stylistic palette. For Kansas City, Missouri player  , the B3 was absolutely integral to his hard bop and soul jazz work. Throughout the 1960s, John Patton was an in-demand organist,   like   and Lou Donaldson and recording for the renowned Blue Note label.

The title track, written by Serbian trumpeter Duško Goyković, opens the album, anchored by a swinging rhythm, a gorgeous lead melodic line, and Patton’s effortless solo. Sparks shines on “Space Station,” attacking the tune’s main theme with his bright, cool tone and an inventive and dexterous solo that lands midway through the song. Clocking in at over 12 minutes, “The Coaster” is the album’s closer, a piece where the soloists really stretch out and explore. When Patton takes his final solo of the record, he paces himself, deftly introducing and countering his own melodic ideas as part of a sort of playfully self-contained call and response. As the intensity heats up, Patton makes his Hammond organ scream, reminding listeners that he was a master of one of jazz’s most important instruments.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/john-patton-soul-connection-review"}

Amapiano—which emerged from the townships of Gauteng province and  combines diBacardi rhythms and   melodies with jazzy keys and signature log drum samples—had already conquered S.A.’s clubs and radio stations after thriving on unofficial channels like file-sharing apps and local taxis. But few outside of S.A. had heard of it. Now, only two years on, amapiano has broken into the mainstream to become one of the biggest international club sounds and Teno Afrika one of its better known representatives abroad. The 22-year-old producer, whose real name is Lutendo Raduvha, is still very plugged into the music scene in Gauteng, and his new album   reflects that. Since starting as a mostly instrumental style, amapiano has now evolved to include dozens of subgenres, from the bouncy rhythms of “gong gong” amapiano to the more polished “Harvard” style (both of which featured on  ). Teno traces this evolution through his music: where his debut was almost entirely instrumental, “Where Are You” is laced with delicate, smokey vocals. The emphasis, though, is still clearly on production, and vocals are used sparingly to tease out subtle emotional textures. On the opening title track, Leyla’s sweetly soulful voice floats over an Afro-house-infused beat, creating a dreamlike atmosphere; KayCee’s voice is barely audible on “Fall in Love” until, at the halfway point, synths and percussion fall away, and the distorted vocal is clear for just a second before the beat kicks back in and the song suddenly changes gear. Similar switch-ups appear elsewhere on the album, and infuse these sprawling tracks with a sense of thrilling uncertainty. On songs like “Gomora Groove” and “Halaal Flavour,” the sudden flurry of percussion and unexpected vocal yelps keep you on your toes. It’s details like these that make  such an enthralling listen. The record also sees the return of two of Teno’s regular collaborators,   and  , each of whom add their personal touch. On “SK Love” and “AK Love” Diego Don layers wide synth pads and signature log drums to build a propulsive, dramatic effect, while on “Duma ICU” Stylo MusiQ explores the soulful sounds of Skrr Gong, one of amapiano’s latest variations.

Twenty years later, the Berlin-based producer is at his best blurring industrial, disco, and synth-pop while maintaining a fondness for the bombastic sounds on which he cut his teeth.

Filled with de Groot’s voyeuristic little details, the song is a masterclass in building tension and unplaceable dread that replicates another quality of   much more difficult to capture than Carter’s sonics—the ability to use suggestion and ambiguity to push an audience towards their own dark conclusions. “7 Foot Clown” remains entirely chaste, but its implications and power dynamics build like a panic attack, until de Groot finally runs over and pulls her friend out of the situation altogether.  only builds on the unique deliveries and grimy vibes laid out by this ominous opener. De Groot’s observations of a child on the propulsive disco track “Just Like His Dad” gradually draw you to the abusive figure out of frame, while Vitelli’s sprawling instrumental centerpiece “Patient Zero” perfects the album’s sleazy crawl. For all of  ’s tensions, its moments of release are explosive. The in-the-red EBM of “High Blood Pressure” follows the unsettling opener with a slow, crushing drum loop, and chunky low-end synths. “Down The Hatch” and “How Is It To Be You?” trade in snappy electro and wry humor, while the industrial slow-burn of “Trichophilia” walks a tightrope of S&M dynamics to create something both edgy and genuinely sexy. The album unexpectedly closes on “Don’t Sleep,” a blissful sunrise of warm synths and delicate guitar that only makes the preceding dream feel more vivid. Vitelli and de Groot may have come out of distinct scenes tied to specific eras, but on  they’ve created music that feels transcendent and timeless.

Few songs embody that truism better than the title track of  ’s latest album,  . The song’s stately, beatific pace is carefully teased out over its 13-minute length. El’Zabar marinates in the moments, letting the force of his plucked   burrow into the restrained caress of the horns from trumpeter   and saxophonist  . El’Zabar’s murmur prompts a slow but steady escalation in tempo and intensity, and keyboardist   becomes more prominent before the pace settles back down, and El’Zabar repeatedly declares “It’s time for healing.” Its sophisticated stirrings of tone, tempo, texture, and emotional investment provide a durably uplifting experience. El’Zabar has been on something of a roll lately. The longtime member of Chicago’s AACM, who chaired the organization from 1975-83, dropped two superb discs in 2020—  and  —utilizing past collaborators and peers such as saxophonists   and  .   is less incendiary, although the younger Wilkes and Collier still flex impressively when it fits the context. Always one to adhere to AACM’s credo of “ancient to the future,” El’Zabar has the entire quartet playing a panoply of indigenous African percussion. After a pair of rhythm-driven, vocal message-anthems, “Drum Talk” and “Urban Shaman,” he abruptly steers the ensemble into the soulful funk of a paean to fellow Chicagoan Eddie Harris, shouting out his late mentor-collaborator as a “harmonic genius.” The most straight-ahead jazz cut on the album is a boppish, dual-horned, in-the-pocket composition entitled “The Coming of Spring,” highlighted by Wilkes pealing off some rippling riffs. That deftly sets the stage for El’Zabar’s latest   tribute, a faithful cover of “Resolution” from  , with the 23-year-old Collier taking the Trane down the scale during his fine solo. But it’s the more overtly spiritual jazz songs that resonate the longest. “We’ll Get Through This” leans into   and wood blocks for a sparse mix limned with the blues, at once mournful and resolute—especially as the horns hold sway, and Wilkes cuts loose with arching, aching, extended notes. “Time IS” adds more complexity and a trifle more dissonance to the layers of rhythm without sacrificing its spiritual vibe. And the closer, a cover of the classic “Summertime,” derives its initial ambiance from spirit bowls and humming before the sax and more traditional percussion step up. It is the shortest song on the album, and it ends mid-phrase, suggesting there is still a long way to go before the healing is complete.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kahil-elzabar-a-time-for-healing-review"}

Described by drummer Mike Alfieri as a vision of a “sustainable paradise,”   acts as both manifesto and speculative fiction: verdant world-building via psychedelic rock. Formed in 2019, Tomato Flower’s sound is an accessible escape from its members’s solo ventures. Austyn Wohlers, who plays guitar and handles half of the vocal duties on the record, is working on a novel and crafts meditative ambient compositions as   with fellow singer/guitarist Jamison Murphy. Much of the aforementioned Alfieri’s past work was in the free jazz tradition. Despite the band’s headier interests, their combined creative efforts produce soft-rock songs that immediately click. They sparkle on the surface, glistening with reverberated dew and jazz-adjacent melodies ripe with feeling, but there are also plenty of weirder, camouflaged eccentricities to chew on if that’s your thing. Shuffling to a laid-back lounge rhythm and tropical keys that harken back to the age of  , lead single “Red Machine” is an ode to mass production and delicious produce. Murphy paints abstract images of colossal tractors and summer harvests — and maybe collectivist ideology, depending on your taste for metaphor  dares to get utopian at a time when pessimism is en vogue. As the cover art suggests, Tomato Flower’s idea of paradise is an urban Eden, where the city streets are lined with vegetation. The middle of the EP is home to the band’s more experimental excursions, like “Stone,” which toys with rhythm before landing on a jittery math rock groove. “Truth Lounge” even eschews their usual pop disposition to explore dissonant, spooky timbres. The sinister atmosphere is only broken up by a single, sci-fi-inspired synth tone that feels like a hilarious beacon of hope. Exuding the jazzy warmth of bands like   and  , Tomato Flower have dreamed up a miniature biodome all their own.

Such is the case with British singer/songwriter  , who allies himself with freaky Finland pranksters   for  . Dawson’s been delivering his weird-uncle missives from the UK avant-folk underground since 2005, mostly framing his eccentric observations with Cubist acoustic guitar accompaniment, like an unplugged Captain Beefheart with a Kingsley Amis preoccupation. He tried out some rock band arrangements on his previous album,  , but   (loosely, Finnish for “spirit”), is a full-on collaboration between Dawson and Circle. Their chief commonality seems to be a passion for messing with people’s heads. The whimsical Finns currently call themselves a metal band, but their twisty history includes everything from psychedelia to electro-experimentalism, and they don’t confine themselves to headbanging here. Circle works up an ominous art-rock waltz on “Cooksonia,” where Dawson gives a first-person account of the life of Australian botanist Isabel Clifton Cookson, for whom the extinct plant of the song’s title is named. The singer’s sandpapery tone and freewheeling phrasing suggest Robert Wyatt smoking a blunt while poring over a biology encyclopedia. The band works its way up to a Judas Priest-worthy frenzy on tracks like “Methuselah” while Dawson sings of geographic researcher Donald Currey’s 1960s work with bristlecone pines. But across  , Circle dips into pulsing, sequencer-friendly post-rock (“Silene”), a Neu-indebted krautrock feel (“Silphium”), and more. And as eccentric as the subjects may seem, Dawson manages to make it all grist for his potent poetic mill. Whatever the musical mode, the band mostly locks Dawson into relatively conventional structures and rhythms—a drastic change from earlier albums where the band-less troubadour was free to wander unfettered. Add in the prevalence of crashing power chords and   has Dawson punching in a whole new weight class.", "genre": ["Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/richard-dawson-circle-henki-review"}

Sturino turned 30 during the pandemic, and her lyrics are fixated on the shifting sense of self that so often comes with hitting that milestone. She reevaluates toxic friendships (“Everything Is Better”), questions her chosen life path (“Quitter”), wrestles with apathy (“Tunnels”), and reflects on past mistakes (“25th”). “Honestly, I’ve just been working/ Trying to find something important I won’t fuck up for myself,” she sings on the album’s dramatic closing track, “Point of Interest.” Her exquisitely crafted indie rock sure feels like that something. Weakened Friends are devoted to the blown-out yet tuneful side of ’90s alt-rock. On  , they augment loud/soft dynamics with squiggles of expressionistic lead guitar and huge, sugary hooks. They have clear antecedents in bands like Veruca Salt, the Breeders, and  , whose J. Mascis lent a towering guitar solo to their  . Nirvana’s shadow also looms large—the “hey, wait” that opens the chorus of “Quitter” feels like a deliberate nod to “Heart-Shaped Box.” Sturino’s voice even occasionally recalls Alanis Morrissette’s, another idiosyncratic singer whose pitchy yelping and penchant for sucking in breath mid-lyric belied her astonishing power and control. It’s the vividness of Weakened Friends’ music that distinguishes them from the glut of current bands playing ’90s-inspired indie. The cutting specificity of Sturino’s lyrics is matched by the laser-guided precision of the hooks she uses to deliver them, and the crisp, full-bodied production job by bassist Annie Hoffman renders the songs in vibrant color. Anyone who still uses the term “college rock” is likely to connect with  , but the uninitiated should find just as much to love.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/weakened-friends-quitter-review"}

On the cover of her new album  , Le Bon appears in a structured headdress similar to a wimple, last en vogue circa the 14th century. Throughout the promotional campaign for 2019’s  , she repeatedly discussed the intricacies of the Bauhaus-style chair she designed and built to accompany the record. Her songwriting and guitar work has been defined by its uncanny dislocation from traditional categories for years; she’s psych, she’s arty, she’s post-punk, she’s minimalist, then she’s all and none of the above, depending on the day and the record. Mentions of Le Bon typically come prepackaged in a short, near-unchanging list of adjectives: “absurd,” “surreal,” “experimental.”   is all of these things in places, and only not quite in others. Her trademark weirdo streak feels, at least by her metrics, almost subdued here, splitting focus with a doggedly singular melodic cohesion—  she wanted “to make everything sound as though it had been made in the same day.” She succeeded. Again, that is to say her weirdo streak is subdued, never absent. Le Bon’s poetics of the absurd figure each time   imagery seesaws between the ephemeral and concrete. Amidst the womp-womp synth sludge and tinny rhythmic tap of “Remembering Me”: “I wore the heat like/ A hundred birthday cakes/ Under one sun.”   exists in “cities built on monumental rage” in a “season of ash” under a “peacock moon.” She’s always opaque, never dull.  gauzy synths and thickened basslines are decidedly earthen, and co-producer Samur Khouja’s commitment to hanging those basslines squarely in its middle gives the record an undeniable gravity. To counterbalance some of its weight, Le Bon shifts into a pop prance on “Harbour” and the New Wave-y “Moderation,” longtime collaborator Stella Mozgawa in tow to sandwich the groove right in between her bass drum and her high hat. The result is intriguing and irresistible. Le Bon’s uncompromising artistic streak, in play long before  , is precisely what makes this album’s distinct and unshakable artistic confidence so remarkable. If   was Le Bon’s ascent to the height of her powers, then   is her setting up camp at the summit.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/cate-le-bon-pompeii-review"}

Hiromi Moritani—before taking on the name  —flew to London to see the Sex Pistols play live in 1977 when she was 17, and was inspired to start her own punk band. “I realized this was not something you were supposed to watch,” she told   “It was something you were supposed to do.” Once back home in Japan, she wasted no time searching for bandmates, sticking up flyers in every music joint around Osaka. Through mutual friends Moritani was linked up with a girl that went by the name Bikke, who would become the guitarist for the newly minted group. They got their start playing covers of The Who and The Ramones at amateur  , but quickly decided to change course when they saw other bands playing the same songs. “I realized Aunt Sally couldn’t go on the same way,” Moritani said. She began writing her own material, holding fast to the punk spirit but forging an identity all her own on their 1979  , now back in print after nearly four decades. Anarchy in Osaka, as it turned out, wouldn’t resemble the UK variety very much. Aunt Sally’s sound is deceptively simple, but with a razor sharp edge. “Kagami” appropriates the American big band jazz standard “Heart and Soul,” but the groove is torn to shreds with Bikke’s high-pitched, buzzed-out guitar, sounding like a circular saw cranked up to max speed. Moritani’s low, singsongy vocal is nearly completely drowned out. “Sameta Kajiba De” is even more jarring, pairing a waltz-time melody with cavernous, echoey drumming and keyboards that shimmer like faint constellations. Here, Moritani’s voice bears more weight, each syllable carrying the gravity of its own punctuation mark. There’s even a  -adjacent dirge in “Loreley” that slowly ratchets up the anxiety, culminating in a hellish dismantling of the children’s nursery rhyme “Frère Jacques,” with Moritani wailing like a vengeful spirit. It’s a potent reminder that punk can be whatever the fuck you want it to be. “It was very important to me to release an album while the punk thing was still happening in London,” Moritani explained. The group’s genre-bending debut arrived in the spring of 1979, but Aunt Sally would flame out by the summer, having already served their purpose. “Shortly after Aunt Sally formed, The Pistols broke up, and by the time we released the album, the momentum was gone because for me punk was The Pistols.” Moritani may have stopped making punk music when she went solo and rebranded as Phew, but she never stopped being punk during her more than  , uncompromisingly going her own way and never following anyone else’s lead.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/aunt-sally-self-titled-review"}

Perhaps producer Bob Shad had that in mind when he decided to relaunch   in the early ‘70s. By that point, Shad was decades into his career, having started out in the 1940s working with jazz and blues artists and singers. By the early ‘60s, he had turned his attention to early rock ’n’ roll. When he founded Mainstream in 1964, Shad released early albums from future rock stars Ted Nugent and Janis Joplin (and even dabbled in the avant-garde and modern classical). “The horizons of the audience have definitely widened, and jazz is taking up a great deal of that slack,” Shad said in  . He had relaunched Mainstream with some of the jazz friends he had made over the decades, people like  ,  ,  , and  . But Shad was also hip enough to realize he needed a bit more funk in the mix, which   makes evident. Established artists and newcomers alike dip into R&B and soul on these tracks, while the backing bands lean heavily into rock and funk, creating some fascinating hybrids. Shad is the organizing principle here, but the comp also accentuates the tight backing players who make each groove pop with life. For Shad’s older artists, adding some funk to the bottom removed the dust that had gathered around their legacies, revitalizing them for a younger generation. There’s jazz queen Sarah Vaughn, some 25 years into her reign, belting a funky rendition of Marvin Gaye’s “Inner City Blues,” with the likes of Joe Pass and Earl Palmer swinging behind her. Trumpeter Blue Mitchell had made a career on Blue Note playing hard bop, before pivoting to jazz-funk. Tackling a hit like “Last Tango in Paris” might seem like an easy cash-in, but the swinging big band around him elevates the song. Even a relatively young player like tenor sax   soars across an extra chunky take on Sly Stone’s “Family Affair,” abetted by a foundational rhythm section of   and Mickey Roker. Beyond these funkified cover tunes, there’s plenty of exquisite little grace notes throughout, from  ’s electric piano curlicues around Johnny Coles’s “Betty’s Bossa” to the Parliament-esque chipmunk voices accentuating the come-ons on Prophecy’s “Betcha Can’t Guess My Sign” (one of two horoscope-related singles the group released that year). The set’s true gem is  ’s “Quiet Afternoon.” Taken from one of fusion’s most unsung early classics  , it features a group of heavyweight players who would soon be powering classics from Herbie Hancock’s Mwandishi band, Miles Davis, and Return to Forever. As Buddy Terry toggles between soaring sax and ethereal flute lines, the band is both in the pocket and totally abstract, presenting a rare instance of funk that also moves you into a heady daydream.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-mainstream-funk-review"}

The record is more massive and textured than previous outings, aided by overdriven guitars and ominous synth pads that provide a lavish backdrop for songs like “AANNGIQ,” which features breathy throat singing in its crescendo. Known as  , this form of singing was suppressed by colonists and missionaries in the early 1900s who feared the art form to be satanic. According to  , Deer says it wasn’t until the latter half of the 20th century that the practice began to be performed publicly again, inspiring a surge of artists like   and   fusing throat singing with other genres in recent years. “We’re proud to be able to throat-sing because we almost lost this part of our heritage through colonization, and now we’re bringing it back,” she says. “We can do whatever we want with it, and wherever we want to.” Deer refers to her own music as “Inuindie,” incorporating elements of shoegaze, folk rock, and the post-punk revivalism of ’00s acts like Metric.

First founded by the Carthaginians, by 70 AD it was under the Roman Empire, before being usurped by Byzantine, Muslim, Catalan, and other powers, until ultimately falling under Spanish rule. But every summer, its beaches and clubs get raided by international revelers, and any history about Balearic music is generally overshadowed by the British DJs who exported that sound worldwide ( ,  , Danny Rampling). So on one hand, the compilation   is a fascinating set of rarely heard “Balearica”: stylish, effervescent, un-slottable, and deeply danceable. But it’s also a necessary corrective, an immersive 21-track set showing how Spanish speaking artists embodied the cosmopolitan spirit of the island without needing validation from tourists or off the island. Compiler/DJ Andres Astorga, aka Trujillo, dug exhaustively for album deep cuts, one-hit wonders, and leftfield remixes that shake off easy categorization, while embracing the island’s “anything goes” ethos. You’ll hear new age pipes, smooth jazz sax, the samba setting on old synths, Spanish guitar runs, robotic refrains, dripping rainforest samples, and pounding 808s, all in peculiar proportions. Ma Ritter’s “Flamenco Rap” is exactly that: a mash of furious strums, dewdrop synths, and a peculiar rap plunked right in the middle of it. Zas’s “I Love My Body” pairs self-love to a sensuous bass throb and laser pulses while Tango?’s own “Tango?” appears to answer its own question with an oddly dramatic slow-boogie number. Scan Man’s one-off “Arabian” wraps together electro, silky R&B, and hip-hop thanks to the timbre of a synth set to “oud.” It all builds to a sweaty house number like “Tabu (Caribbean Dub),” which captures in sound what an Ibiza vacation feels like: languid daydreams melting into nights lost in rapture on the dancefloor.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-ritmo-fantasia-balearic-spanish-synth-pop-boogie-and-house-1982-1992"}

Yes, the hotel chain. An executive caught Sete one night and was so entranced by the beauty and intricacy of his playing that he insisted the guitarist tour the United States, playing their hotel bars. Rio-born Sete left Brazil in 1959, never to return, soon connecting with the likes of  , Vince Guraldi, Lalo Schifrin, and earning fans like Carlos Santana,  , and   along the way. Making fans out of six-string gods in folk, rock, and New Age seems curious, but such was Sete’s skillset, taking from his native Brazil and his African ancestry, drawing on American jazz and European classical. This  —capturing three crackling nights of Sete and his trio in performance at Seattle’s popular club   (venue for another   released earlier this year) across 10-month intervals spanning December 1966 through the summer of ‘68—shows how Sete amalgamated these sounds into something singular, with nods to flamenco, blues, and more along the way. The heyday of bossa nova, samba, and all things Brazilian epitomizing exotic sophistication and cool in the U.S. may have been on the wane by the time of the trio’s 1966 set, but you’d never know judging by the daredevil speeds with which the trio approaches  ’s “Meditação” or “Garota de Ipanema.” Sete’s music could emulate the ocean: Luminous and hypnotic on the surface, with unfathomable depth the further down you dive. He finds ample space amid an expansive eight-minute version of Ellington’s “Satin Doll” from 1967 and conveys elegance, contemplativeness, and glee alike on Bach’s “Partita in E Major.” That tumult of feelings occurs often on this set, astonished by the flurry of notes one moment, looking out on an untouched vista the next. As Fahey once wrote about the man: “Bola’s music comes from a time long gone, when people were closer to themselves, God, and each other.” But 55-plus years on, Sete sounds even more like a distant future.", "genre": ["World"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/bola-sete-samba-in-seattle-live-at-the-penthouse-review"}

And certainly a  of artists went introspective during COVID-19 lockdown. This isn’t just a reactive, short-term trend, though—it’s the culmination of a steady upswing that’s been happening in the hinterlands between multiple scenes for the last decade. And Belgian producer   has been emblematic of these movements. On her  , SKY H1 expands the sound of her mid-‘10s EPs in all directions. Her most obvious musical connection has always been to the icy and rarefied “weightless grime” of London artists like  ,  , and  —indeed, Visionist was a key early supporter, releasing her tracks on his   offshoot CODE. That ultra minimal vibe is certainly present here, in the knife-sharpening sounds of “Silk,” the vertiginous euphoria of “Blade,” and “Labyrinth” which is as close to an extended shiver in audio form as it’s possible to get. Just as often, though, she joins dots towards other parts of electronic music history, and creates denser layers of sound. “Darklite” and “Topaz” sound very early-mid-‘90s—like a WARP   track and a   ambient dub groove, respectively—but made gothic with huge cathedral reverbs. “Freefall” and the single “Elysian Heights” do something similar to a techno pulse and rolling jungle breaks. But this isn’t being referential for its own sake: texture, space, and dark emotion are way more important here than any scene signifier.

With  , that convenience factor is diminishing, too. Stylistically,   covers the waterfront. Here is the growling electronica of “Mestre Candeia’s Denim Hat” and the psychedelic spookiness of “Slightly Before the Dawn.” Elsewhere is the field-holler-like “In Tongues and in Droves,” an interaction between Gay, trombonist Matthew Davis, and cellist  . It even has an interlude in which musicians Gira Dahnee and (frequent Gay collaborator)   perform what sounds like a step routine on “S’phisticated Lady” (no relation to Ellington’s song). Still, there’s a definite current running throughout the album: strong, danceable rhythms. The opening “Sometimes I Forget How Summer Looks on You” is a menacing pop song on its surface, but it has a churning polyrhythm underneath—complex, busy, yet with a contagious sense of movement. “Oh Great Be the Lake” has Native-American-flavored percussion; “Nyuzura” and “Lean Back Try Igbo” draw from East and West Africa, respectively. “Aunt Lola and the Quail” is a combination of all of it: organic and electronic percussion; tribal chants; cornet; Rob Frye’s flute; and strings. All of it makes the listener move differently, but all of it makes the listener  . The point, Gay says, is to engage with day-to-day routine and information overload as rhythmic concepts. (Even the electronic loops are meant to evoke the earth’s daily rotation.)   no doubt must be lived with a while to get the full effect. Still, it has a weird immediate power too. It’s as if the grooves at the album’s core counteract the strangeness and darkness that so often cloak them.

Parker is a part of Chicago’s jazz and improvised music community and a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), yet his playing on   is rife with certain folk music patterns and often sounds like acoustic plucking. At the same time, though, he casts himself in a sea of overdubs. Sometimes they’re just bass and comp lines (“Excess Success”); on the closing “La Jetée,” it’s   bass and comp lines, defying the listener to put one in the foreground. Other times, instead of competing ostinatos, Parker plays counterpoints that become tangled with each other (“Off Om”); at still others, he does long drones that sound uncannily like pedal point organ (“Four Folks,” “Flour of Fur”). It’s as mesmerizing as it sounds, and quite a bit more lyrical. Parker uses just enough choice musical morsels—sometimes offsetting them with effects or contrasting picking techniques—for the ear to grab onto and chase through the jumbles of sounds and ideas. Even if he sometimes yanks them away like a bullfighter’s cape (like the melody line whose sound cuts in and out on “Suffolk”). Yet, lest it seem as though he’s severing himself entirely from the jazz tradition, there are also two standards (“My Ideal” and “Ugly Beauty”), played in fairly conventional jazz guitar style and serving as anchors for Parker, the listener, and any curious passersby.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/jeff-parker-forfolks-review"}

But at the point where Fohr’s breath should dissipate, it instead bends, bleeds, and builds into an entire orchestra, rising to a screaming crescendo that introduces the crisp drums and sweeping strings of “Vanishing.” If previous Circuit Des Yeux albums allowed listeners to sink into them, “Vanishing” drops you in free fall alongside crashing drums and dive-bombing orchestration, as Fohr sings of “fading, falling, melting…” in soaring baritone. She’s described   as being inspired by experiences with PTSD, and the album’s most dizzying moments capture the disorienting, time-looping sensation of what can follow in the aftermath trauma. “Follow it around like a dog on a leash,” she intones on standout “Dogma” over clipped drums, feverish organ, and spiraling guitar, conveying a feeling that’s often painfully, terrifyingly ineffable. Fohr’s arrangements on   are staggering, opening, and contracting with total fluidity even across a single song. “Argument” recalls early Scott Walker in both its vocal delivery and orchestral flourishes, which shift like pressure points from majestic to mournful before arriving at a coda of acoustic guitar. Upon reaching the delicate strings and intermingling piano of the moving closer “Oracle Song,”   feels less like a simple expansion of Circuit Des Yeux and more like a culmination of all the different stages of Fohr’s career. “I think I’ve reached the point in my career where I want to make something bigger than myself and I have to rely on other people,” Fohr once   for 2015’s breakthrough  .

On sophomore album  , West’s approach was to start from within and look outward; she sought to make sense of a bout with addiction, feelings of insecurity, and the grief of a lost loved one by checking the temperature of her surroundings. By investigating the results of her decisions, the hope was to arrive at a conclusion about why she made those choices.   subverts that process, instead looking at snapshots of the self in a series of moments—an analysis of how West presents herself, and how that presentation might be perceived by someone else. “I want to look right into the camera,” West sings on opening track “Lava,” and it’s a potent metaphor; you can strike your best pose, but the picture that results is unpredictable. You’re at the mercy of how the light hits you, and how the photographer frames the shot.

Conceived while on tour and recorded between Los Angeles and Chicago, the album is a loving melange of tradition, spirituality, and odes to a Latinx diaspora in constant conflict. Dos Santos infuse musical proficiency with sober themes, like migration, on “Lejos de Ti” and the title track; narrating the broken embraces of loved ones left behind and the lonely exercise of sprouting roots in a new city. The barreling percussion and driving rhythm guitars of “Cages and Palaces” carry an even harsher message: “No hay salvación dentro de aquí” (“There is no salvation in here”). On the song, singer Alex Chavez astutely alludes to both the gilded cages undocumented immigrants exist within—in the heart of empire, but with restrictions and fear always looming—and the literal cages in which our government is still placing them. While Dos Santos are unafraid of taking challenging looks at the Latinx experience,   is far from a tale of woe. “A Shot in The Dark” opens the record on layered chants and a minimalist drum that harken to ancestral rituals tethering us to homelands not forgotten. The spaghetti western-influenced “Alma Cósmica” speaks of soulful transcendence over chicha guitars and hypnotic percussion certain to spark a thousand dance circles.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, she found some common ground between her spectral folk and the unsettling sagas examined on the show. Next thing you know, Nadler’s uncorked an album full of tunes based on some of those same mysteries that kept her company. Opener “Bessie, Did You Make It?,” for example, explores one of the many macabre theories about what become of married couple Glen and Bessie Hyde after disappearing from their Colorado River run in 1928, as it drifts between doomy goth-folk and something more lush and lissome. “Well Sometimes You Just Can’t Say” is inspired by the 1960s Alcatraz escapees who were never seen again after making a watery getaway in a makeshift raft, and the track’s shoegazey sprawl evokes the waves that rise repeatedly in Nadler’s haunted refrain. The album’s title track, a plush pillow of a tune, meditates on the fate of the notorious D.B.

One of the most influential DJs of the last decade, the Berlin-based producer’s legendary 2014 mixtape   introduced an expansive vision of ballroom and club music with sound design that could crush, cut, and obliterate, something  beautifully tied to themes of Queer identity, Black pride, and human perseverance. She told us she was bulletproof and reinforced it through songs that felt like explosions. On the startling and sensual  , Lotic finds strength in softness, resulting in her most confident work yet. Opener “Wet” wordlessly sets the tone of  , shifting the balance of beauty and brutality in  earlier work like osmosis. The first single “Emergency” luxuriates in flaring synths and shimmering melodies, as her falsetto stretches each syllable of the title into its own word, before landing on cause of alarm: “E-mer-gen-cy/ Please fuck me!” Songs burn with romance, like “Always You,” or grapple with heartbreak, like the  -influenced highlight “Come Unto Me,” and Lotic captures both with intense sensitivity, while her sharpest sonic sensibilities prickle under the surface like nerve endings.   never follows a simple trajectory from tragedy to triumph; instead, it shifts between the two in a way that feels more honest to actual life. The penultimate track “Oblivious” touches on self-doubt via heartrending vocals, while mid-album interlude “Changes” offers invigorating spoken word by Julius Errol Flynn culminating in the incredible exclamation: “It’s she! She’s the bitch you’re gagging for!” is a triumph, and Lotic appropriately leaves us with a song that seems to acknowledge it. After floating through such abyssal, fluorescent atmospheres, hearing “Diamond” is like encountering a giant squid, only to receive a loving, tender embrace. The longest song of her career at nearly nine minutes, “Diamond” feels gargantuan, as Lotic builds a metaphor about unspeakable pressure from vulnerable beginnings to an overwhelmingly cathartic climax that eclipses everything that came before it.

The coquettish “Can I Get Your Number” is set against a slinky musical backdrop, and sultry tracks like “Sunday ASAP” and “Never Die” have anxious undertones, while straight-ahead bangers like “Hey, Hey, Hey” and “Where Are You Think” showcase Hye Jin’s ability to keep the energy levels high. The melancholy final track “i jus wanna be happy” is full of chanting vocals and deep reverb, but it’s the hard-hitting rhythmic layers that propel the track and make it dynamic.

On the second installment of his series  , the Chicago rapper sounds comfortable in his skin, kicking characteristically loquacious rhymes, sounding so relaxed he could fall out of his chair.   might lack the rumble and hiss of his early music, but Common circa 2021 is making better rap than a middle-aged legend with nothing left to prove has any right to be making. Less interested these days in the boom-bap drums and heavy sampling of his most famous work, Common instead raps over an eclectic set of instrumentals that includes West African rhythms, Delta blues, and R&B. “When We Move” is one of the better rap-Afrobeat amalgamations in recent memory, as Common, Black Thought, and   (son of Fela) fluidly flow over choppy guitars and peppy percussion. The hooks also have a light touch, with singer PJ offering sultry choruses on five songs. Lyrically, Common eschews the news cycle for more eternal topics. On “Set It Free,” he exalts the importance of inner beauty; “Poetry” celebrates great Black thinkers, from Toni Morrison to Public Enemy. As ever, Common remains positive, remains a dreamer: “Imagine” borrows a title and a concept from John Lennon, picturing a world where water runs freely in Flint and Black people aren’t incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. “Since I was little, I had a big imagination,” he raps in a great voice.

The first half is drenched in darkness: “SS San Francisco” simmers slowly, with tense guitar riffs and grim vocals, before exploding into a sinister, punkish beat. “Smoke Don’t Clear,” a standout banger, uses complex drum patterns and hazy atmospherics to summon the feeling of a hot, smoked-out mosh pit.  is the final record to feature Injury Reserve member Stepa J.

Electric guitar and thundering drums quickly creep into the background before the track transitions to full-speed sonic madness. This bait and switch is a good parallel to Australian punk band Jalang’s general desire to invert and challenge the conventional. Frontperson Alda wields their strong knowledge of history to defang long-standing colonial and patriarchal narratives. Even the band’s recent name change (they were formerly  ) speaks to this defiance, reclaiming the Bahasa Indonesian word   means “wild, undomesticated” in a masculine context and “slut” in a feminine context. Jalang is here to buck your expectations. This unrelenting full-length does just that, packed with bright, sharp instrumentation, and deep, desperate vocals sung in Bahasa Indonesian and English. The lead single, “Cops N Klan,” opens with protesters chanting against the police at a 2020 Omnibus Law Protest in Indonesia, then launches into brutal, highly danceable thrash. The preceding track, “Lawan Dan Hancurkan,” similarly mixes protest sounds with the band’s own ferocity, gunshots punctuating the air like a sort of percussion.

Annika Henderson ( ) was a political journalist before she became a musician, and while her musings on the banality of evil in the Trump administration are not exactly original, they’re still more interesting than the #resist songs many artists of a certain age have churned out over the past few years. Even the album’s title track, a song with a saccharine message (essentially: people can change and learn from each other…and we should do that) doesn’t come off as cloying because it’s presented so elegantly. Back with her old collaborator   ( ), who co-produced the album and plays drums on every track, Anika creates welcoming synth worlds, perfect foils for her icy vocal style, while turns of phrase like “shouting around” push the lyrics out of generic territory. (Henderson gives interviews in a decidedly British accent, so it’s never been entirely clear whether her vaguely Germanic singing voice is an affect or a natural outgrowth of her German heritage and her many years spent living in Berlin.) As for the rest of the album, there are plenty of hits to offset the minor misses. Unusually, the middle third of the album is its strongest segment: The vocal acrobatics and propulsive rhythm section of “Naysayer” give way to an absolutely massive, droning synth on “Sand Witches,” underscoring monotone spoken word poetics à la  . Then, on “Never Coming Back”—the album’s catchiest track—that same synth is scaled back over traditional pop instrumentation while Anika sings about a lover she took for granted. Later, the Kim Gordon-channeling “Rights” dissolves into the synth-pop anthem “Freedom,” both of which avoid the direct political messaging their names belie. “Waiting For Something,” a slow-burning track with an acoustic feel, would fit more comfortably on an   record than an Anika album, but it closes the latest chapter in Henderson’s unorthodox musical journey with a graceful flourish nonetheless.", "genre": ["Pop", "synth pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/anika-change-review"}

King Woman is ostensibly a doom metal band, but even here, Esfandiari draws from a broader spectrum of aesthetic influences, utilizing the melody-heavy language of grunge, the shadowy aesthetics of goth, and the graceful spaciousness of dream-pop. Riffs and despair are at the heart of King Woman, but they don’t define it. Even when plumbing the depths of trauma, shame, and transgression, King Woman displays a level of immediacy and showmanship—and even a wry sense of humor—that’s less common in doom circles. King Woman’s second album   uses the Biblical allegory of Lucifer as a framing device for songs about her own harrowing personal metamorphosis. Esfandiari is depicted on the album’s cover as the fallen angel, showing her dorsal wounds and holding a smoldering cigarette with a leather glove. She even declaratively sings, “My name is Lucifer” on “Morning Star,” a bombastic slow-burn anthem that feels like an epic saga within its relatively brief four minutes. Where King Woman’s   delved heavily into Esfandiari’s traumatic childhood raised in a cult-like religion, she takes ownership of her heathenism, putting a more interesting spin on heavy music’s relationship with the devil on  . The demons here are all personal ones, with Esfandiari exploring toxic sexual obsession through songs like the visceral, ripping “Boghz” and the swirling psychedelia of “Psychic Wound.” But in a song like standout ass-kicker “Coil,” with its tom-tom-driven rumble and ferocious roar, the flames rise ever higher, solidifying King Woman’s transformation as lord of the underworld.", "genre": ["Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/king-woman-celestial-blues-review"}

It forces us to confront our innate and reflexive suspicion of goodness with no disclaimer. It exposes our cynicism. Most musicians don’t trade in it, at least not all the way. Performance is artifice by nature, pop is artifice on purpose, and everything is pop now, except for maybe rock, which hasn’t put up those kinds of numbers in decades (barring the ongoing pop-punk revival which, let’s be honest, feels like a government PSYOP). In modern life and in music, true sincerity is hard to find. Sonny Smith, the man behind longtime San Francisco outfit Sonny & the Sunsets, is one such disarmingly sincere artist. He likes pretty girls and forlorn cowboy stories, and writes songs like it. He does things like name his seventh record   and put a hand-drawn sunrise on the cover. He then fills it with sweetly strummed folksy country that blends ‘60s harmonic softness with enough twang and slide guitar to conjure images of the elders: Hank Williams, maybe a little Willie and Waylon on “I’m A Dog,” and above all, John Prine. This is a guy who means it. Though he does a decent Bob Dylan impression (heard best here on “Driftin”), lyrically, Smith’s closer to  ’s perceptive yet richly imaginative style. From “Just Hangin By Myself”: “There’s a guard at a crossing gate/ I float by on a different plane.” As evidenced by that line, Smith has not lost his whimsy. He deploys it with comparative restraint, however, considering the narrative galactic fantasy of 2013’s   and the kooky vignettes of 2015’s  . Still, there’s a talking horse in “Earl & His Girl,” a weirdo Western tale which opens with the kind of sneakily visceral observation that sticks: “His name was Earl/ You could tell by his girl/ That he liked to hit women.” Most of it is lighter fare. Take first single “Ring My Bell.” In pop parlance, the phrase “ring my bell” is one of those winking disco euphemisms that means what every winking disco euphemism means. But Smith is, rather unblinkingly, talking about actual doorbells that he’d rather people not press while his “curtains are drawn/ at the Mirage Hotel.” His delivery of the titular phrase is positively McCartney, another songwriter who never wrote a love song he didn’t mean.  is clever and very sweet and more than a little bit country. Here is Smith at arguably his most understated as a songwriter, yet he maintains an emotional directness that permeates every phrase, then lingers lightly afterwards. It has no use for cynicism. It’s disarming and a little unexpected.

By the time   was released in 1970, the tide had turned against Makeba. Following her increasingly forthright stance on Black liberation and her marriage to civil rights leader Kwame Toure (née Stokely Carmichael) in 1968, white audiences withdrew their support, the U.S. government cancelled her visa, and Reprise Records terminated her contract.   was her last album with the label, and marked her departure from the United States and a period of great change in her life. Produced by Lewis Merenstein, the album features soul covers of hits such as Van Morrison’s “Brand New Day” and “I Shall Sing,” alongside the percussion-driven “Down On The Corner,” originally by Creedence Clearwater Revival. But a more contemplative thread runs through the record, in tracks like Crosby, Stills & Nash’s “For What It’s Worth” and The Beatles’ “In My Life”—a reflection of the changes going on around her. Makeba’s original compositions tackle familiar themes: “Lumumba” honors both Congolese independence leader   and Miriam’s grandson, while the diverse influences on the funky “Ibande” and the powerful “Kulala” are reflective of Makeba’s Pan-African approach.

Translation, then, is an understandably tricky affair. And on their latest album 之 / OF, synesthetic sound artist Li Yilei attempts an even more difficult translation from poetry to music. Growing up with undiagnosed Asperger’s, Li is familiar with the tenuous relationship between language and meaning. In this new record, they have crafted 12 ambient tracks to represent 12 poems associated with each hour, musing on the effect that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on our understanding of time. Each track title is a singular Chinese character and its English transliteration; but without context, deciphering their meaning is sometimes a challenge. Some are clear references to nature: the stark drones and samples of cresting waves in “HAI / 海“ recalls the sheer vastness of the sea. Others are more abstract: “CHU / 處” could refer to a place of residence, or a punishment to be meted out. The track’s warm analog synth sequences might suggest the former instead of the latter. Linguistics aside, the sonic language that Li works with on this record is lovely to the ear, wrangling field recordings, synthesizers, guqin, and violin to evoke a wide range of emotions. There’s a pensive mystique to the polyrhythmic synths and erratic clicks in “YUN / 暈”, an ominous foreboding to the dissonant percussion and vocal samples discussing “spiritual terrorism” in “YAN / 言” . The album’s fragmentary titles are, in part, explained by a poem on its cover: “it is an unfinished tone, a broken sentence, a start and a whole.” On the bottom right in Chinese is “無休止”, which translates to “endless.” A cycle of 12 tracks as hours on a clock, “之 / OF” is a microcosm of the new normal and its attendant sounds and emotions.", "genre": ["Ambient"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/li-yilei-z-of-review"}

Every single album—the caustic noise rock of 2004’s   the icily electronic  ; their still indefinable 2006 masterpiece  is another opportunity to leave everything behind and start anew. That uncertainty has never felt stronger than in recent years when Liars became the solo moniker of frontman Angus Andrew following the departure of co-founder Aaron Hemphill in 2017. After cloistered sessions in the Australian bush resulted in two oblique, fragmented companion albums—2017’s   and 2018’s  —it felt like Liars’s next move would be to vanish altogether.

Lead single “Sekwar” rides a choked synth loop and disjointed drums recalling  , while Andrew introduces a muttering sing-speak fuming with anxiety and self-deprecating humor. The messily violent “Pulse To Ponder” outdoes the band’s entire 2014 album  , sounding more like ‘90s legends   than any of the ‘00s dance-punk bands so heavily influenced by them. It all adds up to a release as cathartic as a comeback and as exciting as a debut, a paradoxical reminder of how special this utterly strange band is.

The album is kickstarted by the shadowy “Grimey Connection,” an opening statement that brings together the heavyweight gravitas of Detroit ambassador  , Richmond representer  , and Massachusetts spitter  . The song’s slow menace and bluesy strands of electric guitar are perfectly paired to the trio’s steely threats.

They’ve traded the spastic art rock of 2019 debut EP   for something more focused and more sinister. As a result,   concerns—capitalism, for one, along with the hopelessness and false illusion of freedom it fosters—are more pressing and more direct. This is a record with real enemies, among them Big Pharma, chiefly for profiting off of the opioid epidemic. No wonder the tracklist is written in all caps. This is seemingly fragmented post-punk that never loses sight of its whole. Throughout  , N0V3L operates like a machine without hierarchy; a sax takes over the kinetic guitar line, that guitar twists into a new atonal harmony, and nothing is wasted. Meaty basslines are set so high in the mix that Joy Division comparisons feel inevitable. The agile guitar work that made   so enticing is back, but it’s meaner, punching holes in melodic cohesion or John Carpenter-style synth lines. There are moments of strange clarity, never better than on “STRANGER,” which opens with a simple and enticing piano riff before a scuzzy guitar takes it over. Moments later, the rhythm shudders into gear, and the machine is driving forward once again. Taken together, the record plays like a series of manifestos. There are no preambles and no footnotes, no truly cathartic crescendos offering a moment’s release (even in songs that stretch beyond the four-minute mark).   past is a darkened country, and its present, however intolerable, feels unnameable as it slips from grasp—“Grip on the present like sand between fingers,” intones frontman Jon Varley on album closer “NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE.” Varley believes there is no future—or maybe there is a future, but it is an indifferent one, and either way, late capitalism will drag us onward by our necks. His sense of time warps, stops, and becomes space, somehow even less tangible than before. In the final moments of standout “Apath,” it splinters completely: “Rushing, slow it down/ Closed off, open up/ Avoiding, look around/ Look back, seen enough.” That’s a brave statement to make on a debut album. Equally daring is the declaration that this is “violent and paranoid music for a violent and paranoid time,” delivered with a distorted growl over a splashing snare in the opening moments of “VIOLENT & PARANOID.” But N0V3L is the kind of band that isn’t afraid to spell it out—after all, the writing is already on the wall when it comes to the ravages of late capitalism. Toiling away from inside the concrete chambers of those dark Satanic mills, so to speak, N0V3L tests the mass of its own bleakness.

He played piano in a small health food store tucked into Laurel Canyon and lived under the first L in the Hollywood sign. Clad in white robes and sandals, subsisting on a diet of raw fruits and vegetables, with his long hair and beard, ahbez is today considered the first hippie. And when he penned a song called “Nature Boy,” it became the unlikeliest of standards—a   and since covered by everyone from Frank Sinatra and David Bowie to Celine Dion and Alex Chilton. Ahbez was a touchstone for the hippie generation, befriending the likes of Brian Wilson, Donovan, and Grace Slick. But ahbez released only one album in his lifetime: 1960’s obscure exotica album  . It was only when author and filmmaker Brian Chidester was researching ahbez’s papers in the Library of Congress for his forthcoming documentary  that he came upon a clutch of 22 compositions that ahbez had composed and copyrighted during a three-year period between 1960-1963. It was a low time for ahbez:   had sunk without a trace, and his wife was diagnosed with leukemia; the compositions Chidester found had gone unrecorded. So Chidester showed the sheet music to exotica devotees  , who set about piecing it all together into  . All of the words and music are by ahbez, with Ìxtahuele members Henrik Magnusson and Mattias Uneback meticulously arranging the pieces into widescreen exotica fantasias. The ensemble strikes a careful balance that pays loving homage to ahbez’s vision without falling into pastiche, creating music that evokes the titular utopian landscape. Dreamy group voices and guitars drift by on “The King and Queen of Waters,” marimbas and jungle ambience merge on “Manna,” with guest vocalist  providing wordless vocals reminiscent of another exotica legend, Yma Sumac. Certain musical motifs hint at “Nature Boy,” while “The Sandal-Maker” echoes that song’s main character, the lyrics mentioning “a carpenter…gentle and sweet as a dove/ Who knew all about love.” Most staggering is the multi-part suite “Scenes I-III,” where ahbez’s sheet music comes to life, woven together by Ìxtahuele into a 15-minute sonic voyage, an elegant mix of piano, hand percussion, vibraphone, and more. It would have been a classic during lounge music’s heyday, but it sounds just as timeless and transportive in the 21st century.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ixtahuele-dharmaland-review"}

The title track explores this idea head-on, linking an insatiable desire for forward movement (be it for travel, a tour, or “progress”) with extractive, pernicious cycles of idealistic exploration turned to depletion. Planet X could be our own or the next prospective placeholder on the horizon, and proves to be a rich metaphor for songwriter Emma Danner to play with. Across the record, Danner takes these big philosophical questions and makes them feel personal. “Weight of Man” centers on a clever play on words that contrasts the weight of existence with the physical presence (or absence) of a partner; “High” explores an intense longing that fringes on self-destructive; and tender album highlight “Hold” grapples with the transitory nature of life itself. A sense of melancholy looms over  , building upon the gothic Americana sound Red Ribbon debuted on 2018’s  . The difference this time around is the way the dusty guitars, wistful vocals, and eerie accompaniment evoke a very strong sense of place, namely the desert, which is reinforced by both the album art and music videos. It seems apt for Los Angeles-via-Seattle transplant Danner to summon the arid heat of the desert in the album’s sonic palette, not just because of her recent relocation, but because it’s a place that can be equally beautiful, lonely, and oppressive. Returning producer Randall Dunn, typically known for his work in metal, knows this world well, and helps bring it to life; though on   the arrangements sound a bit warmer and more on edge, the growling guitars and seething synths given ample room in the mix. It’s a great showcase for the talented supporting players assembled, including metal-adjacent multi-hyphenates like Monika Khot ( ) and  .

Calabrese kept leaving the band and rejoining just to leave again. Hardy stood in the storm alone.

The remastered  , too, sounds more living, flush with anxiety, indignance, and all its plumage; but it briefly lets out a gentle sigh with the achy “Heart Carl.” This acoustic track is the down coat over the remaster’s scraggly shoulders, though Hardy tries to divert from its softness just as she had done with her dick-joke-heavy stage banter. “I don’t care,” she sings, her voice nearly disappearing when she continues with “We don’t matter.” She shies from vulnerability, but not before making a sighing admission, “I never asked for this/ Does anyone ever ask for this?/ Just want somebody to reach out and kiss.” Both Giant Drag and its frontwoman are sometimes offensive, sometimes they perform energizing displays of steely human resilience.

All of this is made even more impressive by the fact that Guion is singing entirely in Latin, a detail you might miss until the jaw-dropping a capella “Sanctus.” The album ends with “Agnus Dei: Large Dance Acknowledging the Ephemerality of All Things”, a haunting epic built on one steadily chugging drum loop that feels like a shadowy reflection of  towering highlight “Evencycle.” It all gives   a sense of grace worthy of its spiritual ambitions, while also serving as an essential piece of MJ Guider’s catalog.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mj-guider-temporary-requiem-review"}

Taking on a grittier, noise-informed sound palette than his colleagues, Don Zilla’s debut album showcases a dramatic, future-goth side of the dancefloor spectrum.  builds on the fanged drum & bass and layered wall-of-noise laments from Zilla’s excellent   EP to develop a fully formed, novel sound that owes as much to harsh industrial aesthetics as it does to muscular dance workouts. Opener “Full Moon” sets the scene with a cluttering chaos of noise, musique concrète, and elastic beats set against dynamic drum patterns. “Automated” sends heartbeats racing with its seductive, ravey EBM drums and murky basslines, and the contorted melody and ghostly jungle accents are downright shiver-inducing. “Entambula” is perhaps the most unhinged track of the bunch, creating a dizzying, all-enveloping cocoon of pounding kick drums and chopped vocal samples. The moody “Bujingo” fully embraces the infernal, mashing together muffled screams, dial-up modem sounds, and aggressively panned synth detritus over slow and steady, larger-than-life bass. Zilla’s complex polyrhythms and kaleidoscopic song structures are highly evocative, providing fertile ground for crafting new mythologies. To me, they bring to mind holographic fight scenes from one of Samuel R.

Feeling burned out, she returned home to Louisiana, reclaiming her New Orleans roots and absorbing the music of the region into her songs on 2019’s  . That theme continues on  , where footwork, R&B, lush house, hard bounce percussion, and Detroit techno provide the backdrop to the story of an android named King Creole, and her journey through art, love, history, and the music industry. The album is broken up by samples of recorded interviews with Richards’ mother, who speaks about her history in New Orleans and her life as a Creole woman. These recordings lend added gravity to Richards’ narrative of struggle, perseverance and, ultimately, acceptance through love and art. Album opener “King Creole (Intro)” is a house number with rolling percussion, where Richards details a kind of mission statement for the album: “The blueprint is me,” she says, “I am the genre.” Both statements are true; Richards cycles through lush pop/R&B (“Boomerang”), techno (“Bussifame”), bounce (“Pilot [a lude]”), funk (“Voodoo [intermission]”), and classical piano with both confidence and ease. As its title implies,   is also an ode to New Orleans’ Black traditions; the second line is a group of musicians and dancers in a parade who improvise over the lead section’s rhythms. Anyone can join a second line, and the long parades that feature second line dancers are celebrations—honoring the life of someone who died, or commemorating a significant event. Here,  serves as a celebration of Richard’s rebirth; it’s an album that uses the travails of King Creole to tell a story of resilience on the way to creative and personal freedom.

For one thing, it’s a debut album called “Number One.” For another, it opens with “Gem,” a six-minute personal statement and absorbing descent into dark disco digitalism — depths the remainder of the record will spend mining. In the mylar-lined   for the song, Bezic haphazardly cycles through possible personae under her phone’s mirrored gaze: suited #girlboss, blue collar caricature, suburban mom with hair curlers, wannabe influencer in Adidas track pants and tiny glasses. “Honey I know that modern life is a drag/ But you can choose a you that never feels bad,” she promises herself beneath layers of sticky lip gloss and clumpy mascara. Internet-ified solipsism permeates everything; Jane Inc is ultimately performing selfhood for herself, and she simultaneously delineates and does away with the boundary between personhood and persona: “You’re the artist and I’m your greatest piece.” It can border on grotesque.   sense of glamour is akin, perhaps, to artist Marilyn Minter’s  . It’s maximalist and unwieldy; Bezic spends a not-insignificant amount of the album’s 30 minutes doing everything at once, firing off bizarre sounds and taking melodic detours across four lanes of synth-scuzz traffic. On “Steel,” she braids punchy neo-psych guitarwork into an anxiety-inducing “Work hard all day/ Work hard no play” chant. When she comes up for air on the sparser “Faceless, Bodiless,” she defers to Jane Fonda, sampling a line from the 1971 crime thriller   in which Fonda plays a call girl caught up in a missing persons case: “What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.” In other words, if you can’t perfect the performance, you can always disappear completely. As Jane Inc, Bezic flirts with anonymity through obfuscation rather than absence. Piles of synths regularly smudge the finer contours of her voice. Nevertheless Bezic seems to have a complicated relationship with her own disappearance. “My hands are filled with dirt/ I’m clawing at the earth,” she sings in “Dirt and the Earth,” the synth strain reminiscent of Charlotte Gainsbourg’s darker ventures. Yet on album finale (and standout) “Obliterated,” she cries out to God from beneath the “speeding wave of information” and its attendant pop flourish.

(Plans to film live performances in celebration of the reissue actually had to be rescheduled due to the chaos at the Capitol building.) Despite employing a host of unconventional instruments, there’s a bare quality to the songs—like trees exposed to an endless winter. The album was engineered by Christina Files (Swirlies,  ) in a large old building that used to be a factory, and that big, open space contributes to the record’s sense of barrenness. (The album’s intentionally out-of-tune piano, for example, was recorded in an empty elevator shaft.) Timony outlines her ambitions for the album in opening song “Dungeon Dance,” its lyrics detailing the experience of depression and the search for meaning from experience through art. In a way, it recalls Virginia Woolf, whose 1927 novel   is ultimately about its own creation—the author’s “attempt at something.” Like Woolf, Timony writes nakedly about her self-destructive tendencies: on “Painted Horses” she wishes the song would kill her, then confesses she would like to kill herself peacefully in “Valley of 1,000 Perfumes.” But even amidst the blackness of despair, Timony still seeks out the glow of creation, ultimately deciding that we must not “give [ourselves] away/ There are too many others in pain.” If   has a single unifying theme, it’s that we must stay alive for one another, and that we must   the meaning and connection we want from life. Not that creation is easy. In “The Hour Glass,” Timony wrestles with the struggle of working odd jobs while trying to survive as a touring musician. “This is the knife of life, work, and independence/ We are only free at night, but that is when we sleep.” The reissue is rounded out by new versions of four songs, which offer fresh shading and nuance. A new version of “Return to Pirates” reinforces the sense that Timony is moving towards victory over despair, singing, “I want to be in the garden of love/ Led by a lamb and a little white dove.” An orchestral version of “Valley of 1,000 Perfumes” is lush with string arrangements, and Timony’s voice is even more audible here when she insists, “Today our music doesn’t have enough style/ We’re going to run to the country from a suicide.” That line is a reminder of Timony’s prescience at the turn of the century as she sought out new ways to render both music   life meaningful again. When it was first released in 2000,   was either largely overlooked or actively derided by critics. Now, 20 years later, its influence can be traced in the many albums that followed (Sleater-Kinney’s psych-prog excursion   feels like it was directly inspired by Timony’s aesthetic sensibilities.) The album remains incredible and timeless: a place we can always return to that shows us how to survive the darkness, riding glimmers of light into the creation of new realities.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mary-timony-mountains-20th-anniversary-expanded-edition-review"}

Ross and Jenoure had been performing together in Northampton, Massachusetts, and with Wertman—a Queens native who cut his teeth in the New York City loft scene—they could’ve released something special. But one day before the session, Jenoure dropped out, which forced Ross and Wertman to find someone at the last minute to fill the third slot. Wertman called his friend, drummer  , to come up from New York and play the session. He agreed; New Life Trio was born. Recorded during a one-day session in December and released in 1979, the Trio’s first album,  , is a contemplative project blending American jazz with non-Western musical ideas. Where “Chinese Rock” feels delicate, veering between a sustained cadence and turbulent free jazz, “Egypt Rock” is led by what sounds like a Spanish acoustic guitar; Reed keeps a midtempo pace on the drum kit and Wertman bows the bass in its upper register. Throughout the album, the Trio adheres to the tenets of traditional jazz structures while leaning into the unforeseen twists that come with improvised music. While the band wrote compositions for  , there’s a sense they were looking for something else, something beyond what was on paper: for Ross, Wertman and Reid, the enlightenment arrived when the melody drifted into the unknown.  doesn’t live solely in the clouds, though. Opening track “Empty Streets” is about walking through Northampton as black sky fades to blue—or, as Ross says in the liner notes, nighttime is “galloping off and the day’s chasing it.” In turn, the arrangement has a nomadic spirit; the wordless chants (courtesy of Ross) convey the calm of rising sun. On “Sculpture,” Reid takes the lead; Ross and Wertman’s tenacious string plucks give way to the drummer’s methodical, blues-inspired tempo. New Life Trio was a short-lived project that disbanded shortly after  ’s release. All three members went on to have nice solo careers, which only heightened the intrigue surrounding this hard-to-find LP. Now reissued via  ,   sheds light on an unlikely jazz group that congealed out of necessity and made a grand impact nonetheless.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/new-life-visions-of-the-third-eye-review"}

Adusei, and a soon-to-be household name record producer, Frimpong Manso, met in an Accra music studio where some of the greatest Highlife musicians rose to stardom. Together, they created one of Ghana’s most versatile Highlife albums:  , a nostalgic record merging the sounds of the traditional pre-colonial musical style with the new swing of funk, pop, reggae, and synth influences sweeping the African continent. Highlife was so-named because it was   during colonial times, with guests at exclusive jazz clubs expected to wear formal dress to enjoy the Afro-Western tunes. It was reclaimed by the masses after Ghana’s 1957 independence from colonial rule in the “guitar band style,” where traditional string instruments like   were substituted with guitar to create unique Ghanaian sounds. On  , K. Adusei embodies that sound with a witty and melancholic ode to three of Highlife listeners’s favorite topics: faith, family, and money. The title track “Boafo ne Nyame,” meaning “God is a Helper,” is a slow reggae-funk-gospel ballad asking God to intervene in destructive human behaviors. In his conversational singing style, Adusei cries “As quickly as money falls into my hands, it burns away, so I’m begging God to extinguish this fire that follows me.” The cheerful beat of the drums, synthesizers, and guitar strings are a humorous parallel to the desperation of his lyrics. “Asem Da Ye So” (“Our Problems Are On Us”) is a fast-paced dance jam with deep funk and soul roots—heard in the guitar riffs—intermixed with disco themes and high-toned melodic backing vocals. The opening two-toned dum-dum of the drum followed by the melodic two-finger picking of the electric guitar is guaranteed to have filled many an Afro-and-bell-bottomed dance floor in its day. At eight minutes, it is the longest and most upbeat track on the album. In one of the bonus tracks “Abusua” (“Family”), Adusei brings back the funk and soul with a dash of pop. Asiedu sings, “The more money you have, the more family seems to come out of the woodwork.” That is the beauty of Highlife: funky rhythms and comedic lyrics hold a mirror up to society to reflect and do better.", "genre": ["World"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/star-lovers-boafo-ne-nyame-review"}

It’s a fitting opening scene for a record concerned not so much with the experience of loss itself, but the abiding presence of absence and the resulting magical thinking that attempts to will back that which has so effortlessly slipped away—to find, as the chorus of the song goes, the “words that stay.” Throughout  , Tele Novella (now a duo of Ribbons and multi-instrumentalist Jason Chronis) use finely detailed, often-cinematic imagery to conjure up the shape of what is gone: a shadow on the wall where a picture used to hang, a wishing shrine “devoted to a sinner/ Illuminated by candlelight,” a tale of a cold-eyed sorceress who feasts on crystals shaken down from a chandelier. “The heart seeks a story like the eye looks for a face,” sings Ribbons on delicate baroque-pop ballad “One Little Pearl,” drawing out a narrative by cataloguing things left behind: a bonnet, a diary, an old tooth. “One little pearl/ For the oyster’s autobiography,” offers up Ribbons in the song’s bereft denouement, her voice slightly quavering as she swoops into her higher register to deliver the line. The realm of the fantastic isn’t untrod territory for Tele Novella. Their 2016 debut,  , was an atmospheric ride through an eerie dreamworld, packed with symbolism and thick with tinkling xylophones, rainbow swaths of synthesized keys, and heavily-reverbed vocals. Though similarly flush with quirky, retro sounds like booming timpani, chiming bells, and the occasional fuzzed-out electric guitar, the psychedelic filigree has faded to a gentle pastel on  . Each song was written and recorded individually, in whole takes, giving them a sense of intricacy and spaciousness that foregrounds the ghostly melodies as they tumble out slowly over the patiently patchworked instrumentation. Tele Novella have also added a healthy dose of dusty mid-century country-western to their sonic paintbox. It’s an appropriately lovelorn genre with which to sift through the pieces of broken dreams from this side of the looking glass, but an element that lends their penchant for tarot card medievalism a whimsical anachronism, like an occult ritual performed in a horse barn or the spirit of   hanging around at the Renaissance Faire. Whimsy aside, by hitching their mystical wagon more deliberately to the three-dimensional world, Tele Novella’s music takes on a humane elegance that can be heartbreakingly tender, especially when the group lets the emotional cracks show. On the torchy “Desiree,” Ribbons summons the smoky ghost of Françoise Hardy as she darkly confesses, “I still believe that it’s just me/ You’d come back to living for/ For years I did not lock the door.” One song later she’s unleashing a crystalline howl of grief that seems to echo across the deserted hills of the band’s small-town-Texas stomping grounds, the final word that stays on a record that reveals how magic need not be a matter of imposing your desires on reality with crystals and candles since there’s nothing more magical than the resilience of one’s own humbled heart.", "genre": ["Rock", "indie pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/tele-novella-merlynn-belle-review"}

On albums like 2011’s   she stuck close to bare, stripped-down folk music, setting her rich alto against ripples of acoustic guitar. On each record that followed, she pushed a little more: her 2017   still foregrounded guitar, but added percussion and strings and piano for a fuller palette. Still, amidst the accoutrements, it was always easy to draw a line back to the folk music of her earliest days. The instrumental flourishes she added complemented the music, but didn’t necessarily transform it. All of that has changed on  , a powerhouse set of songs that feels like the album Lindeman has spent the last decade working toward. Musically, the mood is tense: woozy strings cut jagged lines across the center of “Robber,” icicle pianos on all sides, a trumpet fluttering desperately above. “Tried to Tell You” clings to a chugging krautrock beat, Lindeman’s voice gingerly leaping from note to note. Unlike her earlier work, on  , the guitar recedes almost entirely into the background, ceding the floor to piano and flute and organ in arrangements that are immaculately detailed. Its songs recall mid-period Destroyer, Talk Talk, and Scott Walker’s  , all of which exist in serene musical environments but lean into their more counterintuitive aspects. The vocal melody on “Parking Lot” is gentle, insistent, and immediate, but Lindeman pushes a pulsing piano figure to the fore again and again, deliberately disturbing the placid waters. On first pass the songs feel soft and welcoming, but there is an undercurrent of darkness that courses beneath all of them. With good reason. Lyrically, Lindeman   the album deals with the catastrophes wrought by climate change, and while such topical subject matter could derail a lesser writer into strident sloganeering, the lyrics on   remain beautifully opaque. “‘My God,’ I thought, ‘What a sunset,’” Lindeman sings in “Atlantic,” then follows with, “blood red floods the Atlantic.” The songs are full of images of birds and sunlight and mountains, but they could just as easily signal existential concerns as environmental ones. In the somber piano ballad “Subdivisions,” she draws a parallel between romantic turmoil and the highway during a snowstorm, singing, “The road was overwhelmed with snow/ Piled high in all the ditches/ I drove as though I did not/ Understand all the divisions/ …a narrow band of ice that stretched across/ The disappearance of the central plan.” She writes in vivid, poetic koans throughout   packing short lines with images rich in detail.

The entire song feels like a party, topped off by   sliding in to deliver an understated and perfectly constructed verse. The enjoyable “www” tucks a sly critique of modern conveniences and technology into a fun and breezy pop-soul tune. The chorus is bittersweet and sarcastic: “WiFi, I know that it’s changed my life for good/ I know that must be true/ What more can I do?” Painted in bold color, anchored by head-bopping grooves and augmented with jazzy flourishes, all of the tracks on  are elite. From the minimal electronic groove of “Please” to the way that “The Kingdom”’s melancholy chords give way to a swell of strings only for the piano to return for a heartbreaking coda,   is a beautifully executed statement that further proves that soul music is thriving in 2020.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/seba-kaapstad-konke-review"}

Next-to-nothing is known about the musicians involved in the group, but none of that matters—they’ve already released four critically acclaimed records, two of which came out within 12 weeks of each other. In June of this year they released the double album  a collection of soul, funk, spoken word, and drill chants focused on honoring the Black experience in all of its beautiful, diverse glory. But behind the beauty,  was also a militant record full of sorrow, awareness, and fierce indictments of the injustice and violence that Black people suffer on a daily basis, specifically in the United States. That the record was released on Juneteenth was no coincidence: its songs felt like a direct reaction to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless other African-Americans killed at the hands of the police. Where  was a tale of resistance, SAULT’s latest release  is a cautious celebration, an album that works overtime to heal wounds and lift up Black lives and Black culture. The spirit of the entire record is summarized in the final lyrics of the funk and Brazilian batucada song “The Beginning & The End”: “We shall reclaim our joy/ We shall remuster our strength/ Through millennia bathed in the tears of a thousand ancestors/ We shall rise/ As it was in the beginning, so too it shall be in the end.” That this joy and resilience is claimed through a decidedly dancefloor-oriented record is deliberate; music and dance have been an act of defiance and resistance throughout the Black diaspora. Songs like the disco and ‘70s funk banger, “Fearless;” the standout dub, funk, and synth track “I Just Want to Dance;” and the Motown-ish “Street Fighter” are calls to action disguised as party jams, inspiring fearlessness in spite of systemic oppression. The album is masterclass in how to fuse the spoken word and musical traditions of Black communities around the globe into a single potent narrative. More importantly, it’s an album full of compelling tales of resistance passed down, with love and urgency, to fuel the fight for Black lives.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/sault-untitled-rise-review"}

His first two albums,  and  cemented his status as a neo-soul and R&B artist unafraid to incorporate lifelong musical influences like cumbia, hip-hop, and French classical music into his compositions. These influences made for a cinematic sound all his own, a vehicle for Garzón-Montano to put the vulnerable tenderness of his voice and his lyrics on display. His latest record,  reveals a new, playful, and experimental side to Garzón-Montano; where seemingly dissonant classical piano melodies and strings pave the way for Latin trap and reggaeton-flavored bangers meant to ignite the dancefloor. In an album where stark sonic contrasts reign at every turn, it is Garzón-Montano’s soulful approach that makes this album a must listen. The album opens with “Tombs,” a track featuring an ominous piano and a tinkering marimba underscoring Garzón-Montano’s nostalgic, raspy croon. A song about mourning the death of a relationship, “Tombs” evolves into a composition with violins and strings in crescendo, and a wailing electric guitar—indicative of the turmoil that Garzón-Montano wants us to experience. The discordant, classical strings and pianos run throughout the record, creating a breathlessly beautiful rollercoaster of emotions where Garzón-Montano explores feelings of loss, grief, and the endings of nature’s cycles.  ’s wildcards come in the form of “Muñeca,” “Mira My Look,” and the title track “Agüita.” These three songs have Garzón-Montano entering Latin trap and reggaeton territory, and abandoning his soulful notes for rough, staccato rhyming. Performing in Spanish for the first time on record, Garzón-Montano takes us out of the melancholic fantasy world he created for  and thrusts us back into the disorienting urban landscapes some of us call home.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/gabriel-garzon-montano-aguita-review"}

From the jazz boom of the post-war era, to the electrified blues of the ‘50s, to the city’s rich soul music scene, house, hip-hop, and beyond, Chicago has not only long been a hotbed of musical creativity—the city’s history of Black music exists in a long, interconnected continuum.

Positioning the bright, melodic instrumental sample with a repeated voice that warns us “Shit just ain’t safe no more,” the tune is equal parts uplifting and downtrodden. For all of its impossibly heavy bass and complex rhythms, which fly by at footwork-standard 160-plus bpm,   shines with chopped-up melodies and poignant vocals.

A glorious maelstrom of almost devotional free-expressionism, the album found a new audience thanks to a 2018 reissue. A reunion must have seemed natural—and the result a scorching success. With Braufman and Cooper-Moore now joined by James Brandon Lewis (tenor saxophone), Ken Filiano (bass), and Andrew Drury (drums),   plays out over the course of two vinyl-side-long, spiritually charged suites (with “City Nights” serving as a funkier coda). Braufman’s anthemic, uplifting, and exultant compositions provide the players with opportunities for wild counterarguments. “Sunrise,” “Home,” and “Creation” build on the tradition of John Coltrane and Don Cherry, and “No Floor No Ceiling” is a scorching blast of Ornette Coleman-esque id-bop. The title track packs an indomitable sense of brotherhood, while “Alone Again” reflects youthful exuberance with distant proto-rock echoes (Braufman toured with Psychedelic Furs during the ’80s). Having emerged from Braufman and Cooper-Moore’s long-time, long-distance friendship,  ‘s organic formality is downright inspiring. Braufman plays with passion, and Cooper-Moore’s endlessly inventive gambols demand repeated listens.

{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0020098033_2.jpg", "album": "Total Freedom", "artist": "Kathleen Edwards", "description": "Longtime fans of Kathleen Edwards can appreciate the dark humor in the fact that the Canadian country songwriter decided to stage a comeback the same year the whole world shut down indefinitely. Her entire career—to say nothing of the characters in her songs—has been characterized by this kind of bum luck. The one-two punch of her stunning 2002 debut   and its 2004 follow-up   announced Edwards as someone who could write about people shoved to society’s margins with both compassion and precision. “Six O’Clock News,”  s opening track, told the story of a standoff between the police and a man holed up with a gun in a second story apartment with such detail you could practically smell the sweat and gunpowder. When she wrote about herself, that fatalism took on a wry, self-effacing edge; “Write a hit so I can talk you up,” she once sang to a mythical rock star boyfriend, “No one likes a girl who won’t sober up.” The knowing title of that track is Edwards’ career in a nutshell: “One More Song the Radio Won’t Like.” She kept that combination of caustic wit, narrative acuity, and scalding gallows humor going through three records, each as strong as the last, each ultimately just clearing the brush for similarly minded artists like Miranda Lambert and Ashley Monroe to storm through. Each new Edwards LP met with the same commercial indifference. So, like any sensible artist, she changed tactics: In 2011 she released  , which was produced by then-boyfriend Justin Vernon and which traded barbed humor and cutting country riffs for soft-focus pop songs that focused more explicitly on matters of the heart. The public shrugged, and the album came and went; seven years later, another country songwriter pulled the exact same maneuver, except this time the album was called   and it ended up in the upper regions of most of the year’s Top 10 Lists and scored an Album of the Year Grammy. For die-hard Edwards fans, it was hard  to feel like there was some kind of perverse cosmic conspiracy keeping one of the world’s greatest songwriters sidelined. And so when she finally ditched the whole bag in 2014 to open a coffee shop in her hometown of Ottawa—hilariously named “Quitters”—who could blame her? In an  , she said she couldn’t imagine returning to music. Now, five years after that interview, she has, and her comeback album   contains some of her most inward-looking work to date; its muted, watercolor pop sound feels perfectly designed for long days spent indoors. On  , Edwards takes stock of her life, presenting her findings with sensitivity and, occasionally, self-deprecation. The tone is set from the get-go with “Glenfern,” a genuinely sweet thank-you note from Edwards to her ex-husband and former bandmate Colin Cripps that expresses gratitude for the years they spent together while also getting in a few jabs at the music industry: “Now when I find myself looking back, I think of all the cool shit that happened,” Edwards sings, “Like, we had a tour bus with a bed in the back/ We bought a rock and roll dream—and it was total crap.” On “Simple Math,” a tender ode to lifelong friendship, she marks the passage of time in generations: “Building forts in cedar trees/ Ice cream, banana seats/ Everything and nothing changes/ And now we are our mothers’ age.” “Who Rescued Who” is a big-hearted love song to Edwards’ rescue dog, and on “Options Open,” over a gleaming slide-guitar hook, Edwards smirks at her own persistent singlehood (“For 39 years, I’ve been keeping my options open”). Flashes of the old Edwards cutting wit turn up—particularly on “Fool’s Ride,” where she thoroughly dismantles a terrible ex-boyfriend (the umpteenth warning sign becomes, “A red flag flying in a shit parade”). But overall, the Edwards on   is more reflective; the instruments are treated so that they become bands of sound that stretch softly across the backdrop of the songs, making for music that is more textural than the gravel-road Americana of her early work. The quietly crushing “Ashes to Ashes” is just a few whispers of acoustic guitar and cottony atmospherics; “Hard on Everyone” adopts a War on Drugs-y chug, the guitars as liquid and shapeless as rain on a windowpane. What comes through more than anything on   is the sound of contentment. There was a kind of urgency to Edwards’ early work that’s common to an artist who’s trying to claw their way into view. On  , defeat and bitterness has given way to wonder and wisdom. It is a record made to be attentively played, thoughtfully absorbed, and quietly considered. In that way, Edwards—at long last—is right on time.", "genre": ["Pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kathleen-edwards-total-freedom-review"}

Live albums, especially in jazz, are about removing that fourth wall—but most don’t swing the kind of wrecking ball that   does. Both Adjuah’s septet and their music are direct and undiluted on this mid-March night at New York’s Blue Note (the last before the pandemic closed the city down). Even the tenderest moments, like Lawrence Fields’ piano on “The Last Chieftain” and Elena Pinderhughes’ flute on “Diaspora,” have a startling urgency. Which means that the aggressive points—Adjuah and bassist Kris Funn’s echo-laden funk on “Guinnevere,” Alex Han’s screaming alto on “West of the West,” the warehouse worth of percussion that Weedie Braimah and Corey Fonville lay down on “I Own the Night”—are positively nuclear.   isn’t just about energy, though: it’s also about expressiveness. Adjuah’s music is about both the agony and the ecstasy of the African American experience, but in every case a streak of pathos runs through it. On this night, that streak feels like a runway for emotion to barrel down. The band didn’t know that they were playing the last concert, by them or anyone else, for the foreseeable future. They were aware of the pandemic, though (“We’re not running,” Adjuah says at the top of the set, “[but] wash your damn hands”), and it may have fueled the fire. COVID-19 and incompetence have since rebuilt the barrier between audience and performer, but   provides a sharp and needed jolt of the electricity waiting behind that wall.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/christian-scott-atunde-adjuah-axiom-review"}

The tone shifts with “Ode To Jazzman John Clarke,” a song that strikes a more somber, reverent note.  A striking tribute to the recently deceased British poet, the piece’s tremolo guitars, wordless vocals, and Morricone-style whistles give it a lonesome, Western feel. Idehen’s rich, textured voice fills out the sonic picture with spoken-sung declarations of rebirth and resilience. The piece revolves around Idehen’s devastating, repeated line: “I took my sorrow and I made a new hymn.” “All of The Lights” opens with DePlume playing long, fragile lines in isolation. Idehen soon joins, his voice twisted and pitch-shifted dramatically while Oscuchowska’s harp fills in the gaps. Like every other composition on the album, “All of The Lights” is bizarre and soul-stirring. Whatever Calabashed’s influences may be, they’ve certainly synthesized them into a unique whole.

With rare exceptions since their riotous late ’90s arrival on   they have perfectly balanced the paradoxical compulsions to be both a snarling indie rock band in love with angular guitars and noise, and to be a magnetic pop act with hooks that set quick and deep. The first half of their fifth live album— , borrowed from   that is woefully aspirational in these socially distanced times—is a summary reminder of their long-term achievements. Recorded during  , Deerhoof bound from 2007 to 2017 to 1997 in six songs. They grind through the early infectious powerhouse “Polly Bee” and churn out an excellent take on “I Will Spite Survive,” a Trump-era anthem about overcoming oppression that suggests   jubilantly covering Foreigner. The push-and-pull between Satomi Matsuzaki’s beguiling lead and the bruising rock band around her is perfect, the result of two decades teasing out this dynamic equilibrium. But it’s the last five songs—one-off collaborations with  , one of his generation’s great conceptual composers and trumpeters—that offer the best testimonials to Deerhoof’s flexibility. Smith immediately adds bright blasts to the funky strut of “Snoopy Waves,” then slips seamlessly with the band into a surrealist blues denouement. Smith howls during “Breakup Songs,” offering a jagged counterpart to the guitars’s aggression, and leads the way on “Last Fad” from noisy paroxysms to playful tangles and, finally, to what feels like a prayer for their time together. Perhaps this pairing seems strange. But for 20 glorious minutes, Smith and Deerhoof share the language of adventure that has defined their respective careers.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/deerhoof-wadada-leo-smith-to-be-surrounded-by-beautiful-curious-breathing-laughing-flesh-is-enough-review"}

Often, they evoke a sense of vastness.  the latest album from David Moore’s NYC ensemble project (which has been whittled down from 11 members to three since they began in the mid-‘00s), swaps the romantic piano figures of previous Bing & Ruth albums for the   farfisa organ. Joined by double bass player Jeff Ratner and clarinetist Jeremy Viner, Moore maps out an album inspired by his new love of long-distance running—“the trance of one foot in front of the other mirroring the endless, arid desert landscape,”   in the release notes. His mention of a specific environment is deliberate: The album was recorded in the West Texas desert, with no edits or overdubs. The record is driven by movement, and grounded in the notion of running as a way to feel small when surrounded by the great expanse of the world around you. The songs summon that sense of vastness. Droney opener “Body in a Room” feels like it’s flowing toward some unseen outpost, foggy organ unspooling like a spider’s web across a bay of whooshes and wails. “Badwater Psalm” carves out a high-arcing path toward transcendence with rich, sustained farfisa and resonant bass tones, while “The Pressure of this Water” commingles undulating organ with earthy, springing clarinet.

The crunching, bluesy riffs of the perils-of-stardom plaint “Twinkle Twinkle” and the airy Laurel Canyon twang of “Letting Me Down” are two high points, showcasing Price’s been-around-the-block vocals and her attraction to moody melodies. Produced by alt-Americana cohort Sturgill Simpson, it breathes in a way that lets you hear the air in the room, as plangent piano licks, sweetly surging organ, and a warm, comfy bed of acoustic/electric strumming set the tone for roots-rocking tales of betrayal, toxic relationships, and lessons learned from huge mistakes.

Or maybe you’ll spot the hypnotic sway of Boy George’s “Crying Game” in her warped Spaghetti Western six-string tone, again before she sighs its devastating first verse.  is O’Neil’s sad-eyed covers collection that doubles as an affectionate mixtape for her late brother, Brian, who died last year. Using a drum machine, simple electronics, and melancholic guitar, O’Neil revisits the songs of their shared adolescence from memory, rendering an emotionally complex portrait of the ways we carry songs with us as we age. O’Neil is not interested in faithful takes on the likes of Bananarama’s “Cruel Summer” or INXS’ “Don’t Change”—they are mere fodder for reflection, arrows between the innocence of youth and the experience of adulthood. She rearranges the former with the surreal delirium of a house of mirrors, doubling and tripling her voice beneath a rhythm section that suggests a gamelan band playing a few miles away. And she slow-walks the latter, bending those original four minutes of triumphant belief into a tragic seven-minute meditation on the frailties that make us mortal. Her 37-second melodica summary of Depeche Mode’s “Everything Counts” suggests the way she might idly hum it to herself. She adds a serrated solo to a 90-second snippet of Aztec Camera’s “Oblivious,” like a prospective teenage guitar hero fantasizing about standing beneath the bright lights of the stage someday. Released when O’Neil was already half a decade into her indie rock career, Cher’s “Believe” is an anachronism for this ’80s-anchored set. But O’Neil’s plaintive organ rendition epitomizes the premise of  : How we hear, internalize, and remember a song can be as important as how it actually sounds.

For two decades, from the late ’50s until the end of the ’70s, Collins was a star of the resurgent British folk scene, her voice as soft and strong as a single ray of sunshine cutting through dense fog. She was adventurous, collaborative, and scholarly, having accompanied   on foundational field-recording treks through the American South and returned to become one of England’s most vital links between past and present. But the trauma of a bitter divorce left her unable to sing, so,  , she retired from music for almost half a century. On  , her dramatic 2016 return, she favored folk standards of deceit, disappointment, and death. Babies were thrown overboard. A woman found her drowned lover only to die alongside him. Even “Old Johnny Buckle” turned his back on his wife to drink with the devil. A hum of existential anxiety again permeates  , the second album of Collins’ relaunched career. A steam-powered icebreaker gets trapped in the Arctic waters above Canada. A young lover mourns her beloved dead sailor. A pair of star-crossed, would-be lovers eternally join one another only in the graveyard. But on these 12 elegantly rendered songs—taken from the crowded pews of Alabama and the rugged hills of Arkansas, from the country spreads of England, and the archives of Collins’ own family—she offers visions of beauty and hope, her voice full of the kind of experience and nuance that foster trust. Even life on that icebound ship from “Locked in Ice,” which is “doomed to travel endlessly,” seems tolerable: “Where the ice goes, I go,” she sings with a calming sense of acceptance. Collins, who turned 85 this month, sings brightly of wishes for the new year during “The Christmas Song,” where the steel strings of an acoustic guitar chime like a parlor’s harpsichord. “Wondrous Love,” learned from the   of the Deep South, sees death as the conduit to eternal liberty, not an end; Ian Kearey’s slide guitar nods toward the Delta blues, acknowledging both the provenance and staying power of such spirituals. But there’s nothing more redemptive and affirming here than “Sweet Greens and Blues,” four verses written in 1965 by Collins’s first husband, Austin John Marshall, about their budding domesticity. Collins handed the words over to Kentucky guitarist and archivist   and asked him to write something new. His sparkling accompaniment is as open-hearted as Collins’s reflection here, parallel rivers gliding to the same unseen point on faith. “If we don’t make it this year, see what next year can bring,” she sings; though weary, it sounds as if she might be smiling. Right now, it’s a welcome bit of assuring wisdom.", "genre": ["Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/shirley-collins-hearts-ease"}

It’s also the guiding ethos behind the self-titled debut of the Toronto-based ensemble Pantayo. Named for another Filipino concept that roughly translates to “by us, for us,” the group plays kulintang, a gong-based form of music that’s been practiced by a number of indigenous peoples of southeast Asia for centuries, including the T’boli and the Maguindanao of what’s now known as the southern Philippines. The queer Filipina collective has experimented with kulintang since at least 2013, and   finds them at their most adventurous yet. The record’s eight tracks effortlessly convey the disorientation that results from holding many worlds in one hand, or in one album. The R&B-inspired “Eclipse” and “Divine” pulse with an erotic charge, contralto voices pondering what it means to be unraveled, imploring a lover to come with them before they run out of time, layered over ringing gongs, sensual bass riffs, and celestial synths. The first half of “Heto Na” incorporates gongs into a classic four-on-the-floor beat, a hypnotic combination that becomes an explosive dance anthem with the addition of a lively full drum kit and a collective chant that literally mandates that the listener hit the dancefloor with them and “own up to that funky shit,” drawing equally from queer house music and Filipino disco. Alongside joy and desire, there’s a concurrent underlying rage, made explicit in “V V V (They Lie),” which sounds like Carly Rae Jepsen if CRJ had generational trauma from centuries of colonialism, and the furious rap-punk of “Taranta.”  is a sampler of the sound of the Filipino diaspora, and a field guide to finding defiant happiness even (or especially) as the world burns.", "genre": ["Electronic", "experimental pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/pantayo-pantayo-review"}

From the triumphant opening rhythm—which pulses through a layer of misty synth like a beating heart beneath the skin—the album conducts experiments with texture and pacing, resulting in a series of tracks that as enthralling as they are invigorating. Throughout, the drum trio of Gomez “Djopipi” Henris, Sadrack “Mazaka Lakwa” Merzier, and Jean Rigaud Aimable layer complex patterns on top of one another, bringing each song to its energetic brink, then expertly reigning it back in again.

Each crew has a different sound: Isidore straddles darker and more traditional forms of jazz, while the Quartet covers deep cuts by Thelonious Monk and Charlie “Bird” Parker. Nature Work and Hearts & Minds are thicker blends of downbeat jazz and metal. In  , Stein plays alongside drummer Emerson Hunton and guitarist Ben Cruz, two younger musicians who studied at the prestigious Oberlin College and Conservatory, and moved to Chicago after they graduated. Their debut album,  , is technically free jazz; but as the album unfolds, it’s easy to hear a strong affinity for ‘70s rock bands like Led Zeppelin, and jazz-rock hybrids like the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Soft Machine. The songs begin delicately, often with one instrument, and gather steam as they go, rising to volcanic crescendos before settling into dense, mesmerizing grooves. On “Threadbare,” in particular, Stein opens the track by seemingly blowing into the clarinet without a reed which, when combined with Hunton’s irregular drum pattern and Cruz’s eerie guitar chords, generates feelings of pending doom. At the four-minute mark, the instrumentalists fall into a Latin rhythm that never quite syncs up; but the track thrives even if the timing is slightly off. Compare that with “24 Mesh Veils” and “Funny Thing Is”: Neither song really takes shape at all. The former slowly trudges along, carried by its murky mix of clarinet and guitar. The latter feels nimble, a hard bop track with light drum taps and bright chords that grow more frenetic by the minute. According to the album notes, the title track takes cues from The Dead C’s “ ,” the seething 22-minute opener of their 2013 LP,  . Where that song is linear, “Silver Dollar” is more nuanced, a like-minded update with buzzing guitar chords, raspy clarinet, and cascading drum fills. Threadbare’s track is damn near metal, but the arrangement is spacious enough that it still scans as jazz. Overall,  is a challenging, yet rewarding listen that’s fully indebted to experimental jazz and hard rock, and marries the two subgenres while landing on its own distinct sound.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/threadbare-silver-dollar-review"}

Her patient “Cello Constellations”—as one early track title describes them—float on waves of bowed strings. But Jensen’s work has a lot of other levels too, be they intellectual, thematic, or emotional. That’s more true than ever on her latest release,  the title of which reflects the record’s the deep conceptual underpinnings. Here, Jensen doesn’t just use recurring motifs, she grapples with the fundamental cycle of mortality.  The word “death” in the album title is not just a metaphor. Jensen wrote much of this album when her mother was dying of leukemia—a time filled with the repetition of errands, doctor visits, and the omnipresent bleats of hospital equipment. The latter influenced the hypnotic “Metastable,” in which Jensen’s cello swings gently between high and low pitches, slowly building intensity yet never wavering from its steady pulse. That intensity ratchets up in the drama of the next track, “Holy Mother.” Though the title of this massive piece is taken from the Tibetan name for the similarly-massive Mount Everest, it’s hard not to also hear in the track’s organ-like tones an elegy to Jensen’s own parents. Such layered themes are strengthened by the way Jensen returns to specific musical figures throughout  , especially in the album’s circular beginning and end. Opener “Daily” uses a simple chord progression that continually rises, and closer “Final” reiterates the phrase from tape loops that Jensen created in the studio—but only after she deliberately degraded them by crumpling and even stepping on them. The track’s murky feel slowly fades to reveal a pure, majestic version of Jensen’s theme. By ending where she began, Jensen offers both resolution and hope, suggesting that if death is bound to repeat, so too is life.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/clarice-jensen-the-experience-of-repetition-is-death-review"}

The opening track “Sheep Sheep, Don’t You Know The Road” is a gorgeous a cappella gospel piece; Jones takes the lead, providing a loosely swinging call that beckons the singers’ harmonious responses. “Let Me Fly” is a beautifully poetic song about finding salvation in the next life: “I have a sister in the promised land/ I never expect to stop until I shake her hand/ I’m not so particular about shaking her hand, I just wanna meet her in the promised land/ Lord, let me fly!” “Once There Was No Sun” is a rousing devotional meditation on the power of God and the glory of creation. Gospel music as an art form is primarily concerned with two modes of spiritual expression, devotion and salvation, and songs like ”You Better Mind,” “Plumb The Line,” and “Prayer” showcase Jones’s and the group’s ability to articulate the deep feeling of surrender and faith required for both.", "genre": ["Folk", "Gospel"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/bessie-jones-and-the-georgia-sea-island-singers-get-in-union-review"}

The album would be called   and its creation would be live-streamed. They invited a dozen guest emcees to join them in the studio—this was before strict “social distancing” measures had been imposed—conducted a marathon 11-hour recording session, spent the rest of the night mixing and mastering the record, and dropped the finished product the next day. Fittingly, the album’s cover depicts the elements that presumably were involved in its creation: a surgical mask, gloves, hand sanitizer, a pen, a rhyme book, a shot glass, and a dime bag. The album was recorded in Brooklyn, New York and most of the artists who make cameos are natives of the borough. The roster includes buzzing blue chips like  ,  , and Nems, alongside seasoned vets like   (Smif ’N Wessun), Lil Fame (M.O.P.), and  . The tone is set from the outset on “Pandemic,” where Term raps: “Living in scary times, prepare to die/ Mask on your face with your hands sanitized/ Silent cries from the rich, now they victimized/ Not a big surprise, hope you bitches fry/ Let’s not forget this whole nation was colonized/ Given diseases, rape, pillage, and skinned alive.” While not every song is that direct, references to the pandemic abound.

Can’t let it go to my head.” Musically, the songs are built on warm, melodic keyboard and piano loops, which Statik occasionally spikes with velvety vocal samples (the strongest example is the scat singing he layers throughout “This Too Shall Pass.”) The only track that departs from the album’s relaxed vibe is “Morphine,” which provides a jolt of energy via a chopped-up orchestral hit and the rowdy energy of M.O.P.’s Lil Fame. “I spit fire, y’all can’t deny it/ Y’all fold under pressure, I was taught to apply it/ Spazmatic, I spazz with it/ See that cloth that you cut from? I wouldn’t wipe my ass with it.” In these uncertain times, there is indeed comfort in the fact that not even shelter in place orders can stop Lil Fame’s boasting.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/statik-selektah-termanology-the-quarantine-review"}

Doom Trip has gone from a scrappy outlier to a respected name among cultists, with albums by  ,  , and   netting positive press in scene outlets like  , Dazed Digital, and   The   series, too, has gone from being an introductory handshake with an unknown label to a meticulous documentation of the growing experimental electronic scene.

By assembling a cast of characters whose music is defined—in many ways—by their unconventional approach to rhythm,   feels more physical than the chapters that preceded it. Nmesh’s “Cimcool 15KV Distribution” lays vocal snippets ripped from sci-fi films over a drum track that pirrups and rat-a-tats relentlessly—near the 2:30 mark, it approaches the kind of bass-heavy wallop the Bomb Squad would have lent to a classic Public Enemy record. Mukqs, the musical alias of   Max Allison, contributes a characteristically hectic piece, bouncing a high-pitched synth tone across a skull-splitting bass drum. Even Diamondstein and Sangam, whose work tends toward drifting ambiance, turn in a piece defined by its scrambling, nearly drum & bass, percussion track. There are moments of reprieve. Pale Spring, whose   was one of last year’s quiet delights, turns in the elegant torch song “Dripping,” and Pauline Lay’s album-closing “Mornings By the Sea,” where rippling keys float against empty air, has the tranquility of a closing prayer.

Some thought the announcement meant   was done making music (not so); others wondered how the change would impact his songs. The latter question is answered by  , the first album under the newly-minted moniker of R.A.P. Ferreira.

In usual Ferreira fashion, an epiphany arrives in the oddest of places: “One time, I was doo-dooing at a gas station and I read on the stall … ‘What’s the purpose of life?’ And someone had actually wrote back and said, ‘To be the eyes, the ears, and consciousness of the creator of the universe.’” The album’s concluding track, “Masterplan,” covers Pharoah Sanders’ classic 1969 song, “Creator Has a Master Plan,” breaking it down to its discernible bassline and backing flute (the latter courtesy of Aaron Shaw). Instead of fully mimicking experimental vocalist Leon Thomas (though Ferriera does yodel a bit near the middle of the track), he remembers when serenity wasn’t so scarce. “There was a time when peace was on the Earth,” he sings. “In my heart how I   for that spirit’s  .” As the song fades and the album ends, we hear a short burst of laughter from Ferriera and crew.

It’s an evolution from her work for  ; those abrasive and fragmented early releases are shredded into layers by the sounds of broken glass, bullets, and industrial machinery, speaking to the racism she witnessed and experienced as a young Black performance artist growing up in Cape Town, South Africa. Against that backdrop, the album’s themes of confidence and transfeminine empowerment are not just aspirational—they’re political. “I don’t see luxury as wealth,” she said in  .

The range displayed by the self-produced tracks shows the breadth of her talents. “Rewind” allows her regal voice to take center stage as snare and bass drum thud in the background, providing less structure than texture. On the other hand, “Golden” is a frothy big band fantasy, beginning with synthesized stabs of horn and a glamorous announcement: “Welcome to the Angel-Ho Band!

Like     looks to the ‘80s for inspiration, jettisoning the wiry, guitar-led post-punk that defined early outings like   and   in favor of big, sighing, robotic electronics that—tonally and texturally—land directly in line with albums like   and  . And while the mood occasionally brightens—I can’t prove it’s a one-to-one duplication, but the arpeggiated synth progression powering “Pearls” sounds an awful lot like “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”—  mostly operates at a kind of icy, android-like remove. The group nail their chosen touchstones with striking efficiency: the moody claustrophobia of “Gloves” creates a sense of dread with gurgling electronics and a processed-to-oblivion guitar line, while on “Crimes,” Lew cascades multiple ghostly vocal layers down a slick, frigid electronic plane. But for all of its expertly executed melodic machine-work, the album’s lyrical concerns are entirely human. The subject matter is right there in the title: the album was written while Lew was pregnant, and was grappling with both the dread and the joy of bringing a new life into the world. Lew mostly rejects taking a literal approach. The title track could be written from the perspective of her newborn son—“Mother will they hit the switch?” “Mother will they drop the bomb?”—but it could just as easily be Lew herself asking questions of Mother Earth (an interpretation that feels like less of a stretch when you look at the album cover, and hear Lew sing, “Mother, they’ve forgotten you”). Album-closer “Flat Earth” hints at a similar duality: about 40 seconds in, a synth pattern that sounds like a melody from the kind of musical mobile that typically hangs above a bassinet enters, as Lew softly sings about cyclical orbits and repeated routines—“It’s the same all over again/ Cross the same road/ put more air in the tires”—that are reassuring in their familiarity.

After The Birthday Party, Howard spent the next few decades collaborating with like-minded artists; playing in Crime and The City Solution, with Nikki Sudden’s band, and with his own band These Immortal Souls. He also made a number of extremely fine recordings  . In 1999, the Australian record label Shock, put out Howard’s first solo album,  . Twenty years later, it gets its first proper North American release via Fat Possum, as a double LP remastered by original producer Lindsay Gravina.

There’s a weight to the album, which proceeds as a uniformly mid-tempo dirge that might scan as affectation in lesser hands, particularly on covers of Billy Idol’s “White Wedding” and The Shangri-Las’ version of Jay and The Americans’ “She Cried.” Throughout, Howard’s singularly sharp riffs embroider each song’s fabric. On a few tracks, like the lovely “Exit Everything,” his guitar turns silvery in tone and becomes a bit more fluid, a mournful counterpoint to his vocal delivery. Howard would put out one more solo album: 2009’s misanthropically beautiful  , released two and a half months before he died of liver disease. But even if he hadn’t, even if he hadn’t written “Shivers” and so many stunning Birthday Party songs, Howard’s gift would be set in stone by  .

Both labels focus on careful crate-digging, and here they’ve chosen to exhume and compile rarities from the Swiss experimental, post-punk, and electronic scenes of the ‘80s and early ‘90s, that fertile time when more affordable commercially available synthesizers transformed home studios across the world. These artists all did remarkably different things with the tools they had at hand. There’s disorienting (yet a little jazzy) new age from Bells of Kyoto, which could be relaxing elevator music if it wasn’t constantly lurching about in syncopation, with elements appearing and disappearing in the mix as if the track was fading into and out of view. There’s catchy minimal wave with peculiar baby-voiced spoken-word verse from Carol Rich, and delightfully dated, molasses-slow synth-pop with orchestra hits and hilariously compressed slap bass from Air Project. Sky Bird, who sadly passed away while this project was being put together, offers an ominous, conspiratorial vocal over deceptively simple piano chording, MIDI horn blasts, searing, barely-there guitar and choppy drum machine. Kulu Hatah Mamnua’s track has a ritual patter to its percussion and wordless chanting, and folk tradition in its strings; Peter Philippe Weiss’ “Subway” is half-’80s disco pop, half-terrifying internal monologue. Each track feels like its own little world, and yet as a compilation, it makes a remarkable amount of sense—gentle oddballs working with a sense of possibility, without a real desire for mainstream understanding.

Born in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua in 1924, his professional career didn’t begin until the early 1950’s—first as part of Luis Alcaraz’s Latin swing orchestra, then with pianist Juan García Esquivel. In 1953, Contreras released his first solo album,  , a self-described tropical jazz LP reportedly inspired by a trip he’d taken to the Dominican Republic. In an era of bebop and big band, his sound was more psychedelic, a forward-looking mix of swing, waltz, and American avant-garde. Take a song like “ ,” for instance: With its slight drum taps, bleak organ chords, and brooding choral chants, the track feels funereal—like a portent of approaching doom, or the rising noise from scorched earth. Then there’s 1960’s “ ” with its pitch-black piano loop and extended drum solo predating Henry Mancini’s “Pink Panther Theme” or Marvin Gaye’s “Trouble Man.” In 1978, working with musical partner Estrella Newman under the group name Quinto Sol (Spanish for “Fifth Sun”), Contreras released   one of his boldest albums. The project—heavily influenced by the Aztec calendar—is based around the idea of the  , an object said to document the Earth’s transformation. The music here is equally probing, steeped in the sound of experimental jazz from Colombia and Mexico. But there are also hints of funk and New York-centric free jazz, which gives the music a strange yet familiar quality—like  -era Miles Davis soundtracking a stoner film. The album is being re-released on the newly-created   by cratedigger, DJ, and label owner Gilles Peterson, who first bought the record years ago in Japan. Some time later in Mexico, he was introduced to a fellow record collector named Carlos Icaza, who introduced him to Contreras. Together the three formalized a plan to reissue  . On the 10-minute opener “Sinfonia Del Quinto Sol,” the musicians blend ghostly strings, looping wind instruments, and operatic wails into a volatile arrangement that never quite stabilizes. The album’s other tracks, “El Hombre Cosmico” and “Orbita,” sound nearly identical in tempo and tone, until the latter briefly breaks down and the haunting harp chords from “Sinfonia Del Quinto Sol” return, bringing this quick EP (three tracks, twenty-one minutes) full circle.

Lyrically, the group was just as pointed, tackling the failure of capitalism, the rise of fascism, and the necessity of response on personal and global fronts. Their latest,  , produced by Randall Dunn and Uniform’s Ben Greenberg, opts for a slightly sleeker approach; the music here often feels more ruminative, but it’s no less committed to a fierce critique of the world’s corroded state. The cold electronics and goth/industrial elements of their earlier work remain crucial—which the album-opening title track makes clear from its opening notes—while the stark guitar on “Repeating Night” gives the song a beautifully gloomy feel. Franklin James Fisher’s fierce sing/shout vocal style gives the songs an immediate humanity, striking a balance between oration and a thoughtfulness. (The chorus of “Hour of the Furnaces”—“We all step into the fire”—makes for a thrilling, unnerving high point.) Drummer Matt Tong delivers an exquisite combination of analog and digital rhythms, while Fisher, Ryan Mahan, and Lee Tesche flesh out the arrangements using sharp bursts of guitar and thick bass. The end result are anthems like the ever more tightly winding “Chaka”—which includes one hell of a sax break—and the slow-burner “Dispossession,” which is punctuated by occasional  breaks from Fisher. Meanwhile songs like the piano-centered poison ballad “Losing Is Ours” and the high stakes “Nothing Bloomed” serve as both a reminder of—and a riposte to—the ever-growing sense of ominousness that has become a characteristic of our time.  ", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/algiers-there-is-no-year-review"}

That blueprint remains central to the nine songs that follow; En Attendant Ana fuse uptempo guitar lines that draw equally on ‘70s post-punk and classic indie pop à la   with lyrics about ditching your current circumstance in favor of finding something more fulfilling. On “Flesh or Blood,” over chopping, staccato guitars, and between baleful blasts of trumpet, Bouchaudon runs through a list of mishaps and miscommunications, coming to the same conclusion again and again: “That’s why I’m going away.” On “Do You Understand?” a moment of near silence stops the bounding guitars for a half second before Bouchaudon announces that she’s going to go for a ride to breathe again, and the pause seems to emphasize how badly she needs a break from the chaos.

A lifelong farmer, most of the songs on the album were composed by Frank while he worked the land. (An interview with his surviving relatives included in the album insert describes him riding a tractor, composing tunes.) Full of sweet, evocative vocal melodies sung in Swahili, and deft acoustic guitar playing from Frank, the music on  bridges Tanzanian pop, folk, and country blues. Opener “Mwanangu Lala” (“Sleep My Child”) is a beautiful lullaby that centers the voices of Thecia Clara and Maria Regina, while Frank’s masterful guitar playing flows between subtle background strumming and lead picking. “Kafo Mshiki” (“Hello, Girl”) highlights the smooth call-and-response vocal interplay between Frank and his sisters. On “Shida” (“Problems”), the band lament the trials of love lost with Thecia Clara and Maria Regina asking, “Why are you sad, brother Frankie? What is the problem?” Frank’s astute lead vocals and the sisters’ symbiotic harmonies make “Shida” a standout. The album closes with “Nakusalimu” (“I Am Greeting You”), a song brimming with kindness and familial affection. With a relaxed lead from Frank and sweet, sweeping harmonies from Thecia Clara and Maria Regina, the song is indicative of the trio’s endearing and wistful sound.

{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0015929466_2.jpg", "album": "Scis” and “Eksploio", "artist": "Oval", "description": "The music Markus Popp makes as   is in part about the act of listening. His tracks—“experimental” to be sure, but otherwise difficult to classify in terms of genre—are defined by how they focus attention, zooming in to assess the most minute detail of a sample one moment and zooming out to showcase the latticework construction of the whole the next. Popp forces the listener to think about how they process sonic information, but his work also happens to be inviting no matter what intellectual engagement one brings to it. The two newest Oval releases, the   EP and the album  , are the product of the ideas that have defined the project all along, but Popp continues to add new wrinkles. To understand how we got here, it helps to take a step back. Oval’s recorded output can be divided into several distinct phases. The project’s earliest work was decidedly ambient but with a discomfiting edge, as soothing hums and digital clicks and buzzes interrupted drones. Starting around the time of 1999’s   EP, Popp added noise and distortion, and the music became aggressive and overwhelming while keeping elements of conventional melodic beauty. After a long break from Oval in the 2000’s, Popp returned in 2010 with  , which found him inhabiting a world of clean tones that referenced recognizable instruments—even as his compositional structures remained wild and unpredictable.   and   are part of a more recent phase that finds Oval in a dreamier realm; Popp builds pieces from small fragments that he arranges for maximum emotional engagement, creating a kind of kaleidoscope of color in sound.  has an almost classical bearing, with bits of piano and orchestral sounds that lend drama. One can sense the hand of a composer; the random element, always present with Oval, sits more in the background. “Eksploio” has string-like synth parts, reminiscent of ‘90s chill rooms, and a rush of low-end energy that is recognizably percussive. It’s unusually musical for Oval. “Blissous” has a chattering series of taps sourced from the highest few keys on the piano, giving the twitchy and beat-heavy electronics a wooden earthiness. And “Brockaat” is among the most tuneful tracks Popp has created, with a simple two-note melodic refrain anchoring the piece and foregrounding glimmering trills of xylophone. If   is disarmingly pretty,  ’s defining characteristics are rhythm and noise. That push and pull of opposing forces, where the most delicate bits of melody—a sampled guitar, a shard of piano, a small fragment of voice—compete for space with a deep bass rumble that’s hard to pry apart, is the essence of the album. The opening “Twirror” is packed with distorted drones and squeaks that function almost like power chords, while a heavy quake of electronic percussion adds tension underneath. “Pushhh” features a chaotic series of drum hits driving the beat under noisy synths, but also has a traditional backbeat, something of a rarity in the Oval world; “Robussy” is another track with a hypnotically throbbing bottom octave. Beats are often out front on  , but Popp’s drum programming isn’t tied to any particular musical idiom. Though the music is tethered to a steady pulse, percussion, for Popp, is ultimately another tool for density and space. If this pair of records is an early glimpse at the next phase of Oval’s sound, it’s one with a lot of promise, as both channel his complicated methods into music of rare emotional force.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/oval-scis-and-eksploio"}

But on her new full-length debut,  , the musician, songwriter, and producer (born Brittney Denise Parks) takes her knack for sound manipulation to new heights. She creates a distinctly orchestral sound, layering violin and strummed guitar over choirs of her own voice, and incorporating digital clinks, rumbling bass, and quietly building synths. Working with producers like Washed Out, Paul White, and Rodaidh McDonald, on  , Parks luxuriates in a fuller, R&B and pop-influenced sound, using it as a backdrop to explore the concept of duality.  As an identical twin, duality is a subject that has long been in the back of Parks’s mind. On  , she tackles the concept with incisiveness. “He can make you stay/ He can make you go/ Now you’re stuck,” she sings on the dark interlude “Stuck.” Later, on the sonically brighter “Limitless,” she sings, “It’s OK to be afraid/ Feeling stuck, unlucky, OK/ You’re the only great escape.” This kind of call-and-response appears throughout the album, in lighter, more hopeful, songs like “Confessions” and moodier tracks like “Black Vivaldi Sonata” and “Green Eyes,” which tackle the haunting nature of relationships.

On album opener “A Little Spark,” a slick, mid-tempo soul number brimming with optimism, High advises: “Show the world a little spark, instead of getting used to the dark!” “Room At The Top” is a rock n’ soul jam that brings to mind   era Tina Turner, and “Face My New Future” opens with Morricone-style whistle before diving into a smoking, funk-rock groove.

Witness the number of early 2010s garage bands now putting out double LPs of thinky prog or synth-punk. Portland band the Shivas land solidly on the “punk” side of the garage spectrum on fifth LP  , where the band settle in for a solid set of righteous three-chord wonders delivered with a mean streak that will always be to the tastes of a certain doomy subset of ‘60s rock fans. There’s a ritualistic quality to the way the band whips themselves into a spectral sonic frenzy on every track, regardless of tone or tempo. Though the Shivas are here for the party, there are no sunshine sounds to be found, even when the band is proclaiming the joys of listening to the radio (“Playing on the Radio”) with lots of “Ba ba ba’s” in the chorus for everyone to sing along with. They also leave little room for bad vibes or fresh air while barreling through the many colorful moving parts of the blaringly wet and blown-out rave up “Feels Surreal.” But   is distinguished exactly by being 99% squall. “Lush” wouldn’t be a terrible word for the atmosphere the group conjures, if it weren’t for all the clanging guitars, layered, howling vocals and pounding drums that give the whole thing a cranked-up, ceremonial feel—the kind that asks full buy-in from listeners in return for a full dose. Yet the Shivas’ ability to corral such cacophony into songs full of propulsive groove and melodic throttle is their greatest strength as a unit, and they do so with obvious delight on the clamorous, catchy and discomfiting “Can’t Relax.“ Another highlight is drummer Kristin Leonard’s delivery of the drippy doo-wop torch ballad “If You See Me.” She’s got the pipes for the kind of unabashedly dramatic showing the song requires, and her warbling, sunken vocals creep slowly up to a dramatic belt that’s thrilling in its open-hearted intensity. For all its affected arcane gloom, however,   isn’t especially mysterious—though it does keep one foot in the grave at all times.

On  , their first release for Sub Pop, the group continues to explore the malaise of modern living, but this time, they’ve swapped jittery post-punk for full-bodied rock arrangements. As a result, the anxiety that permeates their prickly songs is mostly felt in their perceptive—and often downright terrifying—lyrics. Throughout  , Omni open windows into a series of morbid scenarios. “Courtesy Call” has the violence and bleak humor of a Tarantino film: a school teacher gets burned alive by their students, leaving behind only the keys to their SUV. (“The reason why the person is not getting a courtesy call is that they’re dead,” guitarist Frankie Broyles deadpanned in a  ). “Sincerely Yours” offers an equally eerie, but less dramatic, account of the soul-sucking nature of corporate employment (“At happy hours we talk and talk / Are you nervous for your career?”), recalling The National at their most class-conscious.

If “Black Transit Of Jupiter’s Third Satellite” is the final push, then final track “Occulting Disk 8” is the denouement, a five-minute undulating drone that crescendos gently before rolling back, allowing the listener to reflect on what’s gone before—the will and energy of ritual and creation—prior to the silence, waiting for the universe’s response.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-deathprod-occulting-disk"}

On previous records, Falana processed, layered, and distorted her vocal tracks until they became just another plug-in in her arsenal. On  , though, she opts for something more harrowingly direct. The results can be subtle, but they’re always surprising. She punctuates “Everyone is Gonna Be Okay,” a Ride-style rush of overdriven guitars, with a snotty, nasal kick that recalls Kathleen Hanna and Patti Smith, instantly transitioning the song from a swan dive to a crane kick. “Come On Over” charts a course directly between Echo & the Bunnymen and the Black Angels, with Falana chanting the title’s demand with equal parts lust and malice, carrying the song’s seven-plus minutes on her snarl alone. particularly glows during its heaviest moments, as on the cosmically doomy title track.

But the raw humanity in every second of this lovingly curated compilation is still vital. Compilation producer Ramona Stout was a professional crate-digger in Chicago when she uncovered the mega-rare ’60s and ’70s Midwestern gospel singles collected here, and her expertise shows. Mostly self-released micro-pressings, these aren’t the kind of records you can just grab from eBay or Discogs—you’ve got to get your hands dirty. And if you want to gather information about them you’ve got to do some serious detective work—which Stout also did. For the most part, this isn’t clap-shout, good-time gospel. There’s an almost grim determination that comes through on many of the tracks—the kind that comes from inner-city African-American communities dealing with the struggles of daily life. After all, what’s gospel music about, if not transcending earthly adversity by keeping a divine purpose in mind? Rev. H.H. Harrington’s “Black Pride,” which sounds as much like a DIY post-punk obscurity as a gospel tune, goes so far as to detail the social issues of the place and time; those tribulations are the subtext throughout the record. The minor-key modes of many tunes add an almost ominous quality, whether it’s the Wondering Gails’ “The Number,” with its haunted organ and New Orleans funeral-stroll pace; The Georgia Brooks Singers’ stark, stern warning to sinners on “You Can’t Make It;” or the downright creepy vibe of Joanne & Sonny’s venture into the great beyond on “Journey.” Sometimes, the feel is straight-up funky (The Messiahs of Glory’s title track, for example), but frequently it’s lo-fi and ultra-minimal. Christopher King did a magical job remastering these tunes from the original 45s, making beyond-rough source material eminently listenable without sacrificing its unvarnished appeal. And when those testifying voices cry out, baked in half-century-old reverb, that gloriously ghostly quality becomes all the more palpable.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-no-other-love-midwest-gospel-review"}

Now, 11 years later, Forge has receded into the background, leaving Franck to be the North Star on the group’s fourth record,   Aside from that, though, not much has changed; the group still ably turns out songs informed by a panoply of global styles—this time, primarily samba, tropicalia, and Ethio-jazz—and they’re still bolstered by a small army of musicians, including Bembé Segué, Syren Rivers, Luiz Gabriel Lopes, Diabel Cissokho, Vanessa Freeman, and more. The strongest moments on   are the ones where the group fully commits to their globetrotting impulses. Album-opener “Mentality” finds an unlikely middle ground between deep Afrofunk grooves and the kind of sunshine pop practiced by ‘60s groups like The Free Design, counterbalancing a groaning bari sax line and deep baritone vocals with eerie soprano harmonies that drift in the air above like kites. “Dakar” is a low-lit Ethio-jazz groove that floats atop a humming organ line, its snakeline melody curving and dipping. They veer hard into samba on “Memory Man,” using its sprightly rhythms to support a soulful vocal; and the title track runs furthest afield, nailing the light, airy sound of a vintage Paul McCartney ballad.

Some of this duality can be chalked up to Panic Girl’s background: she was classically trained in piano, guitar, and voice before she turned her attention to electronic music.

{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0017852037_2.jpg", "album": "Pata Pata", "artist": "Miriam Makeba", "description": "By early 1967, Miriam Makeba’s career was well under way: she’d been performing in Johannesburg since she was a child, and by the 1950s she was singing professionally with all-girl group The Skylarks, moving between jazz, popular African songs, and Western soul. But despite her talent and charm, she was virtually unknown beyond the South African borders. All of that changed in 1959, when the young artist appeared in U.S. filmmaker Lionel Rogosin’s acclaimed anti-apartheid documentary  . Angered by her political stance, South Africa’s white supremacist government banned her from returning home, and, after a short stint in Europe, Makeba landed in New York City. Within weeks, she was touring with Harry Belafonte (and would go on to perform with him at  ’s Madison Square Garden birthday party), performing at Martin Luther King Jr.’s marches, and appearing regularly on primetime television. Throughout the 1960s, her fame spread across the USA and Europe, and in 1966 she became the first African woman to win a Grammy. But it was in 1967, with her incredibly catchy smash hit “Pata Pata,” that Makeba became a global sensation. The song, which musicologist Rob Allingham calls “probably the best-known song of African origin in the world,” had previously been recorded by Makeba and The Skylarks in 1959, but this brighter, uptempo version, produced by R&B producer Jerry Ragovoy, proved irresistible to audiences all over the world. Makeba herself never quite understood the success of “Pata Pata,” and thought of it as a “fun little song” but with “no meaning.” That’s even more striking within the context of the album, recently reissued by Strut Records in both mono and stereo versions, which is full of brazenly political tracks and hard-hitting social commentary. “West Wind,” a soft soul track written by Makeba’s daughter Bongi (and later covered by Nina Simone) deals with themes of Pan-Africanism and racial equality: “Westwind with your splendor / Take my people by the hand / Spread your glory sunshine / Unify mother Africa / Unify my precious land.” In “Piece of Ground,” with a touch of bitter irony, she tackles colonialism, land grabbing, and slavery, singing, “Now this land is so rich and it seems strange to me / That the black man whose labor has helped it to be / Cannot enjoy the fruits that abound / Is uprooted and kicked from his own piece of ground.” Makeba always insisted she was not a political singer, but (echoing anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko, who once said that South African are, by default, involved in politics) that she simply sang the truth about what happened in South Africa, “especially the things that hurt.” Taken in its entirety,   epitomizes Makeba’s cosmopolitan, international outlook. There are songs that represent the multicultural landscape where she grew up, inspired by the Swazi, Zulu (“Pata Pata,” for example), and Xhosa people (such as the hit “Click Song Number One,” and “Jol’inkomo”) folk songs. But she also looked to other parts of the African continent: on “Ha Po Zamani,” for example, she sings in Swahili, while “Yetentu Tizaleny” is a wonderfully impassioned cover version of a track by Ethiopian singer Tilahun Gessesse. In this album, and throughout her career, Makeba stayed true to her culture, her conscience, and her integrity, while also introducing the world to the sounds of her continent.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/miriam-makeba-pata-pata-review"}

That weighty subject matter is echoed by the sound of musicians’ lap steel and baritone guitars, Tcherepnin’s Sonica analog oscillator synth, and David Silver’s somber drumming. The result is an album that is appropriately mournful, offering reminders of life’s fragility. The ten-minute “Death of a Seagull” opens with plaintive swirls of synth and guitar before soaring off into psychedelia, as Tcherepnin sings of coasting beyond the clouds on “wings of desire.” The  slow, undulating synths on “Existential Blowfish” communicate the sinking feeling of defeat and surrender.  The album’s opening and closing tracks establish its emotional arc. The 15-minute “Assisted Suicide” is serene in its contemplation of exhausted faith, and the feeling life has run its natural course. “The world will miss you / But it’s time to go,” sings Tcherepnin calmly. The sentiment is countered by album closer “Suicide Alley,” where a riotous explosion of drums and Shimada’s cackling shehnai riffs end the album on a note of defiance.

It’s part candlelit, champagne-smooth R&B musings on love, sex, and relationships; part lush ‘80s synth-pop dissections of intergenerational trauma and recovery; and part jazzy hip-hop precision and empowerment. It’s all tied together under a sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit anti-capitalist ethic: “Never met a CFO that had me feeling ravenous,” Hua Li sings on “Social Meds.” The record opens with “Paper Sons,” a reference to the strategies used by Chinese immigrants in circumventing racist immigration policy in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. The song begins and ends with clips of Hua Li’s mother, aunt, and grandmother speaking, sampled from voice memos and phone calls. At the end of the first verse, Hua Li calls for solidarity: “We keep it coming like it’s 1965 / Like Huey Newton’s still alive, like AAPA still building ties,” namechecking the socialist Black Panther leader and the anti-imperialist Asian American Political Alliance. “Mr. Greenlight” eviscerates abusive, manipulative white men in power: “Distinguished white man, you always get more / More money, more bitches, more babies, more hitches / Nothing you can’t handle though, never dealt a hand too low.” At the midway point, “Recitation (Interlude)” features collaborator Raquel Wang reciting a poem by Chinese poet Li Bai called “Thoughts On A Still Night” over top of a ricocheting keyboard patch and a recurring sample of someone inhaling sharply. Thematically and texturally, it is a poignant capsule of Hua Li’s work: connections drawn between past and present, ruminations on the inescapable consequences associated with the passage of time. The poem’s last two lines read, “I raise my head and look at the bright moon / I lower my head and think of home.” Somehow, amid all that chaos and tumult, she’s managed to find peace—and this stellar reflection attests to that.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/hua-li-dynasty-review"}

Skittering without being scattershot, “Nah” encapsulates PYJÆN’s approach to experimental jazz. “Free Your Dreams,” delves further into the brass, and the slower “Steve” diverges from the uptempo sound of the other songs, acting as a laidback meditation. Mellow middle track “Leading the Times” is a standout, boasting a vibrant and ascendent guitar solo, and “Waiting for Perry” is propelled forward with a steady marching beat.

The Chicago quintet formed in the early 2010’s as a precocious group of teenage garage-rock disciples, and their first few records fit snugly alongside the San Francisco garage revival of the time. But with their 2016 record   the group shifted from stomping fuzz-pop to strolling blues that had more in common with Van Morrison than Ty Segall or Jay Reatard. On  , Twin Peaks double down on that style, finding their sweet spot in a mix of foot-tapping jams and glass-raising ballads. In a concerted effort to capture the freewheeling energy of their live shows, they enlisted English producer Ethan Johns, who’s known for tracking live recordings with arena-sized acts like Paul McCartney and Kings of Leon. Considering that was the goal,  is a monumental success; Twin Peaks radiate the loose confidence of a live band throughout the entire record. Standouts like the breezy “Better Than Stoned” and the funky “Dance Through It” lock into grooves that gradually crescendo into hearty group choruses, surrounded by plunky keyboard solos and warm trumpet gusts, respectively. “Ferry Song” recalls the uplifting tempo and sweet melody of Hall and Oates’ “Rich Girl,” and co-vocalist Colin Croom pays obvious homage to The Band in the folk-rockin’ “Laid In Gold.” But Twin Peaks sound the most comfortable and the most themselves on the album’s title track, a bombastic sing-along that’s speckled with Clay Frankel’s charming “oh’s” and “ow’s” during the song’s generous climax. This latest iteration of the band sounds virtually unrecognizable from their early work, and that may be a turn-off for longtime fans.

On their self-titled, fourth LP, the Seattle band don’t get any closer to clarity, but they do arrive at an emotional détente of sorts: there won’t be   catharsis, at least not yet, or perhaps, never.

But the surface-level tranquility serves only to obscure. Later, on the brutally pretty self-critique “Drown,” Shapiro softly confesses what’s been true all along: “Repeated meaningless words don’t work / Speech is pointless.” There’s nothing glamorous about the personality crisis happening on  : We’re not drowning our sorrows on a Grecian isle, we’re just going to the bar in a Toyota Rav-4 (“Rav-4.”) This is a record about giving up, with no anticipation of better things on the horizon.

As a beatmaker and composer, SassyBlack revels in dashing expectations that come with certain melodic themes: The frictionless vocals and cardiac bass-kick percussion of opener “Left or Right” have all the hallmarks of a low-lit romantic overture, but as the song progresses, it becomes clear that any love will have to come from within—an extended bout of existential unease has left Harris-White feeling invisible to everyone but herself. “Do It” has the bump-and-grind tension and edge-of-euphoria anticipation that’s fueled R&B songs from Aaliyah onward, but every verse only feints towards a declaration of love. By the song’s end, Harris-White admits how difficult it all is (“We laugh and lust most days and nights / But in the end we know this shit ain’t right”). And the most life-affirming song on the album—a pulsebeat dose of minimalist funk and electric piano glow centered around a spiritual house-worthy hook—is named “Depression.” But it’s not all ambivalence or anxiety; how can it be when she’s got determination? SassyBlack knows exactly what she’s doing (see “Recommendations,” which she’s not seeking), where she’s going (“Forward Thinking,” where she “can’t let you get in front of me”), and what inspires her (“Fluidity,” as in the adaptability that comes with freedom and vice-versa).

In the midst of this carefully programmed hubbub, there are pensive moments of grace, such as opener “Amethyst,” a track that could have been part of The Next Great American Ambient Album.   closes anxiously with “Bit Rot,” an elegant exercise in contemporary breaks studies, a surprisingly dancefloor-ready mix of structured hardcore and experimental glitch.

Like many artists in London’s fertile jazz scene, Armon-Jones received his education at Trinity Laban music school before joining in sessions with youth jazz collective Tomorrow’s Warriors. Equally important in Armon-Jones’s development was his father, a jazz-fusion musician who passed on his love of the spacey, free flowing sounds of the analog keys to his son. Continually inquisitive and spontaneous, Armon Jones’s debut LP for Brownswood,   owed as much to the dub reggae of King Tubby and the street sounds of London as the abstract fusion of Herbie Hancock. On his new record,   Armon-Jones enlists the same group of musicians from his first LP (guitarist Oscar Jerome, drummers Moses Boyd and Kwake Bass, saxophonist Nubya Garcia, and bassists David Mrakpor and Mutale Chashi) to create one of the most important LPs to emerge from the young London scene. Loose and languid, the opener “Try Walk With Me” (featuring the evocative vocals of Asheber) sets the tone, before guest Georgia Anne Muldrow delivers one of her finest vocal performances on the sublime neo-soul jazz track “Yellow Dandelion.” As woozy as it is exploratory, the single “Icy Roads (Stacked)” sends Armon-Jones’s analog keys swirling around Kwake Bass’s off-kilter drums and killer bass hooks by Chashi.

The theme is clear from the outset: the album opens with “St. Matthew (AGAPE),” invoking the Greek word for the love between God and humanity. Over a gorgeous, piano-driven backdrop, Muse delivers sharp, autobiographical bars: “Me at 16 swearing I’m gonna be a preacher / Me at 21, writing raps and ignoring teachers.” The song culminates in a simple, plaintive mantra declaring “St. Matthew” a song sung “for the love of God.” Muse explores the multi-faceted nature of love throughout  . The project’s first single, “Ain’t No (Philautia),” is an ice-cool, swaggering jam, with Muse flexing and shining brightly over a dark, mournful instrumental. The hook is vulnerable and self-affirming at the same time: “They say it ain’t no n***a like a Chi-town n***a / They say it ain’t no king like a South Side king.” Muse is part of the revolutionary tide of contemporary Black music ( ,  , Chance,  , and many more) that has been blossoming in the city of Chicago, and   is both powerful and deeply spiritual.

The song would later gain popularity via a cover by Big Brother & the Holding Company, but Thornton’s version here is a killer. With its otherworldly guitar solo, weeping brass, and rapturous vocals, Thornton’s rendition becomes a hot, screaming revelation of pain and longing.  Rounded out by performances from Muddy Waters, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Howlin’ Wolf, and more, the lineup reads like a who’s who of American popular music.

Weightless, insular soundscapes connect the album’s brightest moments, making them feel like extraterrestrial encounters. “The Internet Is Handmade” is a dark drift of naturalistic occultism in the spirit of both Current 93 and the bad-trip soundscapes of Nurse With Wound.

For much of  Purple Pilgrims abandon not only modern society, but the 21st century altogether, delivering tragic tales of gothic romance with light, ethereal vocals, setting them against delicate arrangements.

Lyrics encouraging empowerment are paired with funky, sensual rhythms, and frenetic beats. Opener “Flourish,” which features Angel Bat Dawid, is welcoming and enveloping, carried along by choir-like vocals. On “Against the Wall,” Free asks, “What would you do when your back’s against the wall?” She shifts from confrontation to affirmation on “Movement,” singing, “You’ve got to learn you, deeply / You’ve got to do you, completely.” And “Rushing In” is a song of joy and release, Free proclaiming, “I’m rushing into the sun / I’m rushing into the fun.”  In the Samoan language,   means “in front”; fittingly, composing and producing duo Roderick Jackson and Christopher Kramer, collectively known as Tensei, keep Free’s voice central in the mix and give her ample room to project purpose, confidence, and urgency. “No time to play around,” she sings on “Bold Heart,” a lush, seductive jazz number that could double as the album’s mission statement. “We know how to get lit / That’s not the point right now.” ", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/a-billi-free-tensei-i-luma-review"}

On her sophomore EP, Friday blends elements of drill, punk, 90s techno, industrial, and more to create songs that pulse with dark power and raw confidence. Album opener “Tear the Veil” sets the tone. A slow-burning number comprised of little beyond booming electronic beats, the song lays out Friday’s mission simply and plainly: “I want it? I get it/ I said, I want it? I get it.” What she wants on   is to explore every style on the darker end of the genre spectrum.“Fatal” is a shadowy dance number about the destructive power of love, with serrated synths that cut across a throbbing, hypnotic beat. “Treason” is overtly industrial—four minutes of electrical crackling behind an ominous bass beat and distant, garbled screams. The tone shifts radically on “Good and Evil,” a pulse-quickening raver that opens with rhythmic beat boxing and gradually gains speed until Friday appears with a scream about one minute in, kicking the song into high gear. It’s tempting to read some of this restlessness in the context of her backstory: Friday emigrated to Montreal from Nigeria as a child, and is now based in Vancouver; it’s possible that being in an “in-between” state is where she’s most comfortable.

Last month, Janet Weiss, the extraordinary drummer who has been a member of Sleater-Kinney since their third album  , announced she was  . “The band is heading in a new direction,” Weiss said, in a letter she posted on Instagram. “[It] is time for me to move on.” As it always does, internet speculation about her departure followed soon after—some of which centered around the idea that the presence of St. Vincent’s Annie Clark in the producer’s chair somehow minimized Weiss’s presence on the album. Remaining members Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein took great pains to set the record straight. In a recent  , Brownstein and Tucker say they’re not really sure why Weiss left—and that working with Clark was her idea. Brownstein said she thought “everyone was really happy about the record.” The conversations about Weiss’s departure are, in their own way, also conversations about history: the way the band looked and sounded 20 years ago vs. the way they look and sound today. But sonic innovation has always been a part of Sleater-Kinney’s past, and  has the same electricity as   or  . “Hurry On Home” meshes their riffs-forward approach with the urgent alt-pop of St. Vincent’s 2017 album   and gives them a space to explore Heart-like soul, a texture that bleeds throughout the record. The apocalyptic title track, with its harrowing, industrial rhythm, plunges the group in waves of digital distortion; album standout “Reach Out” crests in a gorgeous chorus buoyed by high-arcing vocal harmonies. Sleater-Kinney’s signature guitar harmonics feature prominently on “Restless,” and they tinker with taut staccato-style playing on “LOVE,” a song that documents the band’s history and works sly references to previous albums into its lyrics. And while the vast range of sonics on   might land just outside of the group’s usual punk-rock paradigm, it’s true to their overall approach—refining and redefining who they are with each new record.

Since releasing their eponymous EP in 2016, the group has made a point of celebrating queer female identity, in both their   and their public persona.

While the group previously incorporated elements of doo-wop into their indie rock anthems, here they pull from a wide swath of rock history, embracing a sumptuous hi-fi sound, to deliver a resounding message of resilience in the face of dissolving relationships. It also addresses the death of frontwoman Miriam Devora’s mother (whose photograph graces the album’s cover), and the challenges of being a queer woman in fraught times. Devora doesn’t merely process these traumas individually—she identifies situations in which they intertwine. “Tell Me,” for instance, turns an account of gaslighting (“You can’t sign away my rights on a dotted line”) into a testament to Devora’s resolve: “I’m a woman / And a woman knows her mind.” In “Rum Cheeks,” which channels the stately melancholy of Leonard Cohen, she searches for herself in the context of a tense relationship: “At your place / At   place?” she asks deftly. Instead of shying away from these moments of conflict, Queen of Jeans confront them with bombast.

But despite this turmoil and chaos, Mannequin Pussy end  on a wholly optimistic note, with the Throwing Muses-esque “In Love Again.” Dabice warmly hollers, “I’m so happy / Laying here with you / I’m in love with you,” and reminds us all that starting over is possible, even when things seem bleak.", "genre": ["Punk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mannequin-pussy-patience-review"}

Picking up where  , 2015’s excellent debut, left off, the group’s new album   offers a bold expansion on this infernal universe. Across the record, False leaven the autumnal, folk-metal grandeur of early Panopticon with the wintry trappings of their pre-existing sound; soaring guitar leads co-mingle with atonal, technical passages, contrast enabled through compromise. Riffs are just one aspect of the equation, though: the majestic synth arrangements, frenzied percussion, all vicious blasts and inventive fills, and the powerful vocals (or perhaps more accurately, ghoulish, grave-dirt-roughened rasps) all deepen the foreboding atmosphere with some of False’s best performances to date.  The three, gargantuan songs we’re left with—four if you count the outro, which clocks in at just over a minute, a far cry from the 10-minute-plus monsters lurking elsewhere—may very well be the strongest showing in the band’s decade-long career. Opener “A Victual to our Dead Selves” skews impossibly triumphant, boasting a blistering guitar solo at the close of the song. “Rime on The Song of Returning” utilizes almost angelic choral synths right before plunging into a harrowing gallop, showcasing False’s adeptness at both conjuring beauty and decay, sometimes in the same prolonged howl. The final and longest track, “The Serpent Sting, the Smell of Goat,” pulls heavily from funeral doom at the start, slowly and malevolently ramping up to the incendiary heights of the first two tracks.

It swirls and gathers steam with hypnotic fervor, rinsing the despair that builds up and calcifies in our bodies. The group pays homage to spaza culture by naming its songs after well-known South African brands, places and dishes; items like magwinya (deep-fried doughnuts), Sunlight soap, and mangola bologna are all referenced here. The songs on   feel remarkably visual—intriguing, yet somewhat strange to the ear. Through chants and rhythmic repetition (captured in one take), the group conveys both the ease and uncertainty of life in the townships—from the peace of walking down the road, to the violence that can erupt at a moment’s notice. By using effects pedals, wind instruments, djembe drums, synthesizers, violin and upright bass, the group creates a unique world full of surprises at every turn—for instance, the second half of the nine-minute “Magwinya, Mangola neWhite Liver” locks into a mesmerizing loop of rising vocals and orchestration that grows more urgent as it progresses. The next track, “Sunlight, Glycerine, 2 loose draws,” continues the trek, except here, it seems the vocalists are trying to summon rain and sunshine. Contrast that with “Ice Squinchies: Waiting for you,” the most accessible track on  : it mixes alt-soul and jazz, giving Siya Makuzeni a proper canvas to sing about finding love—here on earth or out there in the cosmos.

The album opens with the sound of someone dialing a rotary phone, and then bursts into a rhythmic track reminiscent of X, about the frustration of waiting for someone to call. Toody and Cole trade vocal duties throughout, which keeps the sound interesting. “Come on Toody” is a sweet, playful song, where Cole bemoans his wife’s tendency to make him late. “Just a Man,” sung by Toody, is post-punk satire about a jerk who lacks self-awareness (think Bikini Kill’s “ ”). “Just a Man” has a slow, bare-bones spoken word chorus, and a fast, catchy verse that builds into a Patti Smith-esque crescendo.

Stake your claim to a richer, fuller, happier life. Remember, all is not gold that glitters. Sometimes it’s Green.” Garson’s sprightly productions allude to everything from the psychedelic animation of the ’60s and ’70s to the lounge-pop loops and space-age soundtracks of Jean-Jacques Perrey and Air.

There is no greater struggle than that of the noble tabletop RPG warrior against the polyhedrons of fate as they cast the runes and pray that fate smiles upon their endeavors. It’s truly epic; something worth immortalizing in song. Many power metal bands have ventured into the dungeon to try to capture the vibe of the role-playing experience, but most roll critical fails (it’s very easy to fall into a spike trap of cheesiness). The Ventura-based,  -inspired metal outfit Gygax sidestep the pitfalls by approaching from a different angle: classic hard rock. Formed after the dissolution of the similarly Thin Lizzy-loving quartet Gypsyhawk, Gygax’s throwback hard rock sensibilities are drawn from the ‘70s, the same era that gave us   itself—there are big, melodic riffs, pulse-quickening tempos, gutsy vocals, and solos aplenty.

She keeps her tempos even-keeled, from the loose cha-cha pacing of “Good Ol’ Night” to the last-call slow dance of “Take a Load Off.” On the title track, a bittersweet island getaway is interrupted by heartbreak, but she follows her pain with an appeal for reconciliation in “Another Town,” singing, “So if you’re walking down the road and see me waving my hands / Can you help me with the load and let me tell you that I love you again.” The songs are fleshed out with assistance from Kath Bloom on harmonica, and TV on the Radio’s Kyp Malone—who also produced the LP—on electric guitar, keys, and percussion.

Taking an early-’90s Balearic dance sound as their starting point, the British industrial band leaven tribal techno with oddball beauty to create a bemusing album that channels their previous advocacy of HIV and AIDS awareness (consider their harrowing music video for “Tainted Love,” the proceeds of which went to an AIDS prevention organization) into soothing, heavy-lidded songs. The VHS might be long out of print, but the soundtrack itself, taken from engineer/producer Danny Hyde’s original masters, is now available for the first time on Musique Pour La Danse. Along with Hyde, foundational members John Balance and Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson built upon the acid-tinged, trance-like mysticism of their commercially successful album, 1991’s  . The first track, “Alternative Theme From Gay Man’s Guide to Safer Sex,” is a plumper edit of the slick and funky original theme that is featured on the VHS.

It’s a set-up worthy of a good anime or video game, but what makes Ileto’s debut so smart is how she always favors showing over telling. The 10 tracks on   each offer a highly distinct and fully formed glimpse of Ileto’s range. “The New Flesh” and “Maria’s Dream” both deploy razor-sharp grime with the pretty, icy minimalism of Boxed founder Mr. Mitch. “Catalyst” flies through frantic trance patterns before reaching a dizzying bridge of android baroque music, while “Exo” charges on rattling drums and menacing rave shimmers.  remains just as thrilling when it turns atmospheric. “Dissect” captures a grim corner of Ileto’s universe full of Gristleized electronic squelches that give way to hardcore techno punctuated by drums that clap like thunder. “Ingest” is even better for not ever breaking the tension.

On “Ryūgū-jō,” de Clive-Lowe brings violinist Tylana Enomoto on board, varying the sound more still; with “Shitennō” he toggles between a stark Eastern melody and a beautiful chord cycle reminiscent of neo-soul, turning Johnson loose on alto.

That sense of perpetual dissatisfaction has been reflected in the Toronto group’s relentless evolution. Once a caterwauling noise-punk outfit, Greys quickly realized that nihilistic discourse—however good it may feel in the moment—isn’t a long-term solution for life’s woes. As such, the band’s emotional vocabulary has expanded in step with their musical one. After balancing out the stage-dive strikes with shoegazing balladry on 2016’s   and detouring into fuzzy lo-fi indie-pop for the lowkey companion release  , Greys sound like they’re ready to leave the circle pit behind for good. Where this band’s entire aesthetic and ideological universe was once easily summarized by their 2014 single/mash note “Guy Picciotto,” Jiwani has teed up   by name-dropping late-’90s   touchstones like Madonna’s “Beautiful Stranger” and the Chemical Brothers. But here, Greys aren’t so much reliving their teenage past as pining for a future that never happened: a pre-millennial moment when alt-rock seemed to be entering an exciting new experimental phase, before post-Strokes retromania smothered the indiesphere in second-hand leathers. With their collision of dazed melodies, dirgey dissonance, and fractured industrial funk, songs like “Arc Light” and “Constant Pose” readily conjure the unsettled atmosphere of Blur’s 1999 bad-romance opus 13 (though in this case, Jiwani is feeling estranged not from his partner, but rather his increasingly expensive, condo-choked city.) Compared to Greys’ righteously indignant previous releases,   is practically paralyzed by disillusionment and doubt, as perfectly crystallized in the dream-pop drift of “Western Guilt.” But instead of letting those defeated feelings bubble up to a searing boil, Greys find catharsis through sheer audacity, fully obliterating their already-distended musical boundaries with the seven-minute motorik/dub suite “Aphantasia” and the siren-blaring “Setting Sun” swirl of “These Things Happen.” On the latter song, Jiwani laments he’s “Part of a useless generation / Got no goddamn imagination,” but embedded in that dismissal is a recognition of untapped potential.

Darkness is always close by in her songs, but Lahey tames her demons with buoyant melodies and thundering power chords. The album’s explosive opener, “I Don’t Get Invited To Parties Anymore,” is a boisterous look at the tension between fading youth and adult responsibility. “Has my fun gone out the door?” she glumly asks at one point. She answers her own question shortly thereafter, by way of the roaring power pop of “Don’t Be So Hard On Yourself,” where she sings, “You haven’t had a day off in weeks / Your voice is shaking when you speak / It might not be my place to help / But don’t be so hard on yourself.” By maintaining this tender sense of conviction throughout, Lahey sends the album’s arc with a bit of hope. It’s an album about feeling the lowest of the lows, but also celebrating the highest of the highs. Songs like “Am I Doing It Right” and “Interior Demeanour” scan as letters Lahey has written to herself, offering both determination and reassurance.

A daring arranger, Phillips assembles various sonic trinkets into stunning, nonsensical concoctions. Take the programmed, muscular percussion slaps that power “Before,” juxtaposed with delicate, wailing Eastern-style guitar. Or Shahzad Ismaily’s offbeat kick drum on “Can’t Get Around,” which is matched with some pretty piano chords. Nothing in these arrangements feels like they should fit, and yet   is completely compelling. Phillips has a created a patchwork of dueling patterns that begs you to deconstruct each track, so you can examine each and every component. The biggest divergence from   is the addition of sung vocals. Phillips’s singing voice actually sounds a bit like Sting—that is, if the famed Police man had fallen into a totally different line of work. The gentle vocal of “1000 Ways” flows as an internal monologue interwoven with sanguine metaphors for feelings pulsing deep inside: “When I looked I knew I had to find / Where it hit my blood I had to know.” Other lyrics skew more simple and sobering; in “Floating,” he frames life as the act of “Floating in a cloud and getting old.” But even when Phillips’s words scan as the thoughts of a fallen angel, his radiant arrangements pierce through the gloaming, rather than perpetuate it.

Then Natalie Hoffmann enters with straightforward vocal delivery, painting a picture of despondency. The song’s subject feels lost, eyes looking down, staying “low on the sidewalk.” It brought to mind the obsessive psychosis of the protagonist of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s short story “The Yellow Wallpaper,” where a shut-in woman circles her bedroom so many times she creates a “ ” where her shoulder fits right in.  The creepiness of Gilman’s story perfectly sets the mood for  , a post-punk record filled with moody intensity and impossibly tight beats that get into the psyche like the onset of a panic attack. Though the Memphis band is now a three-piece, they haven’t lost any sonic depth—Hoffman now handles guitar and keyboard duties. The synth, while not present on every song, only increases the eerie feel, as in the otherworldly tones of “In Glass.” That said, “Woman Alone,” arguably the album’s best track, is synth-free; Hoffman’s guitar makes beautifully frantic sounds throughout, not unlike Carrie Brownstein during Sleater-Kinney’s more high-energy songs. “What’s it like / What’s it like / What’s it like to feel a constant gaze,” Hoffman implores.

And while ’60s psych pop, vintage soundtracks, and library music remain the touchstones on their third LP,  the results feel bigger and grander. If their previous albums were 16mm films, this one’s 35. Frontwoman Marleen Nilsson’s wispy, layered vocals feel constantly on the verge of floating into the ether, but they remain tethered to each track by insistent, almost demandingly catchy basslines. (See “Eye Bath,” which balances juddering reverb with a chunky, loping groove.) In “Let’s Never Leave Here,” shimmering synths spiral into a breakdown that diffuses gradually, like a comet’s tail. It’s not hard to imagine “The Hum,” a slow, sparkling waltz set in motion by the brittle blips of a drum machine, echoing through the chambers of a deserted space station.

Whereas their peers galvanize the subgenre’s requisite anguish into big-tent brutalism ( ), turgid grunge-gaze (Pianos Become the Teeth), and wide-eyed alternative rock (mewithoutYou), the Michigan band play what is essentially the emo equivalent of spoken word—slam poetry at its most sullen. Listening to frontman Jordan Dreyer’s tense, eloquent monologues on 2008’s  , with their tight prose and copious references to Japanese folklore, Edgar Allen Poe, and Kurt Vonnegut, one might swear they’d stumbled in on a depressive creative writing workshop. Despite this literary bent, La Dispute never force sentiment in their stories; they simply lay out the scenery, leaving us to read between the lines.  The band’s Epitaph debut,  , is a little bit of a paradox—a carefully-measured reflection on cheery topics like time, memory, death, and grief, which just so happens to feature their dreamiest material to date. Thematic and textural contrasts feature heavily across these tracks; take the two-part “Fulton Street,” which finds Dreyer describing grim roadside discoveries (hell, the very first words we hear on the album are “Found a body at the rest stop”) as sparse, faintly-strummed chords flutter in the margins. The record’s most aggressive track, “View From Our Bedroom Window,” also resembles a tug of war between the seething and the serene, propping up imagery of house fires and harrowing night drives against a delicate, pastoral backdrop.

Classic soul instrumentation backs pleas for a lover to return on one song, and chopped soul samples underscore tales of intergenerational racial violence on another. Across all of those topics,   simmers with frustration at the cycle of racism that has persisted in America through all of the eras its music references. It’s in the pounding, cyclical samples of  ’s explosive title track and in similar grinding repetitions on “Feels.” “Decade after decade, change comes no faster,” vocalist James Longs sings on “At The Wall,” a song about trying to escape the maze of systemic inequality.

It’s an arresting image to be sure, but it also drives home one of the album’s major themes: the ways human beings weaponize both tools and attitudes. Concept-heavy albums like this are Quelle’s forte: 2013’s   imagined life as a race; 2017’s   was about accepting your own imperfections. And 2018’s  recorded with Jean Grae and named Bandcamp’s #1  —was a kind of national psychological evaluation, with a grim diagnosis.   digs even deeper into that theme, trying to unearth the root causes of societal evils. Quelle’s voice—alternately grainy and pliable, enthused and exhausted—is the perfect vehicle for this kind of multilayered social commentary. On the stripped-down “Spray and Pray,” he considers the way children valorize criminals; that idea of children being socialized around weapons carries through to the title track, where a character named Kelly shoots up her school because, “where she’s from, them 22s more patriotic than pie.” Elsewhere, he takes aim at selective law enforcement and religious justifications for violence, dismantling them over production that feels dark and claustrophobic, full of deftly-chopped piano lines, queasy bass, and groaning organs. While   has its sights set on the evils of men, Quelle’s commitment to crafting albums with a clear arc means it ends on a moving, tender note. The penultimate song “You, Me & Nobody Else” expresses gratitude for finding a soulmate. On the album-closing “WYRM,” over a contemplative piano loop, Quelle considers his impact and artistic legacy. It’s a fitting ending;   may be given over to examining the darkness in the world, but it never loses sight of the humanity that’s at stake.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/quelle-chris-guns-review"}

But this musical odyssey to Sin City was made by Julio “Chocolate” Algendones, the brilliant percussionist and star of Afro-Peruvian music, who passed away in 2004. Mostly recorded during a trip to the U.S. with his group Perujazz, Algendones’s   connects festejo rhythms—a festive form of Afro-Peruvian music—with the traditional Yoruba sounds of Western Africa and spiritual patterns of the Santeria religion.  The arrangements are minimalist to the point of being austere as Algendones uses only a few time-honored percussion instruments—congas, kalimbas, seeds, and cajón—to build his textured orchestration. This unfurnished approach might take time for newcomers to fully appreciate, but the rhythmic play on the 14-minute “Conga Forte, Rico Cajón” rewards patience. You can feel Chocolate’s hands rap the rawhide skin as this soothing piece evokes imaginary ritual ceremonies.

This compilation, which serves as a kind of restatement of purpose, features two songs each from a number of the label’s notable alumni (including Cheer-Accident and The Flying Luttenbachers), alongside tracks by newer, like-minded bands. The Flying Luttenbachers re-record one older song (“Demonic Velocities”) and deliver one all-new one (“Prelude To Mutation”); Cheer-Accident offer a King Crimson-gone-funk tune (“War Is A Warrior”) and a dreamy ballad (“Site”); and Cellular Chaos deliver two shrill, caterwauling pieces that keep the rock in noise-rock. One group making its debut here, before releasing a full-length album at month’s end, is Skryptor, the kinda-sorta all-star trio of former Dazzling Killmen guitarist Tim Garrigan, former Craw bassist David McClelland, and STATS drummer Hank Shteamer (also a highly respected music journalist/critic). Their music is crushingly heavy, meant to be played as loud as possible; “Red Mountain” is pure arena-rock shred madness, with massive, Steve Albini-sized drums (actual engineering and mixing:  ). The sequencing works very well, as immediately palatable acts are followed by noisier and more aggressive ones and vice versa. As a result, the ultra-aggro stuff (the Flying Luttenbachers, Child Abuse) seems even more like a kick in the ear, while Bobby Conn’s novelty pop songs are less jarring when plopped between Skryptor and Cellular Chaos than they’d otherwise be.

Only alt-weeklies and zines covered its artists, and discovery meant scouring liner notes, regularly perusing your local record store, and going to a venue where you trusted the booker’s taste, even if you didn’t know the bands playing. I know this comes up a lot when old jerks like me are talking, but pre-Internet saturation, seeking out the music was just as important a part of the process as actually hearing it. At least among the people I knew, owning a copy of Rodan’s   was just as important to being clued-in about   as Slint’s  , and you   to track down a copy of   on VHS, the charming 1994 independent film where Rodan played a band called Truckstop, formed when a bunch of high school teens steal a van and hit the road. (I have a distinct memory of the employees at my local Erol’s Video being pretty annoyed with me for my pesky special-order.) Rodan were only around for two years, from 1992 to 1994. Still, they had an outsized impact, both in influencing kids my age to start bands, and breaking ground with the various projects their members went on to found:  , June of 44, Retsin,  ,  ,  . (Bassist/guitarist/vocalist   is also known for her luminous and varied experimental solo work.)

Here, the band is flush with exuberance, making their intricate and unpredictable song structures seem like second nature. Chaotic epic “The Everyday World of Bodies” is choppier and noisier; O’Neil burns and seethes on “Jungle Jim” (where she’s pushed back in the mix a bit on the   version); and the rickety, noisy spiral at the end of “Gauge” sounds thrilling. “Exoskeleton,” which was only available in live and truncated form for a very long time, perfectly illustrates Rodan’s mastery of tension and dissonance, how a beautiful guitar phrase set with a spacious arrangement could turn on a dime into a dark, terrifying, exhilarating passage.   feels the closest a studio recording could come to seeing Rodan live; O’Neil, Noble, and fellow guitarist/vocalist Jeff Mueller sometimes moved on stage together in parallel to their complex lines, criss-crossing and interweaving, playing as though they were not only exorcising personal demons but that the nightly ritual also felt  . This release benefits the Louisville chapter of the always-worthy   organization, and it will be both a welcome supplement for longtime heads to help remember what made Rodan so special and an invitation for those who missed them the first time around to have their first experience be visceral and urgent.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-hardcore"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/rodan-hat-factory-93-review"}

He’s a self-described agnostic with a passion for sacred music (he has a history of singing in church choirs). He’s a composer who creates noncommercial music for his own projects, but has worked with popular comics of late-night TV (including Stephen Colbert and David Letterman). And, as a musician, he’s been known to adapt his talents for any style, performing in orchestras, ambient ensembles, rock bands, and disco groups, among other settings. All of those experiences (sans disco, perhaps) come into play on Burhans’s latest album,  , a collection of four pieces from his decades-spanning catalog of works thematically centered around grief—not just as a response to death or failed relationships, but also to time, opportunity lost to addiction, and changing eras and identities (he wrote 2010’s “Requiem for General Motors in Janesville, Wisconsin” after the auto plant in his hometown ceased production). But where his 2013 album   mixes reverent choral vocals with lush orchestral arrangements,   is characterized by sparse, profoundly intimate instrumentals that feel more like a private mediation than communal ritual. Co-produced with Grey Mcmurray, Burhans’s collaborator in electro-acoustic duo itsnotyouitsme, the record does a lot within that context. Opener “A Moment for Jason Molina”—a tribute to the indie songwriter who passed away in 2013—features Simon Jermyn on guitar and recalls some of the earthy, soul-stirring qualities of Molina’s music. “Contritus,” performed by New York’s JACK Quartet, channels a contemplative, cinematic rollercoaster of emotions. After a gentle marimba and harp performance on “Once in a Blue Moon,” Burhans closes things out with “Early Music (for a Saturday),” merging stoic bass guitar and minimalist electronic blips into an interplanetary journey that slowly dissolves into the white light of the beyond. In many faiths and traditions, mourning is viewed as an act for the living. Likewise,   doesn’t just seek to honor departed friends or note a closing chapter of life, but to explore the unanswered questions and complex feelings of the bereaved. Though the moods might be sad, Burhans always provides plenty of space for reflection. And in times where personal tragedies often play out more publicly on a more massive scale than ever, this album feels like a gift.", "genre": ["Experimental", "guitar"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/caleb-burhans-past-lives-review"}

It’s been four years since Laufer’s last album, and he’s spent the intervening years producing songs for artists like Post Malone, Yung Lean, Lil Yachty, and Chance The Rapper. Maybe   is his reaction against regularity and song structure; it truly sounds like music from the fringes, the sort of thing you could imagine coming from an edgy experimentalist on some micro tape label, not a successful L.A. rap/R&B producer. Much of the album’s first half is a cunning fusion of Sabbath-y doom guitars and scampering electro/trap drum machines. But as the album goes on, its palette broadens. There are acres of shivering ambience and early Aphex Twin mania (“Panic Attack”), degraded VHS spaghetti western funk (the title track, which conjures the bizarre image of Dylan Carlson jamming with Nite Jewel), and Burial-style tick-tock rhythms (“Watching a Video”). But all of it holds together; the usual lo-fi signifiers—layers of hiss, cheap drum machines, nauseous   tape—are everywhere, but it never feels naïve or slapdash. It is both vast scope and surprisingly intimate, and the powerful ambivalence between grand anxiety and a desire to care is expressed eloquently. It’s horrible and very, very beautiful, all at the same time.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/shlohmo-end-review"}

Aesthetically, it provides a snapshot of the international dance music scene; with this many songs, it’s tough to zero in on a single throughline, but the vast majority of the artists here incorporate traditional musics into their pulsing, rippling songs. But there’s a more practical function, too.

(Proceeds from the compilation benefit those same groups.) There’s a reason to be wary of compilations that run this long—too many of them succumb to a kind of “table scraps” mentality where the nobility of the cause is allowed to outshine the caliber of the music. Fortunately, everyone involved in   brought their A-Game. To try to round up highlights would require more space than we have here, but there are a few that leap out: “Rundfunk” by Curses tugs a razor-edged surf guitar across a bed of throbbing bass; Chancha Via Circuito continues to prove himself one of the most inventive digital cumbia producers working today—his contribution “Nagual” wrings maximum tension from an ominous low-end rhythm, dusting it sparingly with mournful flutes. The delightfully inscrutable Dengue Dengue Dengue pushes far into the avant-garde, constructing “Ringding” from a wobbly, off-kilter rhythm, a synth line that borders on darkwave, and a haunting griot-like vocal melody. Stefano Ritteri’s “Dope Mani” seems lit up in neon, a euphoric vocal sample spliced and looped over a walloping club beat; and Little Boots teams with Cyril Hahn for one of the comps most straightforward songs, a bit of airy R&B full of flutters and sighs. Not only does the caliber of the music justify  ’s formidable running time, but the intention behind the compilation ensures those efforts are in the service of noble ends.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-earth-night-review"}

It’s to Blakrok’s credit, then,  , her first full-length project since 2013’s  , sounds like it was recorded entirely on her own creative terms. It’s a 12-track record that whisks the listener away to a beguiling science fiction world of Blakrok’s own conjuring, where astrological and futuristic references mix with naturalistic and mystical imagery to create an album that positively hums with otherworldly atmosphere.  This vivid worldbuilding begins with producer  ‘s transcendental beats. Keeping in line with previous sci-fi rap projects like   and  ‘s misadventures as Dr. Octagon, the production combines gritty drums that sound like they’re sampled from a dusty ’60s funk 45 with eerie synths and woozy ambient spot effects. (Appropriately, Keith cameos on “Mars Attacks.”) Against this intoxicating backdrop, Blakrok traverses a realm of twisted organic matter where hip-hop’s standard sucker MCs have been replaced by mythological characters. On “Picture Box,” she goes from communicating with Aries through her pineal gland, to threatening she’ll “trigger moonquakes” cast from her spellbook. Next, she’s “chasing phantasms” and rescuing sacred stone tablets over the hazy drums and moody bass twangs of “Monatomic Mushroom.” Like all good sci-fi experiences, there’s a dystopian murmur throughout  ; it comes to a climax on the poignant, static-crusted closing cut, “Land of Gray,” where our hero gazes out over scorched lands, raises her scepter, and sagely rues how “man’s awakening is accompanied by grief.” As the song fades into fuzz and reverb, you’ve witnessed the confirmation of a truly individual new rap voice.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/yugen-blakrok-anima-mysterium-review"}

The New York-based trio Skryptor might not even consider themselves math rock—their bio accurately references metal pioneers Black Sabbath and free jazz destroyer Sonny Sharrock—but their debut album  recalls the dizzying heights of that genre’s peaks nonetheless, sifting scaling guitars and calculator rhythms into roller coaster tunes.  Giving complex music a gut-level impact is easier if you’ve honed your craft into a second nature, and the three members in Skryptor have a worthy pedigree. Bassist David   and guitarist Tim Garrigan once purveyed heavy jams for Midwest hard-workers Dazzling Killmen and Craw; when he’s not   about brain-busting music himself, drummer Hank Shteamer plays for prog-metal trio Stats. The trio’s collective experience is clear in their music’s precision, but it also helps them avoid the deadening repetition that a relentless attack can often fall into. To that end,  doesn’t contain songs so much as it does multitudes. On the mini-marathon “Lotus and Mace,” Skryptor scale ascending, stair-like riffs to beatific interludes, stopping to admire the view as they go. They indulge their Sabbath side on the grinding “Red Mountain,” spiking sludge with caffeinated accelerations. They can even get mellow, as in lengthy closer “Summer Blossoms,” whose dreamy tone is grounded by slashing chords and an earth-bound beat.

Longtime fans may trace its minimal tracks—many of which feature nothing but a basic guitar progression and gaunt electronic grooves—back to Panda Bear’s first widely available LP, 2004’s  . In spirit, at least. A healing set of hymnals for Lennox’s father, who was facing the final stages of terminal cancer at the time,   actually has more in common with the abstract folk cuts of Animal Collective ( , especially) than Panda Bear’s new palette. Beginning with the splish-splash overtones of “Dolphin,”  takes the spacious production techniques of trap and dub in entirely new directions. You’ll need a decent set of speakers or headphones to appreciate its life aquatic loops, but the main takeaway is music that’s deceptively simple. So while you may find yourself humming alongside the Auto-Tuned hooks of spare numbers like “Master,” “Cranked,” and “Token,” nothing on here reaches for the rafters like Panda Bear’s last full-length did (see: the pure bombast of “Mr Noah” and echo chamber expressionism of “Boys Latin”). Instead,  gets under your skin, tackling human desire and today’s omnipresent technology head-on. It’s hard to think of a Panda Bear song as unsettling as “Inner Monologue,” for instance. Centered around the string-padded cries (or is it moans?) of someone who’s clearly distraught, it features robotic, free-associative rhymes along the lines of “Look, up from the screen / My god, ran away / Don’t run away / We ran away / Don’t run away.” Good luck guessing what he’s talking about; maybe it’s better to witness Panda Bear’s rebirth firsthand, and let his deeply human narratives wash over us all once again.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/panda-bear-buoys-review"}

With a discerning palette of bass, drum machines, and a slyly monochrome speak-sing, the Washington, D.C. artist created short post-punk songs that felt more like fragments, like snatches of possibility. Her anchor was an unimpeachably great sense of rhythm that made her understated oeuvre feel instantly classic.  Moolchan’s latest record and second for Merge,  , finds her coming deeper into her own beguiling voice. She sounds keenly self-aware of it, placing a cheeky skit right at the beginning: “Oh my gosh,  is coming out on Merge Records, get it today!” a voice squeals over a rattling beat. Soon after, on the coasting highlight “Ecstasy,” Moolchan leads a delightful chant: “Long / Live / Sneaks.” These self-referential twists give   a fun, conceptual edge. The title of one song, “Addis,” meanwhile, nods to her Ethiopian roots. That playful personality extends to the record’s inquisitive sound, as Moolchan extends her post-punk patchwork to include swaggering hip-hop and sun-dazzled lover’s rock.   rattles and slinks and rumbles with an epic wobble. Moolchan raps about Tech Deck skateboards, money, and an obsessed crush: “Holy cow, I never saw a girl like her!” goes one sticky refrain, turning each syllable into a staccato beat. What makes   such a marvel is how Moolchan takes her bigger-sounding influences and casts them into an atmospheric record that doesn’t lose any of the closeness or interiority of her previous recordings, nor their feeling of relative mystery. “I don’t wanna explain,” Moolchan sings on “Ecstasy,” “Running ’round the world with a planet of my own.” For 29 minutes, Moolchan teleports us there, even as she keeps the map a secret.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/sneaks-highway-hypnosis-review"}

His 2010s band Magic Bullets mined both the frenetic jangle of Postcard Records and the wistful melancholy of The Smiths; Terry Malts—whose   was one of our  —frames the rococo stateliness of ‘80s New Romantic music with punk rock’s barbed wire. And with the now two-albums-deep project Business of Dreams (who   made a  ), he explores the moment in UK history when the late-stages of Sarah Records’ cotton-candy indie pop was beginning to give way to the early days of Britpop. Usually, when an artist works from such towering reference points, the music that results has the tendency to feel washed out or derivative, but Cunningham is such an adroit pop scholar—and natural hook writer—that he makes everything feel as if you’re hearing it for the first time. There’s not necessarily anything novel about, say, the big, blurry acoustic guitars and off-in-the-distance vocals that make up  ’s impossibly gorgeous title track, but there doesn’t have to be; Cunningham delivers the song with such effortlessness, and the chorus goes airborne so beautifully, that it’s impossible not to surrender to its charms. It helps that Cunningham’s obsession with pop bleeds into the album’s lyrics, allowing it to act as both container and contents. In the gently-galloping “My Old Town,” he sings about, “The long walk home/ singing songs of the bands you download”; on “I Feel Dread,” which juxtaposes a big, Byrds-ian guitar arpeggio against delay-soaked rhythm guitar, he seeks respite from life’s darkness the only way he knows how: “Headphones on and I’m singing along to Saint Julian,” admitting, “music’s all I’ve got.” And early in the record, after a calliope-like organ line that would do The Clean proud, he sings, “Negativity rules everything around me”; the song, naturally, is named “N.R.E.A.M.” Thematically, the album deals with the idea of release—a necessary next step after the topics that informed the previous Business of Dreams record: the passing of Cunningham’s father and the hiatus from Terry Malts and Magic Bullets that followed. In that light, Cunningham’s obsession with music takes on an almost spiritual component: it’s not just an idle hobby, it’s the silver key that opens the door to freedom and happiness. On  , Cunningham finds his way to that freedom—sometimes slowly, sometimes painfully— in every sun-dappled song. Taking that journey with him is just one of the album’s many, many pleasures.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/business-of-dreams-ripe-for-anarchy-review"}

The twin guitar attack of Meri Haines—also the lead guitarist and singer of equally empowering band  —and Christopher Johnson manages to remain warm and dense even without the addition of bass guitar, resulting in an ample electric shimmer; it reaches a peak on “Shyless,” where Johnson explodes into a nervy, caustic breakdown atop pummeling,  esque instrumentation: “Say goodbye to what you love, I woke up!”  unfolds with five short bursts of deliberate, clearly-workshopped chaos, wrought with stark urgency. Opener “Bubble Tea” creeps in from the cosmic ether with just a few minor chords, then erupts into a lurching, looming wall of noise. Drummer Shawn Gorman’s drum patterns prove especially immersive on this track; the percussionist leans into each cymbal crash with a beginner’s abandon, a tribal sense of propulsion. On “Tambourine,” Johnson sings “I’m so sick of feeling stuck / I’m so sick of waking up,” over one of the record’s many moments of droning, loopy power.

In 1980s Japan, as the country continued to enjoy an unprecedented post-war boom, it became the world’s second-largest economy; companies like Sanyo and Muji pumped cash into the arts to enhance the experiences for its consumers. Across Light in the Attic’s compilation of kankyō ongaku, which translates to “environmental music,” you’ll hear a promo LP for a Sanyo AC unit, a printer commercial, a Seiko watch advert, and the in-store music for Muji. Some of the country’s most famed artists, including Haruomi Hosono, make appearances. Compiled by Visible Cloaks’ Spencer Doran, it’s the first time that any of these recordings have been available outside of Japan. This was Japan’s version of muzak—incidental music used to soundtrack “the spaces, products, and experiences” of that fruitful era. However, stripped back, without the perceived excess of their U.S. equivalent, these minimal experimental soundscapes engaged with a deeper mindset than cheesy elevator jingles. The cover photo by photographer Osamu Murai depicts the work of celebrated architect Fumihiko Maki; the album opener is a serene piano lullaby called “Still Space,” a track that works like a sonic palette cleanser for the mind, where architectural acoustics place emphasis on the quiet spaces between the notes.  offers a sublime meeting of ambient, folk, and natural sounds. Album standouts “Variation III” and “Praying for Mother / Earth Part 1” are trained in the New Age school of ambient that uses environmental sounds to make the listener feel closer to nature; babbling brooks, lapping waves, and chirping birdsong all feel pleasantly surreal. Elsewhere, traditional instrumentation and jazzier, forward-thinking experimentalism collide. On “Ishiura,” a reverie of dancing idiophones makes room for meditation, while “Ear Dreamin” adds synthesized choir voices to a junkyard of organic percussion. With warm rushes of synths, “Seiko 3” is a retro-futurist flirtation with time, while “Blink” suggests a jazzier update of Eric Satie.  ’s long and winding journey through soothing and stirring ambient utopias is an expansive compilation, and one that can help provide shelter from the outside world.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kankyo-ongaku-japanese-ambient-environmental-new-age-music-1980-1990-review"}

On this song, “The Offerings,” “CIYA,” and “Letting Go,” Cross settles into understated grooves, similar to what Makaya McCraven employed on 2018’s  . Much like McCraven, Cross applies a communal approach to his music, sometimes taking a step back to allow other voices to flourish.

Last time around, the Perth band’s art rock experiments were infused with the polished grooves and distinguished, L.A. cool of dance music guru and producer James Ford (whose clients include Arctic Monkeys, Mark Ronson, Foals, and techno alchemist Kevin Saunderson); he also produced and engineered Methyl Ethel’s breakout record, 2017’s  . With these songs, Webb takes notes from Ford’s aesthetic on   while forging his own path toward funky, unconventional pop.  Though Methyl Ethel’s grooves here are the tightest they’ve ever been, the lyrics still skew vague, prioritizing abstract streams of consciousness over traditional narration. “I was alone again, couldn’t see it all,” Webb groans on “Post-Blue.” “It was unfolding forever / And the first light / So light, I held it inside.” At the same time, Webb applies a considerably more methodical approach to the arrangements than on past releases, building them around fragmented keyboard melodies. “Scream Whole” is one such track, a restless pop jam, interwoven with angst-ridden reflections on the power of emotional release. As a result of producing and recording in an intimate, isolated environment, Webb imbues Methyl Ethel’s palette with new, expansive textures. The record’s most danceable songs (“Trip The Mains,” “Ruiner”) are littered with paranoia and anxious lyrical hiccups, subverting the pure pop energy of its frenetic drums and propulsive basslines. Nearly scraped from the record, “Hip Horror” unfolds as an eerie, uptempo pop rock number that taps into the recurring euphoria-turned-hysteria spread across the record writ large. Further demonstrating the record’s divergent moods is Webb’s voice, which holds fast amid all those ambitious runs and risky maneuvers—an impressive feat, given how his delivery ranges from spectral, Thom Yorke-ian bellows to whistling, double harmonic scale falsettos. By splicing hi-fi dance with emotionally-wrought guitar music, Methyl Ethel’s  exploits the common ground between trippy intensity and unmissable melancholy in a fresh, forward-thinking way.", "genre": ["Pop", "indie pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/methyl-ethel-triage-review"}

Such weighty (and wordy) enigmas pepper the lovely, emotionally direct indie pop on  the Seattle quartet’s seventh studio album and first since 2013’s  Formed in 1995 by vocalist/bassist Sean Tollefson and several other since-departed collaborators, Tullycraft were an integral part of the original twee-rock groundswell. Despite outward effervescence in the form of fizzy, noisy guitars and freewheeling vocals, the band favored clever songs that examined the outsider experience—embodied by their  film staple “Pop Songs Your New Boyfriend’s Too Stupid To Know About,” on which the narrator woos a prospective partner by promising superior music taste than that of a new crush. Over the years, Tullycraft evolved toward more straightforward indie pop sweetness, thanks to higher production values and lineup changes that brought vocalist Jenny Mears and guitarist Corianton Hale into the fold. Musically,  ‘s tempos are less frantic than previous LPs, save for “It’s Not Explained, It’s Delaware,” which unfolds at a brisk gallop thanks to crisp guitars and taut rhythms. Yet the album’s slower-paced songs also allow Tullycraft to explore more luxurious arrangements that tease out unexpected bursts of instrumental color. Upbeat horns and ska-leaning rhythms give “Midi Midinette” a deceptively cheerful vibe; “Lost Our Friends to Heavy Metal” is Magnetic Fields-caliber synth-pop; and the organ-kissed, harmony-heavy “Hearts At The Sound” sounds like a lost new wave pop 45. Despite these shifts, Tullycraft’s fondness for elliptical sentence structures and high-powered vocabulary is joyfully intact—the first line of the album rhymes “dishabille” with “glockenspiel”—which leads to smart treatises about navigating relationship implosions, embracing second chances and reconciling regrets. Standout “We Couldn’t Dance To Billy Joel” explores how social and physical expectations are both a boon and hindrance, while “Goldie and the Gingerbreads” is a vivid recollection of the ecstasy and pain of a long-ago fizzled partnership.

It was a difficult time, but also one in which the Afro-Guyanese people endeavored to rediscover their roots.  It was against this backdrop that the Yoruba Singers began playing together. Black-consciousness movements had begun to flourish, and grassroots organizations thrived in their efforts to revitalize African culture. It was while working with one such organization that Eze Rockcliffe founded the Yoruba Singers, and it was in the basement of their offices that the band first started experimenting with cultural presentations of the Afro-Guyanese identity. The Yoruba Singers’ unique aesthetic and sound, which merged Guyanese rhythms, reggae, funk, and afrobeat, combined with their conscious lyrics and appreciation of their African heritage, made them stand out. They haven’t stopped playing since, and this year, the band celebrated their 47  anniversary. Considered by many to be Singers’ masterpiece, the 1981 album   was until recently available only to those willing to cough up hundreds of dollars for an original copy.  Fortunately for the rest of us,   has just reissued the album, which offers a gutsy blend of calypso, funk and afrobeat rhythms. The opening song, “Frustration”, begins with a prominent bass line, sharp drumming, and twangy guitars before bursting forth in a cluster of poly-rhythmic percussion and  jazzy keys, which give way to the funky, reggae-tinged “Revolution Day,” a scathing appraisal of Guyana’s colonial past. The subject of racism and colonialism is also present in the gut-wrenching power-ballad “Bleeding with Hate,” while on the title track, the band sings of their woes over deep, bluesy-funk riffs. The Yoruba Singers continue to tour and make music, but   remains their studio apex, an album that offers a glimpse into the power and pride of Guyana’s Black Consciousness movements.", "genre": ["World", "African"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/yoruba-singers-fighting-for-survival-review"}

Deeply felt details, like the melancholy vocal melodies in “Cliffside,” the swoon-worthy strings in “Mouth to Dust… Waiting,” and the melodramatic closing arc of “Tremendum,” offer glimmers of hope within the gloom. “Scattering Light” is a study in long exposure, a hushed bassline and tiny specks of guitar gradually joined by gentle violin and wreathed by quiet synths. And “We Watched You Disappear” blossoms slowly, strings building gradually, like morning light creeping in through the blinds.

While a few tracks contain wind chimes and birdsong, the album is otherwise built on the sounds of the Buchla synthesizer alone—there’s no guitar, piano, or vocals, let alone the playful mixing that gives some of Smith’s work its verve. She trusts in the instrument to be the source of all evocation, and this honing of her craft was presumably necessary before she could create the colorful synth work that characterizes her later albums. While it offers a curious glimpse into a vital part of Smith’s career,   is also a remarkable album in its own right; each track introduces listeners to a discrete space, letting us rest within its rhythmic swirls. “Tides I,” “II,” and “III” are comforting in their playfulness, their high-pitched tones and wobbling melodies evoking childlike wonder. Others, like “Tides V” and “VIII,” provide monolithic, aqueous atmospheres for listeners to soak in. “Tides IX” is the most notably different, featuring a sustained synth note dissolving into an extended field recording. With that particular transition, Smith posits that the invigorating warmth of these songs can be found in nature itself.

Throwing garage rock, surf, and psychedelic pop into one delightfully lo-fi mix, the seven-track album recalls the warm, radiating vibes of the ’60s and early ’70s, yet the consistent influence of traditional music from Thailand serves to inject its common inspirations with a refreshingly uncommon edge. Charmingly retro tracks like “Jeanmaryn” and “Plankton Bloom” are full of the echoing guitars, wistful harmonies, and perky bass you’d expect from a summery, surf-tinged indie album. But the inclusion of airy keyboards and non-Western scales makes the condensed pop Khana Bierbood offer sound much stranger and more transportive than it has any right to be. The harmonious marrying of East and West may be the most immediate feature of  , but what’s most rewarding about the album is just how well-constructed and compelling its tracks are. Given that Khana Bierbood had been a band for seven years before releasing the record, their songwriting prowess shouldn’t be much of a surprise, but their tuneful and infectious guitar pop feels like a revelation nonetheless. The floating, wide-eyed melodies of “Starshine” linger long after the album’s close, while the raw twang and shimmering vibrato of “Bad Trip” carries an underlying groove that’s hard to resist.

On their new album,  , the group revel in the sounds of the 1970s and ‘80s that would later inspire a thousand rap producers. Teaming up with producer Joseph “Amp” Fiddler, a former George Clinton lieutenant and a one-time mentor to J Dilla, and vocal trio Dames Brown (LaRae Starr, Athena Johnson, and Teresa Marbury), the squad deploy live and electric drums, retro synths, slap bass lines, Fender Rhodes electric pianos, peppy horn sections, and live strings (among many other toys) to lovingly construct eight songs that heavily nod to the disco-soul of Chic, the spaced-out funk of Parliament-Funkadelic, and the talkbox-doused grooves of Zapp. Opener “What It Is” sets the table: the squelchy bass and funky guitar licks have enough velocity to spin a 20-ton disco ball; “Lost Without You” sounds like it shares the same DNA as Chic’s “Good Times.” Amid the floor-fillers, there’s the nastier “Seven Mile,” a blaxploitation-inspired number that’s part Youngblood Priest, part Black Caesar. A certain amount of cynicism is healthy when it comes to artists attempting to recreate old vibrations with this level of specificity, but everyone involved here comes across as either a true veteran—or, at least, the spiritual offspring—of a groovier era.

With her serene, melodious voice and soft, almost staccato guitar playing, Tasha effortlessly moves between soul, bossa nova, and folk to remind listeners that reclaiming downtime, jealously guarding the skin that you live in, and taking care of one another are inherently revolutionary acts. With  Tasha has created a work of power, an album designed to soothe the souls of restless believers—those who dare to imagine a better world for themselves and for others.

And on “2020,” the album’s final track, they look forward, where America will have to confront the failings of the current administration.

In less than six and a half minutes, they tackle doom, death and thrash metal, and even manage to include a jazzy interlude. “Lepidoptera” showcases the band’s technical prowess: drummer Daniel Figueroa joins forces with guitarists Jonathan Miranda and Omar González in an opening that sounds like it might become a hardcore punk rager—that is, until bassist Negrón joins in, churning out hard-hitting grooves that slow the madness down to a doomy trudge.

Some of them were dreamed up whole cloth, the result of utilizing new technologies; others the result of artists finding fresh angles on familiar sounds. Eric Lau, who announced his arrival a decade ago with debut album  , falls into the latter camp, staking out a sound that’s equally indebted to hip-hop and soul. Though its base styles may be familiar, Lau takes them in directions that feel fresh; his is a carefully-crafted sound, one that’s delicately tuned to hit the right frequencies. His new album, billed as the follow-up to last year’s  , makes a virtue of being straightforward. A photo of the man himself adorns the cover—side-on, like the previous installment, but this time lit by a deep blue instead of ochre yellow; the tracks it contains follow a simple format: short and sharp hip-hop instrumentals, delivered in a steady, digestible stream. Lau mixed and engineered Yussef Kamaal’s 2016 debut, and their jazz-funk revivalism has seeped into some of the material here. On “Without A Doubt,” for example, he works electric guitar, undulating synth, and a taut-but-loose drum beat into an electrifying minute and a half—before the song abruptly switches to ethereal drift. There are shades of Grover Washington Jr. in “Mirage,” where jazz flute converses with a wandering bassline. The care that he takes in crafting his beats is especially audible on “Val In Time,” where spare ingredients—piano chords sparring with a looped drum beat—slot together to create a satisfying listen.   is a reminder of the pleasures that can come when simple ideas are masterfully executed.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/eric-lau-examples-volume-two-review"}

The deviation wasn’t so much a schism as it was a pair of concurrent, opposing sea changes, the advents of J-pop and   (otherwise known as Japanese noise music), respectively. Where the former subgenre more or less upheld American hegemony through the incorporation of familiar stylistic and lyrical tropes, the latter presented cultural diffusion as a dissonant, chaotic ritual, lacking an obvious western analogue. And then there were the mysterious Space Streakings, a legion of oddballs (and according to rumor, erstwhile video game programmers) with names like Captain Insect and Karate Condor, who demolished the above binary to transcendent effect through an unprecedented, criminally underrated merger of grindcore percussion, jazz-funk fanfare, industrial effects, screamo vocals, and glitched-out hip-hop—all before suddenly disappearing in the late 1990s, never to be heard from again.  More than two decades after the band’s last output, experimental music bastion Skin Graft (who released much of the band’s recordings, most notably 1994’s Steve Albini-abetted   7”) has brought the maniacs’ whole discography to Bandcamp for the very first time.

Makoto Oshiro’s painstaking remaster gives the disco-inferno energy driving “Dream Dump Island 夢の島” and “Magic Dragon マジックドラゴン,” a long-overdue dynamic boost, while keeping the originals’ unshackled production intact. Indeed, if J-pop represents the bridging of east and west, then Space Streakings’ music is a global superhighway riddled with spike traps and blazing oil spills—and no speed limit or exit ramp in sight.

Daniel Davies, the son of The Kinks’ Dave Davies, fell victim to that struggle on his 2011 debut EP  , which cast him as the lead singer and guitarist of a rock trio. In the following years, however, he found his own voice by helping another,  reclaim his. Davies has been essential to the horror director and composer’s late-career resurgence, touring live and working on Carpenter albums including   and the upcoming new   score. Now with the atmospheric  , Davies has made a debut album that demonstrates his own considerable strength as a composer. Though Davies’s palette is distinct from Carpenter’s icy minimalism, he does conjure some “lost themes” of his own with eerie, proggy soundscapes that could be written for an imaginary horror film. Clouds of ominous synths hover on tracks like “Shadows Alive.” That track begins as a lullaby, built around a delicate harpsichord, before heavier tones fill out the bottom end and the entire song dissolves like a bad dream. Spindly guitars and dark synths dwell on “XXT” but the brisk percussion lifts it with an almost jazzy airiness. “Endless Blue” opens as pure drone, but methodically builds to a cathartic melody. It offers a rare brightness that only makes the rest of  inky darkness more unsettling. The eight tracks over  ’s 31 minutes are all relatively short, but Davies’s vivid productions give the album a greater scope.

That trek had an audible effect on the project’s sophomore LP,  . By culling samples from tour stops across Asia, Australia, North America, and Morocco, Davids and Ivory have created a stunning kaleidoscope of sound which serves not only as a record of the duo’s lived experiences and their inspirations, but a vehicle by which the listener can get in tune with the beauty of the world—as well as with humanity at large. is an album where field recordings commingle with house-style piano melodies, soaring choirs, and samples of everything from Belgian jazz (“Vale”) to obscure ’70s funk-rock (“Turnmills”). It opens with the melancholy “Beginners Luck,” a track with winding, layered vocals that owe as much to Celtic song as its stuttering rhythms do trip-hop; it’s the sole moment of tranquility on an album which otherwise makes good on its title with arrangements flush with euphoria and color. Album standout “Kingdom” is particularly vibrant, leavening its soca-like percussion grooves with darting highlife guitars and a looped flute sample, while “Kāma” unfolds as a synth-heavy dance party, pensive but blissful.

One of his earliest friendships was with Freddie McKay, the rocksteady singer whose work in the early ‘70s combined the sweetness of American soul with the litheness of roots reggae. (It was Fullwood who penned McKay’s 1971 hit “Old Joe”.) A few years later, Fullwood’s journey into Rastafarianism would lead him to cross paths with another titan of the genre: Ras Michael, whose work with the Sons of Negus turns the deep mystique of dub into ritual music for Rasta worship, built around low, bobbing basslines and blissful group chants. So it’s no surprise that Fullwood’s sole record with I-Mo-Jah—the group he formed with Winston McKenzie and Cassandra Jenkins—would reflect both reggae’s soulful and spiritual sides. The record’s credits read like a who’s who of Jamaican music: Leroy “Horsemouth” Wallace and Sly Dunbar provide percussion, Robbie Shakespeare and Aston Barrett turn up on bass; and on trumpet, Burning Spear sideman Bobby Ellis. The all-star class reflects Fullwood’s social circle, but I-Mo-Jah don’t need the help:   is a powerful batch of roots music that was released in 1982 and somehow has never been reissued until the excellent UK label Pressure Sounds stepped in to right that wrong. What’s most gripping about   is the lack of division between the record’s Rasta and rocksteady elements; “Fools Rush In” has the easy groove and pulsing keys of an Alton Ellis love song, but the object of the song’s affection is Divine. Jenkins and Fullwood’s vocals intertwine beautifully on the refrain, occasionally echoing one another, occasionally harmonizing. “Jah Love” has the same low, hypnotic groove that Ras Michael worked with Sons of Negus, but Jenkins darting backing vocals could have been nicked from a ‘60s R&B single. The song is a masterwork of wide-open spaces, occasional bursts of chicken-scratch guitar invading the empty space between the tiptoeing bassline. Album closer “Weeping and Wailing” is a work of wonder: deep, spiritual group vocals punctuating funereal organ stabs and B.B. King-style guitar licks from Steve Goldstein. Out of circulation for far too long,   is a work of divine beauty.", "genre": ["Reggae"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/i-mo-jah-rockers-from-the-land-of-reggae-review"}

Formed in Hobart, Tasmania before relocating to Melbourne, the underground punk quartet played with Bikini Kill, Fugazi, and The White Stripes during their initial lifespan, yet never released anything beyond a few short tapes. Until now. Little Ugly Girls have pulled together recordings new and old for a self-titled collection that stamps a forceful exclamation mark on their cult career. It’s the kind of scalding, squalling record that would get a young band anointed with instant hype. But more importantly, it’s the definitive introduction to an on-again, off-again band that feel every bit as powerful now as they did in the ’90s. The center of gravity is frontwoman Linda Johnston, whose voice swings from an urgent rasp and banshee-level release on opener “Tractor” to a tender whisper on “Storm After Storm.” She’s backed by her brother, guitarist Dannie Johnston, who favors ominous churnings and volcanic surges, alongside the thundering rhythm section of bassist Mindy Mapp and drummer Brent Punshon. Despite the fact that half of the album’s songs finish around the two-minute mark, it’s hard not to be left shaken by the band’s snarling attack. On the album’s longest track, “Vinegar,” Linda leans into the flinty, authoritative mantras that are her signature. “Would you say it’s magic?” she asks a few times, before repeating “Pull out all my hair and smoke my cigarettes” like some dire incantation as the music lurches and circles with mounting power. More devastating, though, is what comes immediately after: The closing “Boxen-Hooda-Hayda” is a bittersweet a cappella number centered around Linda’s doubled vocals. So vulnerable following all that cumulative muscle, her lullaby-esque lyrics make casual reference to family violence, coming at Little Ugly Girls’ recurring subject of personal trauma from a stark new direction.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/little-ugly-girls-self-titled-review"}

Though “Prairie” (cello) and “Lime” (drum machine and processed cello) function as short, relaxing interludes, both are full of character and color.

Deafheaven are often at the center of this conversation, driving a sharp divide between genre purists and those who throw around terms like “post-black metal”—even though the prefix “post-” offers no real insight into what a band might sound like. Not so with San Francisco’s Bosse-de-Nage: this formerly-anonymous quartet “transcend” black metal in a different way, reaching for something more celestial and unbound. On  , Bosse-de-Nage finally break through to the other side, delivering music that borders on transdimensional. They hold true to their signature sound on tracks like opener “The Trench” and “My Shroud,” drawing on black metal go-to’s like tremolo riffs, blast beats, and Brian Manning’s hellish vocals. Often, though, Bosse-de-Nage’s approach leans heavier on jittery post-hardcore than stately Mayhem worship. Portions of “Crux” could easily pass for a hidden gem on some long-lost Dischord compilation: drummer Harry Cantwell frenetically switches from hardcore stylistics to blast beats as Manning wails like a fallen screamo idol, every word throat-shredding and desperate.  is a relentless effort, pausing the chaos but once for a brief instrumental interlude that provides a momentary respite from the ferocity. And while the compositions alone offer more than enough for listeners to dissect, the lyrics elevate the album to brilliance. Structured almost as flash fiction or prose poetry, the words offer haunting glimpses of cosmic horrors, snapshots of places where everything is just wrong. “Once I’m too old to perform even these simple functions my only value will be of the nutritive sort,” Manning intones on “The Trench,” weaving a Kafka-esque tale of a commune’s endless digging.

On  , Brooklyn’s Jordan Lee, aka Mutual Benefit, takes a decidedly softer turn, using those elements of weather as bookends for songs about reaching for love and comfort. Rather than offering flash-bang pyrotechnics, Lee and his band deliver an earthy, slow-burning LP with a cozy, comforting terroir all its own.  Lee chronicles his travails in nature with a light, reedy tenor that floats atop his lush arrangements. With its folk-pop core—typically adorned in tasteful layers of strings and saxophone—  strongly recalls Sufjan Stevens’s classic  if Stevens had chosen to hike the Appalachian Trail rather than study the Prairie State. Indeed, two of Lee’s tracks are Appalachian-adjacent; the sparkling “Mountain’s Shadow” was inspired by North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Parkway, while the gentle, folksier “New History” explores his parents’ roots in Appalachian Ohio. Throughout the record, Lee connects the need to find internal solace examinations of the natural world around him. He opens “Storm Cellar Heart” with lyrics about waking up early enough to see morning glory flowers bloom because a neighbor told him “that it helps to notice the small things.” Later in the track, he nods to a simple gesture that holds a universal appeal: “When you hold me, it’s so much better / It’s enough to drown out the thunder,” he murmurs. Lee closes the record with “Thunder Follows,” which rolls along to rhythms that recall the distant rumble of a faraway storm. “Peace is more than just a season coming around again,” he sings, fingerpicked guitar and faint banjo plinks spiraling down around him in a delicate cascade. It’s a reminder that, though finding peace may not be as effortless as the passing of seasons, it can be a lasting presence.

He’s Big Star meets The Bangles atop Phil Spector percussion (without the specter of evil that now surrounds the latter’s name). And while Nau might be somewhat out of place in a pop market that demands “everything and more, all the time,” in another era—like the one his songs hearken back to—he’s a bona fide star.

Michael Nau’s music is unassuming, straightforward, and quietly subversive—pop structures reimagined and reorganized under the guise of rock ‘n’ roll. There’s a feeling of warmth that radiates outwards from his songs. Perhaps it’s his voice, perhaps the arrangements, but regardless, this effect is quiet, and yet, uniquely powerful; a distinct characteristic of Michael Nau’s music.

That being said, there’s an argument to be made that Martin’s signature works are his collaborations. His duo   with Dag Rosenqvist, and his contribution to the Dronarivm release   with Christoph Berg, are prime examples of the ways chamber instrumentalism and electronic effects can peacefully coexist. Martin’s newest,  , is a different type of creative partnership, one that incorporates both a solo perspective and sympatico connection. The sixth installment of the IIKKI label’s duet series pairs Martin’s cello with the photographs of Yusuf Sevinçli.   captures the transformation of images from sharp reality to the ephemeral presence of dream. Similarly, Martin’s instrumentation traces the slow dissipation of a distinct and present melody into thick harmonic clouds that slowly drift away. And as it was on Martin’s 2018 release , the breadth of instrumental expressionism expands far beyond just the reach of his cello, ranging from roll-up piano to concertina to guitar to glockenspiel. The instrument’s sounds may differ, but they all create a similar state of serenity. The gentle downpour of bells from a singing bowl on “A Child’s Arms Are Moonlight” provides a whispering accompaniment to the cello’s swaying lullaby. The appearance of banjo on “Guarded Eyes Make Curtains Blossom” provides strong resonance, but when it’s eventually bowed, the effect brings it close to the way Martin uses the cello. In “To Stems Unclasped the Petals Cling” the twang, sparkle and sigh of lap steel, ukulele, and cello serve to both complement and contrast.  is a world inside a world, where lively activity exists inside every expression of peacefulness.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/aaron-martin-touch-dissolves-review"}

Bands like Don Caballero, OXES, Drive Like Jehu, Craw, and Dazzling Killmen put angular sounds on the map, then vanished, save for sporadic reunion shows, reissues, or reinventions (like Don Cab’s latter-day second act). Lifers like Shellac and Bellini have pressed on. Kindred spirits of sorts, the Chicago-based, Steve Albini-led trio and the Italian/American four-piece have traced similar paths over the last two decades. Both bands fastidiously—and unapologetically—bang it out, old-school ‘90s-style, offering an off-kilter assault of nails-on-chalkboard riffs, locked-in bass and drums grooves, and speak-scream vocals—part math rock smarts, part post-punk angst with DIY heart-on-sleeve. Nearly 10 years separates Bellini’s   and their latest   and in that period, the veteran unit—with members spread out across the world in Italy, Texas, and New York—sound as tightly knit as ever, ratcheting up the mangled string-bending, ear-piercing dissonance, neck-snapping rhythms and emotive energy that’s been their M.O. since their 2002 debut,  . Fittingly recorded by Albini (he’s presided over every Bellini release since day one),   showcases vocalist Giovanna Cacciola, guitarist Agostino Tilotta, and the rock-solid rhythm section of bassist Matthew Taylor and Girls Against Boys drummer Alexis Fleisig in the finest of jagged and in-your-face form. Caught on tape by Albini back in 2012 but only now seeing the light of day,   runs the gamut, from knotty math-metal and scorched-earth punk rock to psychedelic noise tripping. With spazzy guitars and thrashing beats cranked up to ten on opening track “Greek Fire,” Cacciola—one of the most overlooked and unique singers in underground rock—spews out mostly undecipherable fragmented spit ‘n’ vinegar in her heavy Italian accent. “Don’t be scared / You should not be scared of me,” she wails on “Greek Fire” before launching into rippers like “Clementine Peels,” “Plumber’s Foxtrot,” and “Being Married.” With Shellac gearing up for a late summer/fall tour and Bellini making their triumphant return after a decade-long absence, it’s high time to nerd out on math rock again.", "genre": ["Alternative", "math rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/bellini-before-the-day-has-gone-review"}

As its title suggests, the album is full of songs of both regret and self-doubt, but the group deliver them with some of the strongest power-pop this side of Weezer’s  . The New Zealand quartet—who studied jazz together in Auckland—have a penchant for writing massive choruses that crash like tidal waves, and their songs are as tightly-wrought as they are relentless. On the belligerent breakup track “Uptown Girl,” frontwoman Elizabeth Stokes calls down the wrath of the gods (and a glass of poisoned wine) on a crummy ex as her band yank her from one full-octane hook to another, emphasizing her own frenzied urge to “drink the whole town dry.” Later, in “You Wouldn’t Like Me,” a sunny doo-wop arrangement and crisp backup vocals serve as a foil for Stokes’s harshest self-indictment: “You wouldn’t like me if you saw what was inside me.” But  isn’t all doom and gloom. Stokes knows that falling in love is a gamble, and on the album’s title track in particular, she acknowledges that it’s better to have loved and lost than to be, as she deftly puts it, “happy unhappy.” The Beths know how to dig up both the wounds and the sugar-rush that accompany new romance; on their debut they do so with exceptional gusto.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-beths-future-me-hates-me-review"}

Perhaps it was the latter that has made her adept at translating complex feelings—like desire, loneliness, and desolation, to name a few—into intricately crafted electronic folk compositions. Nothing is gratuitous with Woods. The silences are calculated, the percussion is sparse, reverberating like heavy footsteps in an empty corridor; the synths soar momentarily, then wither away. It’s music that leaves you in a strangely pensive state. That feeling forms the backbone of her debut album,  where the Dublin-based musician carefully uses string arrangements, acoustic guitars, tape fuzz, piano, and synths to soundtrack her journey through grief, self-acceptance, abandonment, and a shape-shifting love. The album opens with “Inhaler,” a track consisting of nothing more than a bare piano, synths, and percussion, showcasing both Woods’s velvety vocals and her poetic prowess. It’s a beautiful song, as unsettling as it is comforting, where Woods deals with the sadness and uncertainty of lost love. On “Inhaler,” the notes are enveloped in echo, a technique that makes her yearning feel that much more palpable. “Kith” is a solemn ballad, anchored by an acoustic guitar and underscored by a barely-there synth line that sounds like the low howl of the wind. The music perfectly echoes lyrics that talk about feeling suffocated and trying to find a place to breathe.  is an album full of such overwhelming moments, where it becomes clear that Woods has been traveling a long, difficult path. But there are also moments of sudden respite: “Jesus Said” is predominantly beat-based, with Woods juxtaposing a delicate classical piano with a dance rhythm, making for a tense listen about emptiness and doubt. On  Woods proves herself to be an accomplished composer, reveling in the nuances and carefully weaving melodies, sounds, and instruments into a sonic landscape that provides a place for comfort and healing—not just for the listener, but for Woods as well.", "genre": ["Ambient", "dark ambient"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/hilary-woods-colt-review"}

The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) remain true originals in the improvised music realm, Tortoise helped put post-rock on the map, and The Flying Luttenbachers birthed “brutal-prog” while U.S. Maple’s “anti-rock” approach drew on no wave and minimalism. Then there’s Chi-town’s long running Cheer-Accident, classification-defying experimentalists who rank somewhere near the top of the “best band you’ve never heard of” list. A tirelessly creative freak-force of nature, C-A have flown under the radar while amassing a staggering 18-album catalog over their three-decade lifespan on the fringes of progressive rock, art-pop, and noise. C-A’s M.O. has been one of constant reinvention, and 2017 was a treasure trove of old and new sounds.   reissued 1999’s angular, herky-jerky and 2000s outings like  , which consists of jagged, jangly pop, and   released , a fresh batch of lush keyboard and horn-driven orchestral post-jazz weirdness. That deep-seated eclecticism and left-field approach is further crystallized on the sparkling—and strangely accessible—new effort  . Sure, the core duo of drummer/vocalist Thymme Jones and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Libersher (augmented by a supergroup of sorts featuring members of Faun Fables, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, and Lovely Little Girls) still journey on dizzying time signature-packed trips, but the 10 exhilarating tunes on  are as infectious as they are spastic. C-A has called it “kraut pop,” a fitting label for the sun-kissed Can-meets-Stereolab grooves that light up  . Right off the bat on the positively earwormy “Done,” C-A settle in on a crisp motorik chug, peppered with synth bass-fueled sci-fi blips and bleeps, space-jazzy hornplay, and dreamy   (courtesy of vocalists Elizabeth Breen and Lindsay Weinberg) cut from the  cloth. From there, it’s all pop-centric, hooks-laden eccentricity, as Jones, Libersher, and company rattle off song after song of fuzzed-out bliss. “The Mind-Body Experience,” anchored by hypnotically metronomic beats, distortion-caked bass plucks, arena-sized guitar riffs and Jones’s airy croon is propulsive and catchy at the same time, while the Dawn McCarthy-sung “Monsters” is just as addictive, and the jewel of bunch. As robotic kraut pop rhythms drive much of   along, C-A manage to fit in a couple of gnarly freak-outs, spazzing out on the zigzagging theatrics of “Last But Not Lost” and the playful, sonic nursey rhymey assault “House of Dowse,” featuring a guest rap turn from hip-hop artist Bethany Schmitt, aka The Buttress.  was one of 2017’s best records and Cheer-Accident have quickly followed up with  , a surefire lock for one of those year-end best-of lists.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/cheer-accident-fades-review"}

Eventually, it’s subsumed by the fast-paced cadence of the drums, the deep, thumping bass, and Sofiane Saidi’s strong but calm vocals. Album opener “Degdega” seems to be designed to make your heart beat faster, translating the feeling of unease into sound. It’s a fitting introduction to a record full of intense energy—hard to define, but immediately palpable thanks to electronic mastermind Sofyann Ben Youssef’s expertly concocted beats. sounds urgent because it is meant to be. Ben Youssef uses a TR-808 to reimagine the many traditional rhythms and instruments of the Maghreb—an area that spans most of Northern Africa, from Mauritania to Libya—through a sci-fi lens in order to warn the region’s dwellers about an impending bleak future, and to spur them into action. By putting instruments like the gasba flute, the zokra bagpipe, and the guembri guitar through the filters of the iconic 808 and bending these sounds into surprising and often unrecognizable forms, Ben Youssef joins the ranks of artists shedding a light on North African futurism by taking a critical and nuanced look at past traditions and remaking them into something that can serve as a window to the region’s unique heritage for the citizens of a distant future. is a wild, intriguing listen; Ben Youssef uses harsh electronic beats as a canvas to constantly criss-cross styles and sounds that don’t typically occupy the same space. Desert blues rhythms coexist with hard rave beats, Algerian raï, targ music from the Bargou valley in Tunisia, and Moroccan gnawa, creating a sound that’s as raucous as it is alluring and illuminating. The standout track “Layli” is a testament as to how all these influences work together. Beginning with a distorted guitar riff, it quickly evolves into an upbeat banger, with hand percussion and distant chiptune blips accompanying renowned Moroccan guembri player and singer Mehdi Nassouli’s game of call and response with the backing choir. After a dizzying break, the track turns into a gabber-influenced banger with an undeniably youthful energy. These juxtapositions between toughness and playfulness run throughout the record with a track like “Ichki Lel Bey” featuring chiptune breaks, and another like “Boganga and Sandia” featuring a beautiful guembri melody looped and layered on top of a resounding bass. Using North African futurism as an outstanding tool, Ben Youssef digs into the Maghreb’s past and present to show the harmony within the differences, and the surprising ways the region can launch traditional Maghrebi culture into the future.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ammar-808-maghreb-united-review"}

On 2013’s  , the Portland-based artist explored folk music history through takes on vintage tunes like “Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “Will The Circle Be Unbroken.” Two years ago, she released  , her soundtrack to an imaginary sci-fi western. Anderson seemed to thrive with these self-imposed boundaries, resulting in textured and often stirring work. For her sixth full-length  , Anderson removes any and all restrictions, and soars even higher as a result. The 10 original compositions are a sundry mix of mood and styles, where the vertiginous blending of multiple guitar lines on “Slow Ascent” fits perfectly between the minimalist skronk of “Angel’s Rest” and the reverb-heavy ramble of album opener “Pulse.” Anderson also opens her process to some additional instrumentation, like the quiet electric piano that makes its presence known on the stinging ballad “Lament.” That piano bobs up again on the album’s closing song “Lift,” joined by a steady pattern played on a requinto jarocho, a guitar-shaped instrument originating from Mexico. Those little inclusions may not seem monumental. But for Anderson, whose domain has typically remained in the finger-picked guitars and lap steel, her decision to bring in new timbres and details into her sound is the mark of an artist who knows that unless she pushes herself to evolve, her work will surely stagnate and molder.

The New York trio’s fourth album,  , builds on the off-the-cuff humor that populated their first three, piling on sung/screamed lyrics and sour guitar chords with an irreverent glee. It’s the longest record they’ve ever released, and also their most considered—for the first time, Palberta actually edited their songs after laying them to tape. But that doesn’t diminish the feeling of immediacy that has become the group’s trademark. The three women of Palberta—Ani Ivry-Block, Lily Konigsberg, and Nina Ryser—all sing, often at once, on the band’s songs, which reinforces the impression of a tight-knit group of friends hanging out and goofing off. Despite the surface levity, several tracks on the record weave in a little darkness. “Who are you when you have nothing?” they sing on “Jaws’ Return”; on the slow, nearly mournful “Momentous Space-Up,” they bemoan “having a dream drop.” But the album’s most addictive songs tend to be the ones where the tempo and the snark run high. “Sound of the Beat,” with its repeated “heys!” and drifting guitar lines, somehow lands in the exact middle between The Go-Go’s “We Got the Beat” and the  theme song, while album closer “Heaven to Rock n’ Roll” pokes fun at the artifice of Palberta’s technical status as a rock group. “Satellite! / Coming from the heavens of rock ‘n’ roll!” they yelp over a jagged bassline, simultaneously highlighting the silliness of their dude-dominated genre and establishing them as part of it. Rock, after all, tends to be best when it’s loose and fun, not overly polished or fixated on virtuosity.

In the four years that followed, he’s split his time between working as a  , and working out his demons over intimate keyboard arrangements.   brings the two Zhangs together, digitally reworking “failed” (in his own words) saxophone compositions into brooding oceanic ambience that’s been processed out of recognition. Opening track “Pierrot” scatters mournful notes from the man’s horn into a cavernous echo chamber, while lonely piano chords bristle underneath. It’s a compelling facade, Zhang playing up his role as the lonely sufferer namechecked in the track’s title, splitting his turmoil into scattered sax. Elsewhere on the record, Zhang moves even more slowly, recalling Popol Vuh at their keyboard choir peak. Zhang has been performing under his own name for four years now, and the music he’s created feels more honest; spiritual panic is now firmly at the core of Zhang’s solo work. His own mixed background—coming in some way from Canada, Taiwan, and the U.S. all at once—has already been a key driver for the artist, but a few years of traveling the world and improvising with new instrumentation now make it seem as if he’s left planet Earth behind altogether. The celestial scope hinted at in the album’s title fully emerges during the vast 20-minute title track that closes the album, a monstrous cavalcade of overlapping organs.

Second track “Isolation” opens with a galloping assault, and its vocal hooks are built for singalongs; the guitars weave their way down wildly varying yet occasionally intertwining paths. “How could I pray for salvation / When I’m the only mourner yet to grieve?” hardly sounds fun on paper, but shouted along, it becomes surprisingly exultant. “Flesh To Nothing” ascends to grand heights with heavily-layered vocals that alternate between growled and triumphant, peaking with a massive solo after a slow-building tremolo section. The growled vocals do occasionally misfire—“Maw Of Time” is somewhat grating—but the integration is far stronger here than it was on their two previous records.  ends on a subdued note with the mournful, nine-and-a-half minute “From Ruin,” the most straightforward epic-doom song of the lot.

Geddes Gengras, with their droopy moustaches and bright print shirts, may look like archetypal laid-back L.A. scenesters—but both have a preposterous work ethic in a wide variety of sounds, including, lately, reggae. Since 2011, when they tracked down vintage Rasta vocal group The Congos in Portmore, Jamaica to make the album that would become , they have built an intimate relationship with the island and its music that puts dilettante appropriators of Jamaican music to shame. The duo have found time to strengthen personal connections across the island over repeated visits—recording vocalists like Fyah Flames, Cerassietea, Lukan I, and many more—making vivid episodic films of their travels and sessions, and finally establishing a studio of their own there. This collaboration, with the British label Bokeh Versions, is the latest fruit of this work: consisting of “80% new” tracks,  pairs vocals from Sikka Rymes, I Jahbar, Early One, Lyrical Wiz, Sniper, Buddy Don, and Lopo with beats from Duppy Gun’s California musical family (D/P/I, Butchy Fuego, Big Flyte & Velkro, and Ras G) with Bokeh’s (Jay Glass Dubs, Seekersinternational, Abu Ama). This tape, as much as any of their releases, demonstrates the sincerity of their relationship to Jamaican music; Duppy Gun is connected to the island’s sounds on an elemental level. With every siren, distorted kick, and echo that refuses to die, there’s a clear understanding of the sonic dialects of reggae and dub that are impossible to fake. Whether it’s the sonic storm of “Mad” held together by I Jahbar and Early One’s rapid-fire chat, or the vintage Dembow-style beat of “Filet Mignon” underpinning Lopo’s melodic chant, this wild, ragged, brutally stoned mix is rooted in dancehall’s untold variety and innate joyous derangement.", "genre": ["Reggae", "dancehall", "ragga"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/duppy-gun-productions-miro-tape-review"}

Words like “vlk” (wolf), “prst” (finger), and “krk” (throat) sound more like guttural cries to an English-language ear.

Hailing from the city of Brno, “Czechoslovak” band   (half of them come from Slovakia and the other half from the Czech Republic) are a potent example of the genre. Their debut album  is a collection of powerful, rasping stoner rock riffs shot through with a sense of pure evil. Singer Jana Kremace alternates between lyrics in English and Czech, but always screams with the same demonic intensity. “Observing dust / Mechanically trapped / In pleasant void,” she fiercely spouts over the rhythmic yet rotten guitar riff of “Set a Distant Lie,” and it almost sounds as if she’s describing the sound of her own band. Not only are Nikander great at writing tense tracks built on the repetition of a certain riff or pattern, they also sagely mix epic hellbound rides (“Ve stínu val”) with powerful doom metal flare-ups that sound like they could easily shatter the ground underneath the band to reveal dirt and tar pits (“Steel Willows”), and slower moments dense with an Om-reminiscent atmosphere (“Farewell”).

And there is something enchanting in Yamada’s voice, which floats through her synthesized universe as if a natural extension of the computerized ecosystem she’s created.

Operating in a similar terrain as Arca (another artist preoccupied with biomorphic forms and digital alchemy), Devi stretches the tropes of dance music—icy trance stabs, seismic 808 kicks, percussive cycles of tension and release—into shapes that dangle on the edge of total dissolution. Instead of basslines, she deals in vast, gelatinous sheets of buzz; instead of beats, there are concussive blasts trailing long, glassy reverb tails. She can be disarmingly sweet: “Intentional Dreams” is a weightless ballad in which pitch-shifted, harmonized voices are smeared like iridescent gel; in “Genesis of Ohm,” rubbery arpeggios and eerily-processed vocals recall the Knife’s 2006 album  .

Critically adored and certainly renowned among a faithful audience of listeners—many of whom (like myself) have been following her since her days as a member of the industrial group Ethyl Meatplow and the warped alt-country outfit Geraldine Fibbers—she still rarely shows up in regular discussions of some of the most unique and consistent voices to emerge from the ‘90s underground, or of the most talented musicians and arrangers in experimental music today. And her work carries great emotional heft and immediacy, too, in a way that heady experimentation often struggles with; it often seems to come from some raw rift in the heart, full of the ugliness of loss and grief and alienation. Part of this, surely, is that her music ranges wide across a number of styles but bends them all in to a very specific aesthetic—which can often be harsh and confrontational to the ear (especially when she’s playing with her band Evangelista), but does not have any of the pummeling, unrelenting genre conventions of much of the noise scene. She brings in her beloved country music (see her  , with Nels Cline, for this impulse in its purest form), gospel (which, of course, helped birth both country and blues), and sly nods to pop music from the ‘50s through the ‘70s. And though she has such a firm sense of herself and her sonic range, she’s never afraid to explore new territory or to collaborate with real equanimity with any number of fellow musicians. Her latest,  —a fairly easily approachable record in the Bozulich oeuvre, as was her last,  —is full of honored guests. John Eichenseer, aka  , contributes to two of the album’s most striking pieces: the opener “Let it Roll” (on which another experimental stalwart,  , plays drums) and “Stained in Grace.” “Let it Roll” is positively spiritual, with duduk and bells conjuring a meditative state that’s both intimate and highly ritualized, as the most meaningful religious services are.   joins in on “Written in Smoke,” creating sharp terrain with caustic guitar work for Bozulich’s dreamy growl to explore. The Night Porter—Bozulich’s group with Shahzad Ismaily, Jessica Catron, and Ches Smith—assembles for “Sha Sha,” a true creepout that stretches, malforms, and grinds up sunny pop idioms with metallic grace. The legendary Marc Ribot co-wrote “End of the World,” which posits that we’ll go out not with a bang or a whimper but a slow, deadly groan; he also appears on “Emilia,” as does cellist  , who co-wrote that beautiful, aching piece. Hopefully, this gorgeous album, which deserves to have time spent with it in the same way all of Bozulich’s work does, will get her one step further to the center of the conversation when it comes to lifetime achievement in the experimental world.", "genre": ["Experimental"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/carla-bozulich-quieter-review"}

Menacing distortion on his guitar, false starts and unexpected hiccups in his compositions, a touring drummer that often sounds like he’s just strolled in from  —all of these surprises add an edge to his songs that steer him clear of the tropes of standard indie-folk fare. The new Shakey Graves record   is Rose-Garcia’s biggest curveball yet. He has largely moved his gnarled guitar figures to the back of the mix (and in some cases, done away with them entirely), opting instead to welcome a wide range of pop-influenced stylings into his arrangements (“I could only deny the inevitable for so long,” he has quipped about his newfound interest in the Beatles and Harry Nilsson). As a result,   radiates a technicolor glow throughout. “Dining Alone” boasts a giddy chorus that nails Olivia Tremor Control’s penchant for polished melody; later, “Mansion Door” shines with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young harmonies and “Climb on the Cross” effortlessly evokes contemporary psych-pop acts like Foxygen with its humid production and retro synths. Intriguingly, Rose-Garcia uses these backdrops to deliver some of his most somber and topical commentary yet. Threaded through the album are nods to contemporary populism (“Pinch every penny and stroll to the bank / Beg for a loan on my humble estate,” he sings on “Excuses”), the sad realities of aging (“Tin Man”), and even a sharp critique of Islamophobia on “My Neighbor.” Shakey Graves has always frayed the edges of folk music, but on  , Rose-Garcia rips them up entirely, and reaps the rewards.", "genre": ["Alternative", "Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-shakey-graves-cant-wake-up"}

Though the band’s sound is easily recognizable, each subsequent release also brings something new to the table, not only because members Chip King and Lee Buford have built their songs more and more around samples and synthesized drums as their project has progressed, but also because they’ve opened their creative doors to countless other musicians. More than half of The Body’s releases are full-on collaborations with other bands—like   and  —and even albums credited to just “The Body” include a plurality of voices beyond King’s and Buford’s. It’s no surprise, then, that the first voice we hear on the group’s latest,  , doesn’t belong to either of the band’s core members but to Assembly of Light Choir’s Chrissy Wolpert, whose elegiac vocal enters near the end of the quiet, fraying first track. It isn’t until track two, “Can Carry No Weight,” that we hear King’s trademark, razor-like wail; when we do, it’s set in the background of the mix, chopped and manipulated under Kristin Hayter of  ’s lead vocal and anchored by a muted four-on-the-floor beat. This interplay is telling: on  , King and Buford take on the role of being contemporary metal’s Sly & Robbie. They focus their energy on rhythm, texture, and structure, sampling their own distinct sound—the booming percussion, in-the-red distortion, King’s voice—such that it becomes a sonic foundation for their collaborators to build upon. This results in frequent, affecting tonal shifts. The first two-thirds of “An Urn” display the duo’s varied toolbox: grinding noise, a synthesized beat, abstract howls, a fleeting, dancehall-ish melody line. Once they set the stage, Hayter comes in, screaming a monologue that, against an stop-start acoustic drumbeat, matches  ’s somber register but adds a personalized sense of urgency.", "genre": ["Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-the-body-i-have-fought-against-it-but-i-cant-any-longer"}

To that end,   is more eclectic than Bag’s 2016 self-titled effort. (Both albums were produced by Lysa Flores.) Brash horns punctuate the upbeat soul-rocker “Stranger,” “Sparkling Path” boasts twitching guitars that are twisted into post-punk contortions, and “Shame Game” is a disco-blues strut driven by funky piano and slippery grooves. The vulnerable “Adrift” is even more stunning: It’s a queasy breakup waltz with plaintive piano, melancholy cello accents, and Bag’s brassy vibrato. As that song demonstrates, Bag’s ability to zero in on (and dissect) emotional, physical, and political turmoil is key to  ’s power. “Invisible” describes a man losing himself to alcohol dependency, while “77,” a churning girl-group punk cyclone bolstered by invective from Kathleen Hanna and Bratmobile’s Allison Wolfe, is an unsparing condemnation of income inequality—specifically, how a woman makes 77 cents to every dollar a man makes: “It’s not right / It’s bad for women / And worse if you’re not white.” ’s moving closing track, “White Justice,” is even more incisive. Bag wrote the song about the 1970 Chicano Moratorium, a peaceful Mexican-American-driven anti-Vietnam War protest turned deadly after police intervention. At the end of the tune, she links this tragedy to the fact that the decades-old “struggle” is still relevant today. “You say justice is colorblind / I know you’re lying,” she sings, before leaning forcefully into the line, “White justice is a travesty.” Despite these somber moments,   ripples with optimism. Of note is the hollering pogo “Turn It Up,” which advises that it’s never too late to shed toxic and dishonest people (if not your own baggage), and start over: “You made a playlist and it’s locked into your head / Toss it out, play something new instead.” On  , Bag asserts that change is necessary—but, perhaps more important, she also believes it’s possible.", "genre": ["Alternative", "punk rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/alice-bag-blueprint-review"}

It would have been hard to predict in advance how things would have turned out: Both acts tend to approach their mostly-electronic compositions playfully, with Wong and Minekawa favoring to regular patterns and cute melodies, and Good Willsmith opting for the abstract, their improvised free-for-alls ping-ponging all over the place, full of delirious mischief. Combined, they could have easily amplified one another’s kookier aspects and ended up with something both overstimulated and overstimulating. Instead, by some miraculous alchemical reaction, each has brought out the vivid beauty in the other. This is, very simply, a gorgeous record. There are some tangible reference points: a motorik krautrock beat underpinning “The Garden of Earthly Flanger”; some freaky vocal processing in “Aiの名” that recalls the post-Arca school of contemporary electronica; a particular interaction between the cymbals and high-frequency synths on “擬感情物語” that feels descended from early ‘90s Underground Resistance and Carl Craig. Here and there, you might hear hints of The Necks’ slo-mo jams, or The Orb at their best and most intergalactic. But more often, you won’t even notice the lineage, because the sound consistently transcends not only influence, but its own immediate sources: you won’t know whether what you’re hearing is organic or electronic, but it hardly matters, because the result is simply blissful.

Their latest album,  , is Beach House at their most restless, exploring new musical terrain while remaining rooted in their core sound. It’s not a sleight to say that the most exciting songs on   distantly resemble older Beach House songs. On lead single “Lemon Glow,” the duo pushes the arena-leaning anthemics of  ’s “Wishes” into a deep groove, maybe the first straight-up  in the band’s catalog. The spastic, jittering synths that introduce “Drunk in LA” sound ripped from a Neon Indian song, but  ’s eerie sense of sorrow manifests itself in Legrand’s slowly unfurling vocals and abstract, devastating lyrics. Scally’s use of acoustic guitar on “Lose Your Smile” is unprecedented in Beach House’s catalog, but the wail of a slide guitar on the song’s outro recalls the intro of debut single “Apple Orchard.” “L’Inconnue” is partially sung in French, and it’s one of two tracks to boast a mid-song tempo change, but its organ-led, bleak ambience would feel at home on  . Lyrically,  mostly sticks to the group’s established topics: the darker parts of the human mind, the desolate undercurrents of romance. On   Legrand leans into the lyrical abstractions that have guided her since  ; through her words, she pushes Beach House even further in the metaphysical direction toward which it’s been heading. Present as ever, though, is the haunting, enveloping aura that’s defined the band from day one.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/beach-house-7-review"}

The Detroit pianist was hardly alone, of course—but the first two albums by Cox’s Contemporary Jazz Quintet (released on Blue Note in 1968-69) may have picked up the gauntlet of Davis’s great ‘60s quintet more firmly than any other jazz band of the time. The Quintet’s third album,  , didn’t come until 1973—on Cox’s own Strata Records, its inaugural release—and by that time, Cox had learned the lessons of   and  , too.  reshaped those lessons, however. Bassist Ron Brooks retains his upright acoustic, replacing aggressive funk with a steady thrum that becomes nearly subliminal beneath Cox’s electric piano, trumpeter Charles Moore and saxophonist Leon Henderson’s horns, and Danny Spencer or Bud Spangler’s percussions. The drummers, too, deviate from Davis’s fusion template: They have the longer-distance miking and thudding low-end, but hew closer to conventional swing, even if—as on “Nzugo Saba (Struggle)”—it’s lightning fast. Two tracks, “Tao” and “Inner Beckoning,” come closer than the others to funk, featuring guitarist Ron English, who strongly echoes John McLaughlin. There are throbbing grooves and some electronic processing of trumpet and bass on “Inner Beckoning,” though the track is more hesitant in its pacing. The Quintet abhors clutter—“Tao” keeps to a clean, easy groove, such that even when Spangler builds into a trap-kit frenzy, the others mainly just stay out of his way. The resulting rhythmic and textural approach sometimes hints at Damo Suzuki-era Can, a contemporary of the Quintet, and one whom Cox likely hadn’t then heard. More to the point, though,   is a thoughtful, fascinating example of Cox as a keen observer of the cutting edge, understanding it before most of the world had caught up—and having the confidence to take it his own way.  ", "genre": ["Jazz", "free jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-contemporary-jazz-quintet-location-album-review"}

For just about any other band, this would be indulgent at best, suicidal at worst. But the fact that   seems to sprawl into infinity is appropriate: this is the kind of music that needs room to breathe. Its six songs don’t play out so much as they  , slouching on slow-motion chord explosions toward gloriously crestfallen climaxes. And while the imperial instrumentals “The Indwelling Ascent” and the acoustically-driven title track—both bejeweled with gorgeous, twin guitar harmonies—breeze by at a mere 3:11 and 5:49 respectively, the other four songs push up against the 20-minute mark. In other words, if you’re looking for a quick metal fix, this might not be the album for you. But to pass on   would be to miss out on some of the most majestic music being created today. Glacially-paced and gilded with crystalline melodies, thundering epics like “Whispering Spiritscapes” and “Scripture Of Exaltation and Punishment” seem to emanate from some cavernous pit in the Earth’s molten core. Vocalist/guitarist Damon Good’s spectral moan rumbles like some ominous warning from beyond the grave, and the lead guitars sound as though they’ve been beamed down from the far reaches of the galaxy. The forlorn organ intro of “The Rubaiyat”—a reference to Persian quatrains—gives way to a booming vocal incantation and more of those gorgeous guitars. In the end,   feels like a meeting point between the furthest reaches of the galaxy and the deepest recesses of planet Earth, but its origins are ultimately beside the point.

The core of the ensemble—bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Tomas Fujiwara—work with her in the long-running collective  . That agile rhythm section comfortably accommodates her new partners, singer  , who also leads the fascinating group Elder Ones on an exploration of free jazz and Carnatic music, and trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, a master who increasingly subverts his deep post-bop roots with ambitious compositional and conceptual conceits. As with many of Halvorson’s bands, the music is marked by fluid contortions and tart harmonies, and the arrangements employ both zigzagging unison lines and rich counterpoint. The performances are rooted in jazz, even if the rhythmic figures sometimes reflect her admiration for art rock,    . Kidambi’s singing ranges widely, sometimes articulating melodies with unfussy directness, sometimes engaging in improvisatory swoops and curlicues. Halvorson’s poetic lyrics are rich in imagery and, as the album title suggests, coded meaning, and their seductive elusiveness provides plenty of food for thought. But the greatest pleasure comes from the way Kidambi’s voice and the playing of Halvorson and Akinmusire dig into the sensual crags, slaloming grooves, and beautifully knotted lyric tangles of the music.

About halfway through  ’s title track, he describes performing “these death songs to a bunch of young people on drugs” at a music festival, talking with fellow artists about songwriting, before noting that “to be alive felt so absurd.” Then comes the track’s gently melodic chorus, which begins, “People get cancer and die.” As that line indicates,   makes much use of surprise—emotional transitions happen quickly, as the dark wash of guitar on “Tintin in Tibet” makes way for a fingerpicked passage, above which Elverum recounts early romance with Castrée.  ’s unpredictability feels like a mirror of Elverum’s internal disorientation, finding reminders of his wife in unlikely places—while traveling, playing in his yard, making his daughter breakfast. On “Distortion,” he wonders, “Is it my job now to hold whatever’s left of you for all time?” Elverum is too honest on   to offer an answer to that question, but as “Distortion” nears its conclusion, he offers something softer and warmer: “In his tears right now,” he sings, “light gleams.”", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mount-eerie-now-only-review"}

The group released their self-titled debut in September of last year, and followed with a live album, recorded at the Crypt of St. Giles Church in South London. Born in the same Hoxa HQ Studio in Hampstead as their first LP,   also shares that record’s fondness for improvisation. This wasn’t part of the plan; the band initially intended to record music they’d written beforehand, but soon realized upon entering Hoxa for the second time that their power lay in spontaneity and musical freedom. The LP opens with “Djinn,” a meditative piece of mystical jazz where Leon Brichard’s simple, repeated bass motif and Satin Singh’s evocative percussion create space for Idris Rahman’s soaring saxophone. “Nada Brahma,” full of atmosphere and suggestion, also takes repetition as its starting point. There are touches of Indonesian gamelan in Brichard’s bass harmonics before Rahman’s sax and Emre Ramazanoglu’s drums explore more abstract terrain. The transitions between quiet, meditative passages and head-nodding energetic peaks is even more evident on “Delusion,” a monstrous slab of drum-&-bass-meets-jazz-fusion that lands the quartet somewhere between ‘90s Photek and  -era Miles Davis.

Much of the output from this especially fertile period of Bell’s career has been collected in this double-LP set from Drawing Room records, which consists of nearly everything she released in 1995: her second full-length album,   along with the material from two 7” singles (the  EP and “Angel”/“ ”). Bell expresses herself primarily with scraggly guitar chords, which are either overdriven with distortion or dusted by a phase shifter. It’s psychedelic but grounded, like a microdose that sharpens the senses and makes colors a little more vivid. The spell is broken only by dramatic shifts in volume and tone. “History” shimmers blithely before a blast of “Sister Ray”-like guitar lightning. And the marvelous “Caitlan” strips everything down to an indelicate piano line and the groans and scrapes of a cello. These are songs of restlessness, a mood amplified by Bell’s use of language. Like Life Without Buildings frontwoman Sue Tompkins, she gets stuck on one turn of phrase or sentence, repeating it multiple times with the emphasis landing in different places. The lyrics speak of constant movement (by foot or by car), spiritual unrest, and an inability to meet another person’s gaze.

Although  , the band’s latest and fifth full-length album, retains its predecessor’s unorthodoxy, it also derives seething energy from looking backward. On  , Portal trade  ’s richness for a messier, DIY sound that recalls early death metal groups like   and  , who, in their infancy, kept their compositions comparatively simple and their production lo-fi. Never imitative, though, Portal access the foundational simplicity of their forebears in order to, across  ’s tight 37 minutes, articulate a distinct language steeped in their own mythology. ’s nine tracks lack defined structures—they’re distorted, abrupt, and sometimes entirely without melody. Following a two-minute ambient intro, tracks two and three—“ESP ION AGE” and “Husk”—flit between death metal tropes and fuzzy atmospherics, with Portal using new compositional ideas almost algorithmically, as if reprogramming the genre from its source code. Throughout  , vocalist The Curator emits monotonic growls atop recharging musical backdrops; guitars saw through the mix, ascending and descending at hardcore speeds without stopping on recognizable riffs. “Phreqs” exacerbates  ’s relationship with time: Progressing chaotically yet with an ineffable logic, the song slips out of reach in its second half. The mythology that complements Portal’s idiosyncratic musical language is called the “Olde Guarde,” also the title of  ’s nearly 10-minute closer. About halfway through, the song’s metallic churn is replaced by a  -like mix of phonograph crackles, cinematic hums, and wordless, tuneful moaning. Breaking with their own template, Portal offer a perplexing but decidedly human capstone—a living voice making its way through an electric musical landscape. The Olde Guarde employs elemental language (“ions,” “volts,” “spores”) and looks to first-generation technology; on  , this pseudoscientific language connects to an originary death metal spirit in service of something both abstract and alive.", "genre": ["Metal", "Death Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/portal-ion-review"}

But rather than sticking faithfully to any previous iterations of the song, Mahal takes the title as an instruction, using the track to demonstrate her formidable pop skills. It opens with a jazzy guitar progression before Mahal locks into a tight duet with a subtle organ line. Her vocals on the song are breathtaking, and her take on “Giant Step” is inspirational without ever becoming saccharine, with an invigorating guitar solo that kicks open the door into a final, triumphant chorus. That ease and skill shows up throughout  : instrumental interludes become vibrant plays on old spirituals; jazz chords get tangled up in funk grooves and soaring vocal melodies, and downcast ballads become anthems of power thanks to Mahal’s commanding vocals.  is awash in gorgeous vocals, inventive instrumentals, and has a distinct feel for exploring the more interesting crevices of pop music. “Can’t Call it Love” opens with a crunching guitar riff as Mahal sings, “I’m feeling new like an old-school instrumental / I’m getting in the mood / And feeling sentimental.” There’s a deliberate assertiveness to that lyric, subtly underscoring Mahal’s confidence in her own talent, and her ability to bend familiar styles into something new. Transformation is a theme throughout   On “Dream,” over moody, wavy guitar lines, Mahal laments a lost love, but also expresses the joy that comes from moving on. “Optimist” bolsters a ripping organ riff with live hip-hop drums and a group of background vocalists who echo every word Mahal sings; it’s a tour de force. “It’s Down To You” takes a thick, atmospheric guitar line and pairs it with a wraith-like organ to accent Mahal’s defiant lyrics: “I won’t be the only one to lay my life on the line,” she tells an unnamed lover. is full of affirmations like this, that Mahal is—and all of us are—strong enough to do what we’re afraid of. It’s easy for that idea to read as overly sentimental, but the album is full of such passion, belief, and beauty that Mahal never feels anything less that wholly convincing. On “Dream,” she sings of being able to “tell the truth from the make-believe.” On  , she separates fact from fiction again and again, and delivers truth with inspiring conviction.", "genre": ["Pop", "Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/deva-mahal-run-deep-review"}

After the band broke up in the late ‘00s, de Jong made his solo debut in 2015 with  a record that could be considered a continuation of The Books’ sound. It showcased de Jong doing what he knows best, pulling samples from his meticulously curated record collection, and adding a joyous mixture of pop, jazz, and sounds made with everyday household items. It was a wondrous record with an uncanny joie de vivre that’s hard to describe. His new album,  is a completely different affair. Gone is the sense of amazement and curiosity that distinguished  replaced by raw, slightly unhinged, and complex experimental tracks that focus less on melody and more on translating feelings like loss, grief, doubt, anger, frustration, and confusion into sound. It’s telling that de Jong begins the journey with “Embowelment,” a track with a backbone of a chorus of voices screaming in rage—sometimes looped in reverse—atop syncopated drumming, acoustic guitar melodies, and synths. It’s an overwhelming composition that functions as a harbinger of the emotional purging to come. Arranged into a sequence,  ’s 14 tracks tell vivid tales of modern anxieties: the need for success, the viscerality of heartbreak, the inevitability of disappointment. (The dogmatic positivity in the spoken word passages of “Doings,” “Dimples,” “Almost Doomed,” and “Doomed” wryly underscore the album’s main thrust.) There are moments of respite—like “Pipe Dream,” a rare quiet track full of blips and tones—but they don’t last long. The record ends with the violence of “Breaking Up,” a track that recalls the screaming chorus of “Embowelment,” with its fury laser-focused on a cheating lover. Balanced atop a plucking, tuneless guitar, the track quickly devolves into instability. is de Jong in an even more fearless form, with nothing to lose but darkness, anger, and despair.

Punk rock, they explain, soundtracked much of Spain’s early ’80s, when the country was still emerging as a democracy. But punk was largely commandeered by the record industry and made safe for mass consumption. The country’s true sonic rebels, they explain, were pioneers of electronic music—a few of whom achieved success, most of whom toiled in obscurity. ’s first two tracks set the stage for just how far-flung a compilation this is. Prolific Madrid industrial act Esplendor Geométrico, who self-released and distributed their cassettes in the early ’80s, open things up with “Moscú Está Helado.” It’s a severe dance jam that’s a bit of an anomaly among the group’s early ambient sound experiments—cassettes of which the duo both self-released and distributed to their cult audience. The second track, Zombies’ “Extraños Juegos,” is at the other end of the musical spectrum—a candy-coated, reverb-heavy surf pop tune with robotic drumming and chaotic synth interludes. Unlike Esplendor Geométrico, Zombies signed to RCA and experienced considerable mainstream success in Spain before their untimely disintegration. There are some familiar sounds here: TodoTodo’s “Autogas” is a funky twist on Kraftwerk, while De Picnic’s “Jeanette Me Quiere” and La Fura Dels Baus’ “Mareâ” sound reminiscent of Afrika Bambaataa or Herbie Hancock tracks from around the same era. More often, though, this is music that brims with explosive possibility. Derribos Arias’s “A Flúor,” one of their two excellent contributions, is a particularly gorgeous soundscape that nods at dub, punk, and flamenco. Diseño Corbusier’s tracks are minimal and focused, employing bulbous synths that echo across the full stereo spectrum (it’s easy to see why they’ve been rediscovered and celebrated in recent years). And El Humano Marrano’s “Himno” is a raw and youthful slice of punk energy—it sounds like Domi Delgado jogging in place while he sings—channeled through syncopated blips and bleeps. Many of  ’s artists were using the same new drum machines and synthesizers in their music, but they set off in any number of exciting directions.

While the culinary style was, at the time, an ingenious (and somewhat desperate) adaptation to the harsh economic conditions in Europe at the time, Rossi has taken it more as a philosophical inspiration. Her ethos is doing more with less, eschewing the use of the fancy equipment normally associated with experimental electronic music production and instead creating compositions out of simple elements: found sounds she records in her home, and on walks around the Scottish metropolis; minimalist synths, sparse percussion, and layered harmonies she creates with her own voice. The results are ethereal, meditative and, upon closer listens, slightly spiritual.  In that way,  Cucina Povera’s debut album, is a powerful study in limits. By using a deliberately restricted sonic palette, she directs the listener towards the beauty, the sadness, and the surprise that can be found in the most mundane details. The opener, “Demetra,” is built around two looped samples: one of Rossi hissing into a microphone and another of her harmonizing with herself. She shrouds these elements in reverb and complements them with a crescendo synth line that eventually fades into—like most of her compositions—silence. The follow-up track, “Kuparirumpu,” features a solo-choir with three distinct melodies that seem to expand and contract throughout the song, all of them in a tense competition with Rossi’s vocalizations. She follows this path—building around natural elements—throughout most of  using the spellbinding effects of chants and repetition to paint a picture of bucolic simplicity and strange, fraught beauty. Throughout the album, Rossi takes advantage of the possibilities of darkness and the heavier aspects of minimal electronic music. “Avainsana” is a mind-bending trip, where she lures the listener in with a haunting, low-end synth line and a looped sample of what sounds like water leaking into a metal sink. Her voice then clears the way for a techno kick drum, which falls by the wayside just before the song ends. “Totean,” the album closer, is an outlier, resting primarily on low-frequency oscillators and ending with Rossi sporadically speaking. With  Rossi seems to want us to follow her into a game of possibilities, where even the smallest sounds can nourish the soul, if only we’d let them.", "genre": ["Electronic", "avant-garde"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/cucina-povera-hilja-review"}

But as the group convened in Lagos’ Decca Studios for several months, they found themselves suddenly exploring a much more modern, thoroughly global sound than they had on their first two records, thanks in large part to their latest collaborator Themba Matebese, a noted Lagos-based South African producer who grew up in London. Matebese added a flurry of synths and keyboards to a sound nevertheless deeply rooted in twin brothers Joe and John Nyaku’s rhythm section, helping Basa Basa make the most lasting, artistically ambitious LP of their career.  is a thrilling, 38-minute mix of Afrobeat, experimental disco, traditional Ghanaian styles, and global pop. Its eight tracks are a mix of instrumentals, English-language dance-floor numbers, and more traditional-leaning numbers sung in a variety of regional dialects like Ewe, Ga, and Hausa. The opening six-minute title track and “African Soul Power,” both driven by a mix of Afrobeat percussion and shockingly modern-sounding synth riffs, serve as centerpieces: both songs walk the line between the Fela Kuti protegee’s traditionalist past and the band’s forward-thinking, diasporic present circa 1978. Translated into English, Basa Basa means  , but the band’s music, honed during their years serving as the house band in Ghana’s legendary Napoleon Club, is often times anything but.

Victor Assis Brasil, a Brazilian saxophone prodigy who studied at Berklee College of Music, was clearly soaking up a ton of American and international music when he recorded   with a slate of gifted Brazilian players in 1970, a week before his 25th birthday. From the opening cymbal crash of Jimmy Heath’s “Gingerbread Boy,” the album’s sole cover, it’s clear we’re in for a wild ride. This is blistering, inventive jazz that feels more influenced by Coltrane’s pioneering work a decade earlier—and perhaps by 1960s psychedelic rock—than it does by Jobim’s uber-cool and mellow CTI output of the same era. There’s a dose of rock-ish fury on “Quarenta Graus A Sombra,” where Brasil’s runs take on a chaotic edge, a la Eric Dolphy (who, like Brasil, died unexpectedly in his mid-30s). But it’s not just Brasil and company’s calculated abandon that impresses on  ; three of the LP’s five tracks find him in a mellow mood. And, of course Brasil   influenced by Jobim; he recorded a four-track tribute to the great in the same session, reissued last year by Far Out Recordings, the same label responsible for this release. But even the slower songs feel unique. “Ao Amigo Quartin,” written for Brasil’s label head and friend Roberto Quartin, contains the lovely and intricate acoustic guitar flourishes (courtesy of Hélio Delmiro) that one might expect from a South American jazz ballad, but Brasil’s mournful caterwauls on the track call to mind gospel- and blues-entrenched solos of North American players like John Handy and Booker Ervin.

Two months after that album’s release, Washington—a Lamar collaborator—dropped his own ambitious project, a triple LP called  , on which the saxophonist explored gospel, soul, and funk in a whopping 173 minutes. It was an immediate hit, and in the years since its release, Washington has become the world’s foremost purveyor of big band, spiritual jazz. Yet 10 years ago, he and Porter were simply trying to make it, and the music collected for Porter’s new album— —represents that moment in time.  is Porter’s sophomore LP and a quick follow-up to 2017’s  , where the trombonist turned well-known children’s songs like “Itsy Bitsy Spider,” “Rain Rain Go Away” and “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” into grand orchestral suites.

The band had to keep all the windows closed, which caused unbearable heat, exacerbated by the Shack’s cramped conditions (the space comfortably holds four people; during the   sessions, eight people squeezed in). “After it was all said and done, The Shack smelled like tube socks and backpack straps,” Porter recalls in the album notes, “but the unity and love we have for each other was evident on every song.” To that end, there’s a strong communal essence to this record. These songs feel like extended jam sessions, and in certain spots—like on the 15-minute “Impressions” and the 17-minute closer “Chocolate Nuisance,” each band member is given ample room to flex their respective chops.   offers a glimpse into the past, well before these artists became synonymous with elite-level jazz.

But from his early choral pop adventures to his more recent journeys into Velvet Underground-esque walls of sound, Bigott has remained steadfast in crafting hook-packed songs that—through some magic combination of their author’s formidable pop savvy and the unexpected poetic benefits of writing in his second language—are equal parts funny, cinematic, and moving. Memorable lines abound in the Bigott discography (“Tropical mime / Dancing in the water / Beautiful Marvin Gaye” is one of my personal favorite opening salvos), and his numerous gems (like “The Reno Poem” from   and “Will Anything Happen” from  ) belong in the company of great tunes from more widely recognized outsider artists like Robyn Hitchcock to Bill Callahan.

Recorded over two weeks in Los Angeles, it’s a 20-minute jaunt through lo-fi punk and shimmering disco soundscapes with less emphasis on shoegaze-y walls-of-sound than Bigott’s last two offerings. “You can make it fun / You can make it dumb / You can break on through to the other side,” Bigott sings cheerily on the jangle-punk album opener, “Strangers By the Wall.” The loving but tongue-in-cheek nod to rock history is classic Bigott, and the message of unabashed pleasure-seeking is one the songwriter sustains throughout most of the album. The sonic aesthetic, though, takes a few U-turns—most notably on the disco-centric and lighthearted “Don’t Stop the Dance,” a honey-dripped dance track a la Spoon’s “I Turn My Camera On,” and the similarly sparkly “Moving On.” It’s not until   penultimate track that we’re reacquainted with some familiar Bigott sounds. But if the gentle, languishing “Walk In the Hood” is evocative of druggy ’60s Paisley pop, the molasses-slow, album-ending title track is the post-trip hangover. It’s a brutal, gorgeous, and drawn-out tease of a set-ender that only underscores the brevity of the album’s other nine tracks. But then, Bigott covers more ground in these twenty minutes than a lot of artists tackle in their entire careers. If this is your springboard into the visionary and strange world of Bigott, I’m jealous! There’s a ton more candy in store.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-bigott-candy-valley"}

His statement would have made a good subtitle for  , a new compilation of Irish rare groove, punk-funk, and electro put together by the collector and archivist John Byrne, and released by Dublin’s All City label. The comp captures a moment when bands with an interest in cutting rugs were boldly going it alone, juggling wide-ranging inspirations—silky New York disco, jarring No Wave skronk, dubbed-out drum-machine experiments—in relative isolation. “Quare” is an Irish variant of “queer,” or “odd,” though in Northern Ireland, it also has the additional meaning of “remarkable” or “excellent”; both definitions could easily apply here, in varying proportions. On the latter side, there are songs like the Pumphouse Gang’s “Welcome Back Into My Life,” a gorgeous slice of mid-tempo disco from 1979. The lone hit generated when half of the Scottish soul-funk group Cado Belle merged with Dublin’s Stagalee, it’s a slinky, starry-eyed love song that wouldn’t sound out of place being remixed by Masters at Work; there’s almost something uncanny about how American it sounds, in fact. Sunshine’s “Give It to Me” is a similarly faithful take on late-night disco. The Belfast group cut its teeth on the “showband” circuit, playing cover versions in community halls up and down the country, but its devotion to Chic yielded this airy original that effortlessly holds its own. Also falling squarely in the “excellent” column is Natural Wild’s own “Hot & Sexable (Mega Mix),” a jangly funk number in the vein of Shriekback, marked by slap bass, talking drums, and a chilly, dubbed-out ‘80s feel. The real heart of the comp, though, lies in its outliers. Those Nervous Animals’ “Hyperspace!,” from 1985, is a shuddering new wave jam with an intriguing mix of spiky rhythms, shouted vocals, and sophistipop breakdowns. Some of its sparkling high fidelity is the result of the Fairlight CMI sampling synthesizer, at the time still a rare—and staggeringly expensive—instrument. Stano’s “White Fields (In Isis),” a slow-motion electronic brooder, is another technological pioneer: It’s deemed the first Irish recording to make an extensive use of Roland’s TR-808 drum machine—an extension of Stano’s interest in using the studio as his instrument, an idea almost unheard of at the time. Barry Warner’s 1985 single “Losing Control,” meanwhile, is considered Ireland’s first-ever electro track. Repurposing a cassette-only song he had recorded as Ultimate Treason, Warner dropped the vocals and synth melodies, then added delay effects and vinyl scratching. A shuddering mix of 808 beats and cut-up synths, it’s obviously influenced by the era’s breakdancing sounds, but what makes it so exciting is that Warner is so clearly way out in left field, following his own quare muse.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-quare-groove-vol-1-review"}

From the operatic séance overtones of “Sulfur” to the dagger-drawing one-two punch of “Dreamours” and “Mind Environment”—ballads with blood on their lips—Moore and O’Sullivan are essentially writing anthems for the End Days.

Where their debut LP,  , contained some extremely solid songs but struggled for cohesion,   feels like a proper album. Halved not just by physical format but by two crystalline synth baubles (“Pool Cleaner” and “Pool Cleaner II”), this is a beast of an album that was built carefully and intentionally. A long shadow lies across the band’s sound here, as if it was drafted with charcoal; there’s always been the slightest chilly goth touch to HEBV’s songs, and on  it’s just slightly exaggerated—though not so far as to lose the group’s essence. The riffs on “Jaws” and “The Wizz” gleam with the same chrome as mid-’80s Killing Joke, but even those poppiest of tracks are still folded under distorted haze. The magnificent “Scum Rat” has enough scrambled solos and woozy discordancy to make its eventual fall off a precipice (the whole last minute of the song is deeply damaged dark psychedelic noise) feel like its logical conclusion, and the 12-minute “Onieut,” which closes out  , vamps on the odd beauty at the heart of that sort of wildness.

Though he’d been making music for years,   was his first album for visionary London label Ninja Tune, and was also the first one to feature collaborations with other artists. (Prurient’s Dominick Fernow supplies distorted vocals to the abrasive track “Degreelessness,” and Braids’ Raphaelle Standell-Preston sings on “RVK.”) It was also his first release after five years of relative silence, a period that, according to  , was marked by a constant touring to mask Fake’s dissatisfaction with the work he was creating at the time. That sense of frustration was all over   a year later, it stands as Fake’s and most uneasy and abrasive record, an album that moved him away from bucolic, pastoral techno and into decidedly grayer territory.  a new five-song EP that arrives around 11 months after  , combines Fake’s penchant for cinematic vistas and lush melodies with the urgency and punch of  ; its first three tracks skew dark: “Arcaibh” has a kind of inherent roughness, every kick drum, snare, and handclap working parallel to one another but never quite melting together. At several points, the percussion is overpowered by a beautifully melancholic synth line, but this too fades away. The song eventually dissolves into a finale full of sharp clicks and tape fuzz, all sound eventually drowning in a sea of echo. For  , Fake abandoned his previous production methods, which were purely computer-based, opting here to employ old Marantz tape decks, a Roland Jupiter-6 vintage synth, and a broken Akai drum machine, giving the songs an aged, slightly rickety feel. But if the EP opens in darkness, it ends on an emotional high. “Cloudswept” has a driving dance beat and a dense, twisty, high-end synth line; it sounds destined for afterparty sets, with rippling, joyous notes bound to hit all the brain’s pleasure centers. “Lea” ends the EP with a journey into sci-fi minimalism, bubbling major-key monosynth lines floating up like the oil in a lava lamp. And while there are moments on  that feel like a radical departure from Fake’s previous work, it also signals a deeper understanding of the ways to convey complex feeling into instrumental music.   is an album of controlled chaos; perfectly disjointed, raw songs that demonstrate Fake’s growth and newfound confidence.   is Fake in fearless mode, with minimal post-production and a youthful energy few of his contemporaries can match.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/nathan-fake-sunder-review"}

The Tuareg people are nomads who live throughout the Sahara; musically, they are known for their rural folk guitar as well as tende, a style of communal music that is also the name of the goatskin-covered drum used to create it. Tende is traditionally performed by young women, while the region’s guitar music is the bastion of men. Guitar, however, is a comparatively new addition, having entered Tuareg tradition in the ‘70s when young men living in exile in Libya and Algeria discovered the instrument and eventually brought it back to the villages with them. Les Filles de Illighadad is an all-female Tuareg group and   is this particular configuration’s first album; Ghali herself is one of only two female guitarists in Niger. On the album’s opener and title track “Eghass Malan,” the intermingling voices (which at times incorporate yodeling) summon the vibrant, celebratory spirit of a live tende performance. Handclaps, also crucial to tende, are prominent throughout the album, an additional form of percussion that complements the swells of desert guitar. By merging the timeless tradition of tende with the sonic possibilities of guitar, the music of Les Filles de Illighadad make a striking generational leap from the ancestral sounds of their rural community. Riding on waves of meditative riffs and the percussive power of the tende and calabash, the resonant voices on this album are echoes of pre-modern life, reverberating into the 21st century.", "genre": ["World", "African"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/les-filles-de-illighadad-eghass-malan-review"}

Since his 2014 breakthrough,  , the music James Whipple makes as M.E.S.H. has explored both the functional needs of the club and the expressive power of abstraction, challenging assumptions about dual premises that are often viewed as an either-or proposition. On  , he proves how limiting those premises are. On 2015’s  , M.E.S.H. applied the techniques of   to sonic world building, contemplating information overload with an arsenal of broken drums and pneumatic instrumentation. 2016’s   EP followed Newton’s third law, reacting to those paranoid soundscapes with a handful of club-ready reconstructions that overwhelmed the senses.  is the culmination and evolution of those works, building an abstract, techno-organic world but from within the club. That’s apparent from the first track, “Nemorum Incola,” which lives up to its title (Latin for “the inhabitants of forests”), mixing bird calls and machine hum as if a mecha is exploring the jungle in three dimensions. The mecha cuts back the brush to reveal “Mimic,” a layered composition that sees a three-note melody mutate to rhythm of organic hand drums and a fractured two-step shuffle before everything falls apart. That creation and destruction is apparent throughout the album, as individual tracks serve as self-contained experiments in juxtaposition, whether it’s the polyrhythmic battle of “2 Loop Trip” or the chainsaw synths and robotic call and response of “Search. Reveal.” Yet the experimental flourishes do not undermine the propulsive drive of the album: “Coercer” is noisy techno hypnosis, “Diana Triplex” is seductive with something lurking beneath the groove, and “Signal Ride Drum” moves through space like a rollercoaster inside a drum machine. The ride eventually ends, with the gorgeous, Baroque chords of “Ihnaemiauimx.” Not only does it call back  ’s beatless “Jester’s Visage,” but it closes the album on a somber, meditative note as we leave this lush—and fully constructed—world M.E.S.H. has created.", "genre": ["Electronic", "soundscapes"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/m-e-s-h-hesaitix-album-review"}

Like the rest of the album, the song’s riffs borrow as much from Motörhead as they do from Mayhem, all while managing to conjure the cobwebbed atmosphere of black metal’s Norwegian Second Wave.

Themes of heartbreak, addiction, loneliness, abuse, and the inevitability of death have comprised the bulk of the group’s subject matter and, on what songwriter Mathew Lee Cothran is calling the fifth and final album under this moniker, he approaches these topics with a newfound clarity. The reclusive North Carolinian, who’s most commonly recognized as one-half of the group Elvis Depressedly, rarely does interviews, but he frequently offers intimate personal details to anonymous fans on the Q&A website  . According to a number of his responses, he’s been sober for the last year or so, and  is a document of him reconciling with his troubled history. Although Cothran’s previous records—namely his 2011 breakthrough  and 2013’s  —were exceptionally grim, his narratives were shrouded in what sometimes felt like self-defensive allegory, as if poetic language was something he used to protect himself from his darkest thoughts. He drops much of that approach on  , offering his most direct lyrics to date. “Tether” outlines in sparse language the agonizing details of the trauma he endured as the child of violent addicts—and the rejection that enabled his own addictions. “Burden” uses the oddly pretty form of a folk rock song to explore the cyclical nature of destruction, featuring the hook, “My mom had a fucked up childhood / That’s the burden that we both bear.” “Window” is a painful look back at Cothran’s recent past, as he recalls the darkest periods of his alcoholism, living in squalor, and the room he used to fearfully hide in as a child with his mother. Songs like these feel, as the title implies, like Cothran is finally confronting memories he spent suppressing. The record doesn’t come anywhere near a conclusion or an understanding, but there are glimmers of hope that Cothran is at least coming close to forgiving himself (“Thunder”) and accepting that his life has value (“Running Wide Open”). Ultimately, though,  is about isolation: the isolation of addiction, the isolation of regret, the isolation of sobriety, and the isolation of memory. This is the first time in the project’s near decade-long career that Cothran’s been able to recognize the places those different forms of isolation intersect, and finally arriving at the notion that healing is possible.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/coma-cinema-loss-memory-review"}

That imprint was also home to probably the most rare song on this set, Belbao’s killer version of “Harlem Shuffle,” taken from a test pressing. Back in the ‘60s, Moroccan youth grooved to a different beat, as groups like Les Golden Hands created music akin to English bands like The Shadows and The Beatles. On this compilation, on a song called “Mirza,” the band recreates Nino Ferrer’s classic mod track, giving it a raw, garage-funk aesthetic. Elsewhere on  , singer Kamal Keila uses “Al Asafir” to showcase his voice—a rich, mesmerizing instrument that wafts gently through the melody. Through Habibi Funk’s releases, Stürtz and Kraus are hoping to connect young people across the Arab world with the music of their parents’ generations, like Samir & Abboud’s “Games,” an original mix of yacht rock and disco pop from Lebanon. An equally eye-opening track is Dalton’s “Soul Brother,” a sought-after slice of sunset soul from Tunisia that also appears on a Heavenly Sweetness/Pura Vida compilation called  .

Less than two years later, the 26-year-old musician is back with  , an ever-so-slightly more polished record that further refines Freeman’s balancing act between strict traditionalism and modern country-folk. Whereas   strove to merge the traditional and the modern into a seamless whole, Freeman’s second album, produced once again by Teddy Thompson, tends to make its sonic distinctions clearer. On one hand, yearning mid-tempo country weepers like “If I Could Make You My Own” and “Lovers on the Run” display Freeman’s natural knack for pop melodicism, while songs like “Over There and “Ern and Zorry’s Sneakin’ Bitin’ Dog,” the latter of which was written by her grandfather, display how deeply rooted Freeman’s music is to her hometown of Galax, Virginia, a longtime hotbed of traditional music. But Freeman never seems constrained by her country roots. Jazz-inflected pop crooning and ’60s R&B all play a part in shaping Freeman’s aching blend of roots and folk.   marks a progression in songwriting for Freeman, who’s become precise in her phrasing and increasingly attuned to the narrative power of a simple piece of imagery. “All the cans, and the bottles too,” she sings on the haunting “That’s All Right,” “they’re piling up, you’re passing out, and I’m turning blue.” On her second album, Freeman updates her influences while fine-tuning her songwriting, and the result is one of the most self-assured singer-songwriter records of the year. —", "genre": ["Country", "singer-songwriter"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/dori-freeman-letters-never-read-review"}

Jackie Shane is such a find. Born and now living in Nashville, but a bona fide star in 1960s Toronto, Shane sang soul as if her life depended on it—because  . Not only is she an African-American who barely escaped the Jim Crow South, Shane also pioneered a transgender identity when few civilized words existed for a woman like her. More than 50 years after her heyday, it still takes major chops and charisma to overcome racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia, so you can imagine what it took for Shane to pack Toronto clubs week after week and land a major, long-lasting regional R&B hit on Top 40 radio—particularly when the population was almost all white. That transcendent force is all over her first comprehensive retrospective. Featuring every one of her collectable single sides from the ‘60s and the entirety of her rare 1967 live album plus bonus outtakes,   is a remarkable document from a sociological perspective, but just as impressive from a musical one. Clearly schooled in gospel, as well as her era’s southern soul icons, Shane sings with a rasp that’s akin to Sam Cooke or James Brown. Yet her equally exceptional stage patter is a one-of-a-kind cross of Baptist preacher and LGBTQ pathfinder—sassy, a tad mischievous, but also self-possessed. The fact that she served up both in stunning silk suits with bouffant hair and fully feminine makeup throughout the ‘60s when a transwoman like her could get arrested for merely walking down the street is mind-blowing. Her confidence is as staggering as her ability. Both land bracingly hard on the introductory cut, “Sticks and Stones,” the B-side to her late 1962 debut single. “I’ve been abused / Deep down in my  ,” she belts in this breakneck rendition of the soul standard, then recently popularized by Ray Charles. It’s one of several tracks that testify to the LGBTQ experience through borrowed material, and the way Shane sings it leaves no doubt she’s suffered profoundly. Yet she also radiates a toughness that suggests Shane’s not to be troubled by any trifling words that might come her way. And the rest of the arrangement similarly exudes defiance—check that positively giddy piano break: If it were any faster, those speedy notes would blur into chords. “Tell her that I’m happy, tell her that I’m gay / Tell her I wouldn’t have it any other way,” she croons in her definitive interpretation of William Bell’s “Any Other Way.” This was her Toronto smash, a number-two sensation on CHUM, the city’s reigning pop station; a breakout hit in several U.S. cities, and an enduring cult favorite across Canada that prompted a 1967 re-release. Even then, the present-day understanding of “gay” was employed almost exclusively by homosexuals—it was inside code, not common vernacular. As smooth here as she’s sharp elsewhere, Shane delivers her declaration with an easy assurance that crosses every kind of cultural divide. Her worldly monologues documented on the “live” section of the album are even more daring for the repeated use of the word “chicken,” which is gay slang for young men. She talks about “my woman” to satisfy the straight crowd who likely saw her as a man in makeup, but also speaks freely of her fondness for “chicken” so that her own people knew exactly what’s up. Shane was the featured attraction in Frank Motley and the Hitchhikers, a Toronto-based live band led by a trumpeter who played two horns simultaneously. Like some of her singles, they’re coarser than she is, but their roughness only highlights her magnetism. Sighing sweetly one moment, screaming righteously the next, Shane gives herself gospel-style—completely—in every song as if willing herself to a Promised Land right here on Earth. “I’m not gonna let you get me down ‘cause I got too much on the ball,” she announces on “Stand Up Straight and Tall.” Only the foolhardy would try. —", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/jackie-shane-any-other-way-review"}

Maybe that’s because Alicia Bognanno screams with the pent-up fury of a million women. Or because there’s an air of anxiety running throughout all 12 of the album’s songs. Or maybe it’s just the title, which seems to cut right to the core of all the anger, sadness, and despair many of us are feeling about our current socio-political state. “When I’m around you / I try to keep my distance / I try to be respectful / It kills to be resistant,” Bognanno sings on “Kills to Be Resistant,” a song that somehow manages channel Dinosaur Jr. and distill the entire women’s movement into one lousy breakup. In reality, Bognanno says that  was written about the emotional fallout following Bully’s 2015 debut,  . “After being on the road so long and coming back to Nashville, we all had a lot of changes going on in our personal lives that we were trying to deal with and adjust to,” she explained, “and that was really the motivation for this one.” But with that groundwork in place, Bully has also created some of the most relatable anthems of their career. Like “Seeing It,” a woozy, guitar-heavy jam about the blurring experience of being “stuck in your own body.” Or “Blame,” which pairs sticky drums and soaring guitar hooks with lines like, “I wonder if sometimes you think / That you’ve created a monster / A bitch you can’t even blame / I swear to god I feel like her.” On “Either Way,” guitarist Clayton Parker summons the ‘90s pop-punk greats, while Bognanno rips through lines about love, lust, and greed with a heady mix of confidence and abandon. Taken all together,   becomes a soundtrack not for feeling down, but for pulling yourself up off the floor, confronting your sadness, and turning it into something constructive and healing.

After the opaque nocturnal allure of their earlier recordings, the New York City-based duo of Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion have come out of the dark, drenching their sharp pop songs in a warm, sumptuous glow that makes them more approachable and welcoming. While  draws on many of the same influences as its predecessors—namely, girl groups of the 1960s, like the Shangri-Las and the Ronettes, as well as chillwave artists like Toro y Moi and occasionally, the airy minimalism of the xx—here, they feel more lived-in. “I Took Your Picture,” for instance, contains echoes of Tame Impala’s kaleidoscopic psych rock, but delivers a human warmth and directness that the former lacks. Later, the thudding piano figures in “Recovery” blur the line between acoustic and electronic instrumentation to captivating effect. While the song’s narratives aren’t necessarily overflowing with giddiness or optimism, there is a newfound confidence and self-awareness in Follin’s lyrics that melds seamlessly with the songs’ colorful arrangements. The album begins with an intention to live in the present moment—“Know I can’t see it all yet / But it’s so real to me”—and then echoes that sentiment throughout; “Our time is nothing now / It slips through our fingers,” Follin sings later on “I Took Your Picture.” Keeping the forces of time and doubt at bay is never an easy task, she seems to be saying, but it’s worth the battle.

Originally released in 1983, the album is a collaboration between cult French composer and record producer Hector Zazou, Congolese singer Bony Bikaye, and electronic composing duo CY1. Vincent Kenis, who would later helm the Crammed Discs   series is also on board. The result is an album of glorious Afrofuturist electronic bleep and bump which sounds like it was transmitted from an alternate universe by funky retro-mainframes. Sometimes, collaborative world music albums discover one new vibe and stick with it from beginning to end. By contrast,   keeps spinning endless new variations on African boogie. “Dju Ya Feza” is a new wave rave-up reminiscent of a more metal-tinged, sweaty Talking Heads, with Bikaye growling and ominously declaiming the lyrics like a cross between Dracula and Cookie Monster. “Munipe Wa Kati” couldn’t be more different—a gentle lyrical tune with bird whistles set against electronic bloops and what sounds like a sawed violin. “Lamuka” is built on a foundation of repetitive, stiff keyboards, but adds in languid Afrobeat horns and Bikaye’s easy vocals; it’s “We Are the Robots” if the robots in question were AI implanted in flesh. The final track, “Woa,” is a joyful celebration of cross-cultural compatibility; the melody sounds a bit like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, but the echoey percussion of this collaboration avoids   terminal preciousness. The real revelation of the album, perhaps, is the balance it strikes between natural and artificial. Kraftwerk is often seen as a definitively European band, despite its huge influence on hip-hop and funk. But the ease with which Congolese rhythms fuse with echoes of “Trans-Europe Express” suggest that maybe the Germans had a computer-enhanced ear turned to another continent.

From that minimal instrumentation come meditations on melancholy, melodies that fold in on themselves, with Colleen weaving sounds together to create a choir of intricate chirps. On “Separating,” she whispers her lyrics with deliberateness. Her synth plays out like violin notes, and as the space grows, so does the rhythm. “Another world” circles on its own dizzying momentum. “Winter dawn” is among  ’s most striking moments, a song that pits beauty against tragedy, a slow-building synth sprawling out beneath her words. “The world had nearly ended yet the sky was blue,” she sings, “and I came home with a fistful of fear.” About four minutes in, as the electronics swell around her, she locates a moment of calm. None of this is accidental: Colleen   that this album was “composed over the course of a year marked by the constant presence of death.” She was in Paris on the night of the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, and wrote many of the songs after a close family member had fallen ill.

A prime example is the first album from the mysterious San Francisco composer Pauline Anna Strom. It features a rainbow-framed mandala with a blue sky, and in the center is a cracked egg with a Magritte-like eyeball staring back at you. It suggests a sound created far above Earth, surreal and heaven-bound. The uncanny synthesizer music contained within fully delivers on that promise. Released in an extremely limited edition back in 1982,   seemed to vanish immediately, fetching astronomical sums online. Six other LPs and cassettes followed throughout the decade in even smaller editions before Strom disappeared altogether. Outside of a few fervent fans—like MGMT and Legowelt—it seemed like her music was going to be lost to time. Now, the RVNG label presents an exquisite portrait of the enigmatic composer. This compilation contains four compositions from that album, as well as an array of tracks from her other albums. It’s an 80-minute collection that spans her work from 1982 to 1988, and it’s a psychedelic trip that elegantly dances between light and dark, ancient and futuristic. Most importantly, it casts much-needed light on the nearly forgotten composer. Born premature in Louisiana, an excess of oxygen caused complete optic nerve damage to the infant Strom, resulting in permanent blindness. As a child, she was drawn both to classical music as well as tales of ancient Egypt. She got caught up in the flower power of the ’60s and relocated to San Francisco’s Tenderloin District, where she’s lived since 1968. In the early ‘70s, she was taken in by the synthesized soundscapes broadcast by the Hearts of Space radio show in Berkeley, which introduced her to the likes of Tangerine Dream, Kitarō, Brian Eno, and Strom’s favorite, Klaus Schulze. Inspired, she began to explore music on her own in the wee hours of the night. The spirit of Schulze moves through her own music but, as   proves, Strom was a visionary in her own right. She may have been making synthesizer music in San Fran during the rise of New Age music in the early ‘80s, but her art slips outside of such easy categorization. It can feel relaxing and anxious at once. “In Flight Suspension” is as weightless as its title suggests, with quivering tones swooping down from across the stereo field, high frequencies sparkling at the edges. “Spatial Spectre” is a precursor to dark ambient, full of foreboding and tones liable to prickle your skin. Inversely, the giddy arpeggios of “Morning Splendor” are as magical and hushed as watching the first rays of a new day beaming over the horizon. It’s a perfect example of how Strom’s evocative touch on electronic keys conjures something warm and pastoral. —", "genre": ["Ambient", "Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-pauline-anna-strom-trans-millenia-consort"}

While   plays as a breakup record of sorts, it takes a different approach than the traditional externalization of grief and regret. Instead, Rankin seems determined to keep her focus turned inward, poking and prodding at her own experiences. The result is a record of abstracted fragments from a state of isolation, shaded by sporadic interactions, fleeting friendships, and gorgeous, gauzy guitar tones. “Your Type” details an inebriated romp through Paris, while “Lollipop (Ode to Jim)” recalls an encounter with Jesus and Mary Chain’s Jim Reid, replete with LSD and a chorus hook that rivals the addictive simplicity of “Archie, Marry Me,” from the band’s self-titled debut.

Except for “Ka-Cho-Fu-Getsu,” a 10-minute composition written for an animated short feature, most of the 24 tracks are only one or two minutes long—more fragments than songs. The whole is a kind of flattened cross between Paul McCartney and Raymond Scott, a mildly stoned Bugs Bunny taking Sgt. Pepper’s hand to trip through smooth fruity blips and plangent melancholy. “Tachikawa,” the album opener is built around an “aah”-ing chorus punctuated by tinkling pianos and sudden unexpected laser blasts—it sounds like a spinning carousel of angels displayed for purchase while intermittently but tastefully exploding. On “Boutique Joy,” a single female voice sings slowly while the beat thumps and plods, occasionally stuttering like a dropped coin coming to rest; it’s some sort of unholy fusion between doom metal and elevator music. “Seiko 4” speeds things up again, with repetitive tinkling slowly overwhelmed by horn-like lyricism. “Bridgestone 5” is a distorted, painful waltz.   treats the crass, bland soullessness of capitalism with such invention that you can’t help but be seduced into raptures, giggles, or both.", "genre": ["Soundtrack"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/yasuaki-shimizu-music-for-commercials-review"}

The four ambient electro-pop songs that comprised  were soft and introspective—gathering strength through quiet moments rather than stacking beats so high they might topple over. Piano led the charge, framing the London native’s rich, captivating vocals. The songs were mesmerizing, painting pictures through sounds. In 2016, she followed up with the EP  , on which she ornamented her songs with guitar accents and grounded them in the percussive rumbling of live drums. Tusks’s debut full-length,  , begins where  left off, with Underhill exploring the psychic ache of love and loss, and continuing to portray the visual through the aural. The album opens with “For You,” a chant-based piano ballad that quickly transitions from melancholy into urgency. The second track, “False,” is anchored by a pounding piano line, soft drums, and a sporadic, anxious guitar riff as Underhill whispers “I still believe, I still believe in you.” As the record continues, the songs build and swell and break back down again, Underhill’s steady vocals as the only constant as the album pulls deep focus on the intricacies of an unhealthy relationship. “Drench in recklessness / Disguise your selfish mess,” she sings at the beginning of “My Love” before finally succumbing to her toxic partner. “Oh my love, how you pull me back / I was lost, I didn’t see outside my head,” she confesses, amidst soft, disorienting beats. The subject matter is deeply personal yet comfortingly universal; given the body of work Underhill has amassed until now, this seems entirely intentional. Cinematic, emotive, and thoughtful,   encapsulates everything Tusks has been building to over the last three and a half years.

From the hair-raising howl that kicks off “Sail On!” to the smooth vocal runs on “Pass Me By,” Jones sings her heart out with the same commanding power that has defined her career; you’d be forgiven for thinking this was her first album, not her last. Unlike recent final albums from David Bowie and Leonard Cohen, both of which confronted death directly, the songs on   celebrate , both its highs and its lows; at times Jones is burning brightly in the throes of love, and in other moments, she’s stewing in the pits of heartbreak. As always, her long-time backing band the Dap-Kings deliver exuberant, stately horns and taut bass lines to launch her forward. “Rumors,” for instance, may be about an unfaithful man, but its lyrics are delivered with such coyness that it ends up feeling more playful than bitter. Later, in the slinky “Searching for a New Day,” Jones yearns for a fresh start; and the stately “These Tears (No Longer for You)” could easily be read as a kiss-off to a partner who doesn’t deserve her attention. In the end, there is no defeat to be found on Jones’s final recording. Instead, it is a testament to her faith in music and in the power of love.

Lee, who plays all the instruments, creates grinding death metal grooves that keep slowing down to a doom-paced trudge, not unlike Japanese semi-legends  . The album opener “Guillotine” starts with classical Chinese flourishes, cut off by a baby’s cry and a fat, trundling metal riff. That sound is consistent throughout; whether you’re listening to “Prolapsing Malevolence,” “Repugnant Cultivation,” or “Caustic Anatomized Stench,” your head bangs to the same heavy-heeled march. The music is satisfying in its unabashed filth; the vocals, by Wang, though, are almost miraculous, bubbling up from guttural depths plumbed by few since  ’s Antti Boman paved the way. Wang doesn’t so much sing as gurgle—a monstrous, burping gargle that suggests approaching sandworms experiencing intense intestinal upheaval. At points, like at the beginning of “Feeding the Disavowal,” he sounds like he may be forming words, but whether they’re in English or Mandarin or some language too hideous to be named—no one can possibly understand them well enough for him to incriminate himself.

Equal parts realism and romanticism,   guides the listener through the journey of life with a sense of poise and patience. While there is a destination in mind—a calm future, illustrated by a series of serene settings that crop up throughout the record—Nassau cherishes the voyage, and puts their faith in the natural goodness of the world.  opens at the pace of a new mountain stream—alive and steady, but tranquil. “We all get lost…but over time we turn around,” sings Wilcox on “Over Time,” showcasing his overt optimism and fondness for natural imagery. Those two threads run throughout the record; later, on songs like “Whatever Brings You Peace of Mind” and “Risin’ Sun,” the duo dabble in Appalachian folk, electric and acoustic guitars floating and swirling like fallen leaves in the breeze. On “Champagne” and “Long Arc,” two of the album’s more rollicking tracks, the quicker pace injects a welcome enthusiasm into the proceedings. Lyrically,   is fixated on transitions, natural and otherwise. There’s a palpable yearning—for resolution, or maybe simply order—throughout the record, but the songs never succumb to the anxiety of waiting. “Spring comes slowly don’t you know / Winter is over now you can go home,” Wilcox calmly sings on “Risin’ Sun.” The thaw comes again on the aptly-titled “Spring,” a song that starts with uncertainty (“Spring / I often wonder what you’ll bring”), ends with positivity and surrender (“Despite all my places to hide / You’ve always been kind”). At  ’s conclusion, the dreamy “Ain’t It Time,” we reach our destination, no longer looking forward, but embracing the power of the present. The chord change that arrives on the bridge captures the excitement of starting anew, but it’s immediately followed by a reversed guitar solo, suggesting that the past is never far. The song ends with the same warping guitars that open the album, completing the circle and starting the journey from the top. Ultimately,   is a song cycle in the truest sense, built on the understanding that life is on an unending loop of anticipation and resolve.

His particular style of hypnagogic pop owes as much to the hazy sketches of Knxwledge’s copious beat tapes as it does to the heirs of James Ferraro, and his sonic manipulations are far more than just savvy, detuned bits from turn-of-the-’90s songs.  is the proper showcase for an artist who treats samples less like loops and more like clay, reveling in sound that is moldable, squishable, and stretchable, to the point where groove is secondary to texture—and that texture is goopy enough for Nickelodeon to package and sell on the shelves next to Gak. Or at least it would be, if the music sounded sloppily whimsical instead of the wistful, frequently beautiful surroundings it presents. The end effect—all that wow and flutter, tempo distortion and off-centered tape reel wobble—invokes sounds not as just a blast from the past, but an  into the present, with all the wear and decay that the album suggests. It’s head nod soul for dead mall PAs, but the eclectic approach works, from the Quiet Storm voices turned into phantoms and specters to boogie synths rendered sticky, with melted plastic to digital reverb flickering like dying fluorescent lights. Tupac’s ghost rattles beneath the wallpaper on “inbloom;” a bossa-tinged Minnie Riperton loop is given lively caged-bird disorientation on “dayspass//time2think;” a drunken Teddy Ruxpin dreams of airships on his deathbed on “sleepyhead.” If there’s any nostalgia on  , it’s a curdled variety; sweep that away and you’re left with an album that thrives on the idea that ruins make for a good place to grow roots. —", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "vaporwave", "beat tape"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/elwd-all-good-things-reviews"}

The genre has long been defined by its extended passages of droning guitars, its anguished vocal roars, moments of melancholic ambience, and a commitment to experimentation and avant-garde practices over rival metal subgenres’ dalliances with “fun” (ie spandex, solos, and carefree headbanging). From Isis’   to Aidan Baker’s  , post-metal also has an eerie obsession with succumbing to the deadly lure of the sea. In certain ways, Philadelphia’s   plough a similar furrow. Their sixth album boasts funereal tempos and sombre soundscapes galore. Pain and frustration is vented through guttural growling paired with riffs the size of Mount Etna. Obligatory lyrical references to being cast adrift and sinking downwards are present and correct. Yet there is something weirdly life-affirming about this quintet’s sound that separates them from the majority of their post-metal brethren, and with each subsequent Rosetta release this vague sense of defiant optimism has floated closer to the dark surface. It can be detected in the melodic nature of this record’s softer vocal parts as well as in the often shimmering, twinkling nature of Rosetta’s lead guitar patterns which are, dare we say it, almost U2-ish in their ability to raise one’s spirits. It’s present too in Rosetta’s deployment of the kind of rapturous instrumental crescendos that will compel fans of Godspeed You! Black Emperor or Explosions In The Sky to start speaking in tongues. Elsewhere,   draws on the inherent playfulness of prog rock and, as you’d expect from a group who’ve labelled their style as “metal for astronauts,” the record boasts plenty of cosmic textures. Apparently when somebody is close to death by asphyxiation, they will experience a euphoric high as they begin to lose consciousness. A similar sensation may be felt by listening to  , a soundtrack for floating in the cosmos, without the risk of actually having to suffocate oneself—or, for those who happen to be an astronaut, without having to remove one’s helmet in the middle of deep space.", "genre": ["Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/rosetta-utopioid-review"}

Like Kuti and his landmark anti-military statement “Zombie” (copies of which were burned en masse by the Nigerian government), Antibalas, whose name translates to “without bullets” or “bulletproof,” regularly incorporate visceral political commentary into their music. Their new album,  —their first in five years—is no exception, but it offers an added twist to the equation: an idyllic alternative to a world rife with sinister forces. The album begins with a look deep into the past. Opening track “Gold Rush” examines America’s history of exploitation with an unflinching gaze; at one point, over a mesmerizing tangle of horns and keys, lead singer Duke Amayo cries out the names of Native American tribes who have been torn apart, and often exterminated, by the forces of capitalism and human cruelty. “Hook & Crook” treads on similar themes, but also finds Amayo flying to the peak of Kilimanjaro “to gain an outer worldly perspective.” What does he find there? The need to “detach, detach.” It’s a pivotal moment that segues into the album’s three-part finale “Tombstown,” which depicts an island “rich of gold, lush with green” whose residents live in peace. Unfolding over a total of 15 minutes, the “Tombstwn” suite allows the entire 12-piece band ample time to flex their muscles as Amayo buries himself into a sumptuous (and imaginary) world.

A Windy City native, Eagle riffs on the pain of government-sanctioned trauma, resulting in his most heartfelt work to date. On  , Eagle talks about the plight of his hometown’s ghetto, while staying true to his core musical formula, where sharp punchlines meet thought-provoking introspection. “Legendary Iron Hood” is the theme for a young heroic, mystic figure determined to overcome the tragedies of poverty and neighboring gang activity. Here, Exile’s keys, a muffled drum, and electric guitar give the song a folkish backdrop, a contrast to the project’s hyperactive single—“Brick Body Complex”—where Eagle raps from the perspective of the final building to be torn down over rattling percussion. “95 Radios” is a soothing homage to golden age hip-hop airwaves that loosely ties into the album’s greater narrative, as Eagle and the song’s producer Has-Lo reflect on how their affinity for the likes of Q-Tip and De La Soul became a refuge from their harsh surroundings. On “Daydreaming In The Projects” Eagle extols the ability of youth to transcend its circumstances (over an arrangement that pays mild homage to video game composer Koji Kondo). A master of detailing the human condition, Eagle weaves satire with sadness on “No Selling (Uncle Butch Pretends It Don’t Hurt),” the tale of a character so accustomed to trauma that he’s become numb to emotion.   closes with the noisy, angsty “My Auntie’s Building.” Here, Eagle vents: “They say America fights fair, but they won’t demolish your timeshare.” The line feels especially sharp—a wry punchline that reveals a stinging truth. —", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "underground hip hop", "conscious hip hop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/open-mike-eagle-brick-body-kids-still-daydream-album-review"}

Singing in neutral, unaffected voices, vocalists Barnaby Weir and Daniel Weetman evoke a cautionary cool all the more frightening for its neutrality. When the title track arrives on wings of fathomless ragga bass midway through the album, it’s unclear if the titular fabric—of a love affair, society, whatever—is repairable or permanently frayed. Feelings of disquiet increase in the album’s home stretch, beginning with Noam Chomsky’s dire spoken intro to “Beleza”: “In the global scene we are racing towards a precipice which we are determined to fall over which will sharply reduce the prospects for decent survival.” To which Weir adds the existential double-whammy, “Time and money / All it brings you is trouble.” We’re soon in deep water indeed during the cemetery funk and spooky keyboard layers of “Lost in the Bush,” an echoing nightmare in which “the mothers pull the anchor in the cold dead of night.” No, all is not rainbows and good vibes in New Zealand, but the Black Seeds deliver enough buoyant reggae-funk to cut the dread. —", "genre": ["Reggae", "rocksteady", "funk rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-black-seeds-fabric-review"}

That’s certainly the case for Maalem Mahmoud Gania’s recent release,  , Gania’s final studio recording, issued posthumously following his death in 2015. Gania was a Moroccan performer of Gnawa, an Islamic religious tradition of music, dance, and ritual poetry. He played the guembri, a three-stringed bass lute.

The songs on the album all range from eight to 11 minutes in length, and they all blur into each other, a single, 70-minute long trance. The guembri sets up a supple, rhythmically intricate, shifting bassline and shaken percussion adds an itchy beat. Gania raises his voice in a wailing voice that’s half-sung, half-chanted, while background singers join in for a call and response.

Originally from Mississippi, May moved to L.A. a few years ago.   uses a rich sonic palette to explore the existential side of California glam: a collage of disco strings, crystalline guitars (with the occasional harmonized fuzz solo), and bright-eyed piano chording. Over the ‘80s pop thrum of “Picture On A Screen,” he ponders our affection for digitized incarnations of people we may never meet, while the echoey, barroom-piano shuffle of “90210” finds him adapting to his new West Coast home. “Face Down in the Gutter of Your Love” brings plucky funk riffing and a string-driven, stomp-and-clap boogie breakdown to the fore. May wants to engage earnestly with cotton-candy poptimism just as much as he wants to poke holes in those same enticing, falsified structures—and in doing so, he weaves a playful, warm soundscape over which to ponder our mortality and loneliness.

On  , Martin further showcases his creative growth while giving a platform to a small group of frequent collaborators he named The Pollyseeds. Martin’s varied sonic influences play a key role in this album’s diversity.  ’s lead single, “Intentions,” stacks G-funk synths over Prince’s renowned Linndrum, leading to a suitable backdrop for Chachi’s (Compton MC Problem’s alter ego) scenic club narrative. Capping things off with a nod to Debarge’s 1982 classic “I Like It,” the end result sounds like the natural evolution for a generation raised on Dr. Dre’s  . Elsewhere, with the help of friend and famed pianist Robert Glasper, Martin’s vocoder rendition of Janet Jackson deep cut “Funny How Time Flies” nods to the arrangements perfected by Herbie Hancock during his late ‘70s fusion period. “Mama D/Leimert Park” (named after a landmark for L.A.’s avant-garde jazz and hip-hop scenes) is steeped in traditionalism: a loop of the infamous “Impeach The President” drum break provides the necessary edge to keep the song’s breezy saxophone lines from tipping over into spineless cool jazz. Songs like “Feelings Of The World” tap into common daily struggles, as Chachi and vocalist Rose Gold sing the blues of coping with different crises—eviction and a relationship shattered by infidelity—while accompanied by a wailing electric guitar. With  , Martin executes each small step with precise vision, spreading messages of peace along the way. The album concludes with “Don’t Trip,” a riveting gospel-based composition on which singer Preston Harris plays the role of a choir soloist. In the background, Martin hums the soothing phrase “God will always love you forever” through his robotic talkbox. On an album full of sonic nuance, this is the final example of how the tools at his disposal can create uplifting moments. —", "genre": ["Experimental", "R&B", "G-Funk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-terrace-martin-presents-the-pollyseeds-sounds-of-crenshaw-vol-1"}

On their third album,  , they expanded their scope, trying to dig up the   of that violence in religion, philosophy, and biology. On  , their focus has become even more diffuse. Early in the haunting opener “A Private Understanding,” frontman and lyricist Joe Casey declares: “Not by my own hand / Automatic writing by phantom limb,” and much of   seems to follow that M.O. Gone are the “hawks ripping out liars’ eyes” and “dogs eating their young.” In its place is language that’s looser and even more stream-of-consciousness. The grinding “Here is the Thing” feels like a bleak MadLib of contemporary catastrophes, Casey itemizing, “New face loves surveillance, comic sans, parroting an ape” as the band kicks and grunts behind him. On the tumbling “The Chuckler” Casey balefully sings, “War and rumors of war / Clouds of poison in the sky and poison in the soil,” before delivering the kicker: “Lord, how I wish there was a better ending to this joke.” The pensive “Up the Tower” condenses the album’s entire thematic thrust into one microcosm: it begins with Casey sharing a cigarette with a man on a corner, but as the song goes on, the lens widens: Protesters burst through police blockades and storm a mansion until they reach “the golden door”—the entire song shifting from the personal to the political to, arguably, the theological in the space of 90 seconds. Throughout  , the band scales outward to match the lyrics’ wide grasp. On their first two albums, they felt feral and unglued, but on   they began softening the edges of their sound. They continue that expansion on   to spectacular effect. The opening of “My Children” is chilling in its spareness, just a few icicle-like guitars from Greg Ahee dripping slowly in the background as bassist Scott Davidson and drummer Alex Leonard stalk the song’s edges. Even when it gains speed, it still feels open and harrowing, Ahee preferring bent-wire post-punk leads over brick-like riffing. “Night-Blooming Cereus” is the closest thing to a ballad the band has written yet, floating along on an eerily-serene synth line, Ahee’s guitar appearing only in lightning-flashes. Casey has grown exponentially as a vocalist in the short five years since  ; for much of  he adopts a kind of weather-beaten croon, all the better to serve the band’s increasing fondness for empty spaces. If Protomartyr have a clear antecedent, it’s The Fall, another band who paired knotty guitar work with declamatory vocals and lyrics that are, by turn, cutting and obscure. But where The Fall seemed content to submerge themselves in the acid of cynicism, Protomartyr have always looked for opportunities to come up for air. At the end of “The Chuckler,” Casey seeks solace in a phone call with “A direct-marketer from Bangalore.” They talk about life and the weather and the fact that the person on the other end of the phone shares a name with a friend of Casey’s. It’s a small detail, but on an album preoccupied with global ruin, it also offers a few seconds of hope. Even now, in an age lit by burning cities, surviving on polluted water and expired food, human connection—even between a rock singer and a customer service representative—is still possible.

Within their verses, Fact and EP conjure up dingy, non sequitur vignettes, taking close-ups of demented deadbeats on benders, holed up in roach motels and decrepit nursing homes. The rappers wear black cloaks for no apparent reason, other than to conjure up a cultish flair. On  , their recently-released sixth full-length album (excluding a handful of instrumental LPs), Fact and EP have turned this bewildering barrage into a massive manifesto, but it’s also just another chapter in their long-running gag. That the Doppelgangaz don’t take themselves too seriously is obvious; that they never let up on their bit is the real accomplishment. Until recently, the Doppelgangaz pushed a smooth-around-the-edges style of boom-bap, using dusty beats as the backdrop for tortuous plots.   confirms a recent and still developing turn in which they lean nostalgically into smooth R&B and G-funk without sacrificing the shock value of their tongue-in-cheek horrorcore. “Strong Ankles,” with its pristine synths and bubbling bass, might be a sultry banger in another MC’s hands, and while Fact and EP turn it into a love song of sorts, their barometers for attraction are morsels of lovey-dovey repulsion. “Shorty sneeze guacamole and when she’s bleeding it’s ragu,” Fact quips at one point, never letting on that a joke has been told. “Rapamycin,” named for a non-recreational pharmaceutical you won’t hear anyone else in the rap game brag about, is a mission statement on debauchery and gourmet tastes alike. Then on “Roll Flee,” EP strings together enough exotic rarities to trigger a dozen new Google searches. That skin condition of his you can’t stop looking at? It’s not mites, it’s a form of herpes called zoster. His four-legged companion? A Madagascan mammal called a fossa. The dinner bill they’re dashing from? An extravagant sushi lineup from New York’s famous Masa. All this in a few grinning, spectacular bars. It sounds random because, well, it is, but the Doppelgangaz revel in this type of weirdo world-building. Baffling vocabulary and clever lyricism allow both rappers to say a lot with a little. Then again, even once you’ve sussed out a meaning, you might still wonder what the hell these guys are talking about. There’s no setup or post-joke wink in a Doppelgangaz verse. There’s no punchline at all.

The mysterious New Zealand electronic music act was part of a burgeoning ‘90s electronic scene in New Zealand after which he released two albums and was never heard from again. One of those albums,  was initially released in 1998 on New Zealand label Kog Transmissions, which began as a collective of New Zealander electronic musicians who lacked other outlets to share their music. The other album, released under his name Denver McCarthy, was devoted to the gurus of Hare Krishna and won the Best Independent Album Release award at the 2000 BNet New Zealand Music Awards. Micronism’s obscurity adds both weight and value to the reissue of  , which is available digitally and, for the first time, on vinyl through Loop Recordings Aot(ear)oa. Touches of acid, breakbeat, and glitchy ambient abound, but the album never sticks to any one clear genre. Instead, Micronism uses genres as a tool, employing elements from dub techno, acid, house, and ambient to form a sound built for both introspection and movement. Floating synths, contemplative chords, and soft glitches create space to reflect, while heavy kicks and pads rouse and revive. The track “First Reflections” falls into the latter category: the rhythm is steady and propulsive, and synths sparkle and flash like strobe lights in a dark room. “Restless Address” is moodier, drums reduced to a pinprick of sound, enveloped by mist-like electronics. The tracks are woven together, creating a single, seamless musical experience. Taken in full, Micronism has created a universe of energy and lightness—it’s an album just as effective in solo listening as it is on the dancefloor. —", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance", "techno"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/micronism-inside-a-quiet-mind-reissue-review"}

He can stretch a note, then round it off neat; he enunciates clearly and declaims with range; he is equal parts strength and  , and zero parts smarm. You imagine it comes as the result of great experience, which it does. He’s worked with late legendary bandleader Horace Tapscott and current tenor-sax torchbearer Kamasi Washington. He sings mantras with Pharoah Sanders, format-breaking compositions with Nicole Mitchell, and electronic cut-and-paste with Mark de Clive-Lowe and Carlos Niño. His new album was made in England with trumpeter and producer Matthew Halsall, far from the fertile musical groundswell of Los Angeles. But it does find him in the taproot of his jazz endeavors—it’s a straightforward, straight-ahead showcase for his earnest interpretations. It’s called  , which could well apply to his repertoire choices. Spiritual concerns are considered in “Heaven & Hell” by Dorothy Ashby and “Dear Lord” by Alice Coltrane. A single pedal point on “What The World Needs Now” and a wholly-committed essay on “Feeling Good” chug along at an even pace. The standard “I Love Paris” and Donny Hathaway’s commentary “Tryin’ Times” deliver equal intensity to different ends. Folk song “Black Is The Colour of My True Love’s Hair” and spiritual “Deep River” connect to longer histories. It’s all clearly executed with full-throated investment, which makes it easy to believe he’s inspired. The setting, however, is more a blowing session than a syncretic collaboration. The bulk of   takes place at relaxed or slower tempos. The rhythm section of Taz Modi (piano), Gavin Barras (bass), and Jon Scott (drums, chiefly) is tactful and propulsive as necessary, but generally unobtrusive. Similarly, Halsall solos with restraint and ample space—he certainly doesn’t upstage his guest. If you know what else the leading men are capable of, perhaps you’d be looking for a deeper synthesis of big ears.

Teen group  ’s debut   takes on that time-honored trope by reaching beyond its years, finding a convincing simplicity to its unified compositions. Vocalist Poppy Hankin has a light, disarming vocal approach; verses like, “I have waited quite some time / Stood my ground, and fuck you’re not obliged,” only feel more impactful. In this instance, her words feel weighty, emotionally honest and resilient. The North London outfit open up with spartan rhythms and playful jangling on “Just Like That,” which has a bit of a Velvet Underground feel. Gentle flourishes of keys, strings, and trumpet throughout the album add warmth and texture. On the album’s Carole King-esque power ballad single, “Stupid Things,” a piano takes over; there’s a truly classic Brill Building essence to what Girl Ray does, from irresistible pop hooks to heavy-hearted lyrics. What makes   an extra-compelling listen is Girl Ray’s commitment to studio exploration, choosing to experiment rather than cement one sound. They toy with tempo and tone on “A Few Months,” managing three distinct movements in four minutes. “Cutting Shapes” begins with a nodding chug of organ and percussion that splits at the seams for a nervy, clamorous finish. The most pronounced example of this is the 13-minute “Earl Grey (Stuck in A Groove),” an exercise in lo-fi moodiness that gradually unfurls into a meditative, proggy trance. Hankin gets lost in her thoughts here, musing freely as lovelorn teenagers do: “I’ve got a little bit of time to give / But I’ll cut it in half if you want more too.” What Girl Ray lack in experience is never an issue on  ; instead the trio exude youthful curiosity and abundant pop charm.", "genre": ["Pop", "indie pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/girl-ray-earl-grey-review"}

It’s an appropriate metaphor for Grim Streaker’s debut EP  : it’s grim at face value, but full of irreverent humor. The songs on the EP have the grind and rattle of early Joy Division, the buzz of Bikini Kill, and a healthy smear of the Cramps’ grime. Vocalist Amelia Bushell is raucous and commanding throughout, her laser-guided vocals giving the songs a threatening edge. Bushell’s confidence and range seem to develop throughout  ’s four tracks, bursting with manic energy by the time she arrives at the album-closing “Miami Girl.” In that song, she howls out accounts of the debauchery that she and guitarist Dan Peskin witnessed in the city that gives the song its title. “I got my face ripped, in Miami,” she howls, “I got my nose chopped off, in Miami.” As the song accelerates, she sarcastically repeats, “Come at me, bro!” before lunging into a bug-eyed shriek.

Lily West, Gussie Larkin, and Abe Hollingsworth, known collectively as the post-punk band Mermaidens, call Wellington home, too, and their determination, work ethic, and colorful vintage clothes have helped them to stand out amid the city’s vibrant culture. They owe a lot to the city and its greenery, which inspired their debut album  . On their new album,  , they turned their attention to the sun and how its warmth washes over one’s skin and creates positive energy. Larkin says while writing the album, she and West had been “thinking and talking about pleasure and pressure” and “the contrast of being in a blissful state, but with an underlying anxiety or uncertainty being present, too.” The album captures this duality on the title track, which opens with the line “Your perfect body won’t save you now,” and again on second track “Sunstone,” when they sing “Don’t let me overwhelm you.” The band declares an admiration for Sleater-Kinney and Warpaint, and that influence can be heard on “Mind Slow” and “Give It Up,” where the guitars have a more fluid pop-inflected flavor, and fold nicely around the vocals. “Sunstone” and “Satsuma” are both a little grittier, and are driven by pummeling bass rhythms that give the lyrics a more sinister quality. On “Satsuma” they sing, “You were sweet like satsuma, when I peeled you off and split you in two,” before repeating the line “Don’t live in bad dreams, think about the good things.” Both songs highlight the band’s willingness to bring depth and dissonance into their music.  is also a significant release for the iconic   label.

Much of the songs on   are experimental little sound bites, crackly recordings of Perrey demonstrating the Ondioline’s abilities. He runs through instruments sounds, mimicking a French horn, banjo, oboe, castanets, violin, mandolin, and even a cat’s meow; some, like the bongos and the cello, are more convincing approximations than others. The set also features a few more fully-formed numbers that occasionally find Perrey in collaboration with other artists. “L’âme des Poètes,” with Charles Trenet, is a beautiful, dreamy ballad that brings to mind a soft-focused midnight stroll through Paris in a romantic drama. By contrast, “Barnyard in Orbit” is truly goofy, parading synthetic animal sounds alongside samba-lite rhythms: you hear a duck’s quack, a pig’s snort, a cuckoo’s signature call.  is playful, steered by a sense of wonder and delight.

Creation Rebel came into being when Sherwood—a young studio hound and a face on London’s post-punk scene—was passed tapes of Jamaica’s The Arabs, who were then Prince Far-I’s backing band.

But leave it to idiosyncratic producer Maurice Fulton to dig deeper and go weirder. Fulton’s résumé spans genres, from adding keys to Crystal Waters’s mid ‘90s tracks to funking up the likes of !!!, Hot Chip and Róisín Murphy. Since 2010, he’s worked most often with the Zanzibar-born, Sheffield-based Swahili vocalist Mim Suleiman. While Fulton’s workload waxes and wanes, his work with Suleiman has been constant;   marks their fourth effort together. All the earmarks of a Fulton production are in full effect here: live drums tangle with both programmed beats and crackling Afro-Cuban percussion, electronics blip and gurgle like Pac-Man at the bottom of a swamp, keyboard bass lines rumble like Jabba the Hutt with gas, echo and delay fx are deployed at just the right moment to maximize the more psychedelic moments. Suleiman’s powerful pipes are the perfect match for every last trick in Fulton’s playbook. Timbales break out amid “Kwanini” and a church organ swoops in to accentuate Suleiman’s stacked vocals. A proper techno kick powers the club-burning “Mzinga,” but Mim holds her own against the rhythm. As all manner of digital hiccups dribble across the crisp live drums of “Maso Maso,” Mim’s brassy voice remains front and center; she remains the song’s focal point, even as everything else in the mix starts to get dubbed out and gaseous. Unless you have a full grasp of Swahili, the topics of Suleiman’s songs will elude your grasp. The album’s title translates as either “reason” or “tradition” (though it can also refer to the philosophy of nationalist, pan-Africanist, and socialist ideologies). Whatever it is that Suleiman is singing about, let’s at least hope her work with Fulton remains a recurring tradition. —", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mim-suleiman-kawaida-album-review"}

In the Detroit-based collective, anyone other than the human airhorn almost seems superfluous. Brown is the magnet, the charge, the force, and the fury. To draw attention away from a power like that requires both skill and outsized personality. ZelooperZ, one of Brown’s running mates in the Bruiser Brigade, also has a unique rapping cadence, and he let his eccentricities shine on his 2016 debut,  . But that record lacked the cohesiveness and aesthetic unity that’s made Brown one of the biggest rappers around. And so, much like how Brown teamed with producer   for the large bulk of  , ZelooperZ has paired up with Zach Saginaw (aka Shigeto), dubbing the resulting union ZGTO. Their debut,  , proves they’re perfectly suited to one another’s styles. Shigeto, born in Ann Arbor but now living in Detroit, has been a pioneer within Ghostly International’s electronic community for some time, blending aquatic synths to create house-leaning techno that bears traces of Detroit’s sonic influence without relying too heavily on it. On  , ZelooperZ (born Walter Williams) and Shigeto harness their strengths to maximal results, making songs that drown in layers of sludge, sport half-sung vocals, and trip along to off-kilter, untethered beats. Shigeto reins in ZelooperZ’s stream-of-consciousness tendencies by pairing his words with heavily emotive instrumentation. “I’mma live forever for my enemies,” ZelooperZ says on album opener “Drownin in the Paint.” The exact opposite of Waka Flocka’s similarly-named anthem, “Hard In Da Paint,” ZelooperZ’s voice is constantly slipping, dancing around the beat with the loose cadence of a man who seems like he can’t be bothered. He stays remarkably engaging in spite of his freewheeling approach: In his mind, he’s better at rapping than you are, and this album is an exercise in showing precisely how, and in what ways. With the help of Shigeto, Williams is able to situate his scattershot rap style within a distinct framework, and his work is better for it. While Shigeto isn’t necessarily treading unmarked terrain on  , he matches ZelooperZ’s distinctive quality song-for-song, narcotizing his frenetic style in favor of something more emotionally pummeling and dark. “Band Man” is a slow-motion anthem, while “Off Dat” gifts ZelooperZ’s haunted-house vocals an equally spooky meandering synth line. While ZelooperZ’s threatens to steal the show with his newfound consistency and vision, Shigeto is the stylist behind the show. Like all good collaborative projects,   succeeds because both artists are hellbent on bringing the best out of each other.

The Gothenburg group—whose members are still, mostly, teenagers—write songs that center around neuroses; sometimes, they’re romantic (“Frustrerad” peaks with Alatalo howling, “Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me…up”), but most of the time they’re panicked responses to everyday dilemmas. Album opener “Derogatory Embrace” rockets out of the gate with roundhouse drumming and a guitar line that sounds lifted from an early Cure demo, as Alatalo, with her deep-blue alto, bellows, “I’m stuck with feeling / Like I’ve met everyone worth meeting.” The rest of the record is just as tightly wound. The roaring “Strand” is an anthem caked in icicles, the dueling guitars of Felix Skörvald and Lucas Gustavsson jutting up the center, sharp and crystalline. Like much of   the action unfolds in jittery fast-forward: “Dizzy blurs left behind blonde highlights / Different kisses every night.” Skörvald, Gustavsson, and Alatalo used to play Joy Division covers together at local open mics, and  manages to capture all of that group’s darkness with none of the nihilism. “(Don’t) Talk to Strangers” subtly cops the spiraling guitar arpeggio of “Don’t Stop Believin’” for a song that’s just as anthemic in its own way, and is centered around advice from Alatalo that feels as if it was learned first-hand: “Don’t talk to strangers / You’ll fall in love with them.” “Red, White Rose” is a harrowing bit of divebombing goth-pop, Alatalo singing of cigarettes and lipstick stains while Skörvald and Gustavsson drape guitars like black lace around her. And while  may spasm with nervousness, there’s a sense of exultation, too. The sweaty recklessness of youth only comes around once; you may as well throw yourself into all of it. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "goth"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/agent-bla-debut-review"}

Drummers   and Dave Treut help heat things up; cellist Markia Hughes swoops in to cool things down. But Seabrook’s guitar leads are paramount here—darting, dizzying, dazzling, and trilling, forever daring the others to keep pace. “Clangorous Vistas” is a hailstorm of scraped riffs. “Abccessed Pettifogger” jerks from math rock to brush-strings to percussive sprints. On the all-to-brief “Litany of Turncoats,” all seven players stir up a furious, glorious din. Churning headrush “The Greatest Bile Pt. 1” wheels spastically between punk, metal, and psych, before yielding near its end for a Hughes solo. Comparatively contemplative for its first half, “The Greatest Bile Pt. 2” eventually succumbs to chaos. There is a capricious and exploratory quality to this music that’s reminiscent of Japan’s   and the oeuvre of John Zorn, who is among Seabrook’s many past collaborators. What sets  apart is that it’s permitted to catch its breath, to catapult into weirder directions; it’s not  full-bore all the time. “Quickstep Grotesquerie,” a bizarre sinkhole of effects and lysergic vocals, shines a spotlight on  ’s secret MVP: NYC-based noise artist Chuck Bettis, of  .

But as with many people who grow older, the four members of the group eventually moved out of town—in this case, up the Hudson River north of New York City. That happy accident of mutual proximity, and master drummer Jack DeJohnette’s 75th birthday, spurred this new project, which also features John Medeski (keyboard instruments), Larry Grenadier (bass) and John Scofield (guitar). They form a multi-generational crew of improvisers, particularly noted for working at the nexus of jazz, funk, and rock. (See: Medeski Martin and Wood, or Miles Davis c. 1969, or the bulk of Scofield’s discography.) Yet their first album isn’t an overt fusion of a style x + style y. Their mergers are more subtle, gestures from musicians who have lived through a lot, and who now freely supplement their common dialect at their own leisure and discretion. About half of   is original compositions, with the remainder written by folk and rock musicians connected to their home region: Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Jimi Hendrix, and Levon Helm of The Band. The latter portion is read with a deceptive cleanliness, with Scofield clearly stating melody lines; at times, Hudson comes close to being a rather overqualified instrumental cover band. Sensing as much, the quartet attempts to match its musical choices with the lyrics of the originals—see the messy apocalyptic breakdown on “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” or the unsettled wistfulness in “Woodstock.” DeJohnette takes the vocal mic on the New Orleans-inspired mixed-meter shuffle “Dirty Ground”; his “Song For World Forgiveness” transforms into a rock ballad. The band sounds more conventional on the hard-bop blues throwdown “Tony Then Jack,” or on the Spanish-tinged churn of “El Swing.” All this makes their opener a red herring, as the collective, groove-driven improvisation “Hudson” suggests this meeting of minds might be a loud, high-intensity jam band. But by their closer, “Great Spirit Peace Chant”—literally a group chant, inspired by the native inhabitants of the Hudson Valley—it’s the range of what they attempt which echoes loudest. —", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-jack-dejohnette-larry-grenadier-john-medeski-john-scofield-hudson"}

In 2015, former Kmart employee Mark Davis uploaded the 56 KMRT tapes he’d collected between 1989 and 1992 to  .

When the two players combine their talents, the results are an engrossing combination of centuries-old balladeering, pre-war music, and contemporary experimental sounds. True to old-time form, House and Land’s songs revel in spooky darkness, driven by ghostly, off-kilter notes that raise the hair on the back of your neck. Morgan’s fiddle creaks and moans, while Henson’s hyper-detailed guitar playing alternates among airy flits, glistening cascades, and blooming billows. Henson and Morgan trade off lead vocal duties, and they harmonize so closely at times, as on the unaccompanied “Johnny,” that their two voices almost sound like one. When Henson sings of the hour of death drawing near and laying garments down, “So time will soon disrobe us all / Of what we now possess,” she sounds as though she’s personally heralding the end of days; her high, fearless delivery makes you inclined to believe her. But the duo splits from tradition with its addition of shruti box drones, as well as with light touches of percussion from Asheville drummer Thom Nguyen. On “Feather Dove” and “The Day Is Past and Gone,” his soft rumblings and cymbal splashes recall a distant but fierce summer storm, while his clatters in the background of “Unquiet Grave” are a chilling, chaotic foil to the song’s pointed lyrics about pining for a dead lover.

Largely ditching the garage rock riffs and distortion that comprised 2015’s   on   Hot Flash Heat Wave settle into something much softer and more relaxed. There’s a passing resemblance to the jangly sound of early Mac DeMarco, with a stronger emphasis on early Beatles-esque harmonies. It helps that the group is something of a vocalist triple-threat: bassist Ted Davis and guitarists Nathaniel Blüm and Adam Abildgaard each take lead vocals for about a third of the album apiece. The trade-off gives the album variety: Davis’s tortured screams power the punky “Bye Bye Baby,” and Abildgaard’s laid-back crooning glide across “San Francisco Dating Life.” Produced by Jeff Saltzman (who also helmed The Killers’  ),   feels brighter, cleaner, and more spacious—especially when compared to  ’s tense rumble. Album highlights like “Raindrop” and “Gold Years” view past relationships through the lens of nostalgia. “Remember the nights and all the dreams we had that made us who we are,” goes the opening of “Gold Years,” “All those years, talking ‘bout the future seemed like speeding cars that drove right past.” The chorus aches to reclaim all the heady emotion of the past, hoping to “never let them go” again.

His voice was like some Dylan phase that never quite came to pass, and he wrote songs that could fold into one’s life with ease, as if they’d always just been there. Nau was actually a veteran songwriter by the time of  ’s release—he fronted the playful and complex Page France and the more melancholy and rootsy Cotton Jones—but on his first outing under his own name, he stripped away the showier aspects of his writing and presented a startlingly pure, straightforward vision. The songs on  had more in common with jazz standards than most of the music being written by Nau’s contemporaries. All of which creates significant pressure for Nau’s follow-up,  . When you’ve stripped your songs down to their sweet and slightly psychedelic essence, where do you go from there? Nau’s answer to this question is to broaden his sound while using his lyrics to reflect on the notion of change.   successfully expands the sonic palette of   without sacrificing its predecessor’s soulful feel. It starts out familiar enough: Opener “Good Thing” is a groovy meditation on nature and pleasure elevated to the realm of the spiritual by some “Chariots of Fire”-esque piano chords; “I Root” is an endearing, big-picture love song that recalls Harry Nilsson’s “Everybody’s Talkin.” But later, Nau brings in a few less-expected elements, like the distorted breakbeat on the instantly-hummable “How You’re So For Real,” the queasy vocal filter on “Scatter,” and the sweaty blues guitar licks and skronky saxophone freakouts of “The Load.” The record journeys from the expected into the mysterious, but Nau is a trustworthy guide who brings melody and humanity to every track. Smooth and stoney singer-songwriter dudes abound in the 2010s, and it takes a lot to stand out in a canon that often feels as if it were built for blending in. In Nau’s case, the difference is in the songwriting. His songs bear new fruit on each repeated listen: Sometimes it’s a half-buried counter-melody, sometimes it’s in a subtle turn of phrase. This is generous, full-hearted music. Hardened music fans and critics complain that there’s nothing new under the sun, but true magic happens when a talented songwriter finds something new within   Michael Nau has nailed that trick twice in a row. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-michael-nau-some-twist"}

The album doesn’t really sound like free jazz, but then, it doesn’t fit neatly into any other genre, either. Grimm’s songs are pretty and fractured, moving from acoustic lyricism to clanking dissonance and feedback, as her lyrics slide from personal confession to semi-occult oddness. The opening track, “Ah Love Is Oceanic Pleasure,” sounds like a Gaelic keen against atmospheric pulsing, hissing, squeaking horror movie backgrounds—like Enya slowly being driven mad by Syd Barrett. “Ah love is oceanic pleasure / No race to finish life / And if I love you at my leisure / Give it time,” she sings, before launching into tarot card references. “Beautifully Alone” is completely different—like folk via Motown, a pop song about longing for solitude rather than some guy. “When I’m alone with you / I realize our love isn’t real,” she sings cheerfully before “doo-doo-doo”s come in, and the track swings back and forth between praises of love and “dreaming a dream of my own.” “So many images tangled in my head,” she wails, throwing in an incongruous rockabilly growl. It’s sweetly innocent and unsettlingly desperate all at once. “Fear Transforms into Love” is a psychedelic lament, with feedback hum, a slow Eastern-tinged beat, horns squiggling, and Grimm declaring, “Love turns into pain / I will try not to love you again / I will try not to care.” “I Don’t Believe You” is about sexual assault;  . The track is beautifully layered, with Grimm’s own voice multi-tracked, as she sings bitterly, “I wish that I could die / I wish that you would die too.” She touches on similar material in the title track, where her dissonant roars open up: “My heart is empty / My soul is empty too / I feel dead inside / Don’t you?” feels like a record that shattered and then was reassembled painstakingly from its jagged bits.

Hammerman’s main project is the death metal band Fractured Insanity, where his work is solid but not especially distinctive within the subgenre’s conventions. Svartsyn’s looser, blackened structure gives him a chance to stretch his tentacles. His sound is surprisingly crisp, and dare we say it, ferally swinging. “The White Mask” opens with throbbing feedback pulse until Hammerman comes in with an itchy, solid beat, anchoring shifting grooves in the bleak murk. On “Dark Prophet,” he alternates blast beats with precise, dry, almost syncopated thwacks.

It wouldn’t be difficult to fill a page in admiration of Halo’s lyrical prowess. On “Jelly,” the album’s first single, her descriptions of detached emotions and reactive judgement within a relationship crisis are harrowing.

If you’re a fan of his work with Sic Alps and  , you know what you’re going to get: curving melodies with subtle hooks and Donovan’s world-weary croons. But you never know exactly how you’re going to get it. It could appear as brightly-polished pop, downbeat acoustic folk, fuzzy guitar jamming, or disjointed lo-fi collage. Whatever mode Donovan enters, he rarely stays there for long. On Donovan’s second Peacers album,  , we get all of the above and more. On their 2015 self-titled debut, the Peacers were a duo with Donovan and   label mate Ty Segall, but now the group is a four-piece including Fresh & Onlys bassist Shayde Sartin (Segall is no longer involved). Expanding the lineup seems to have freed Donovan to explore his wide musical toolbox even further, resulting in the most sonically diverse effort of his career. It’s odd to say this about such patient, measured music, but in many ways   is a 17-track roller coaster. The thrill is in the juxtapositions. Donovan loves to swerve from one tone to its opposite, stringing together songs that sound pretty similar but feel totally different. He’ll swing from the classic-sounding “D.T.M.T.Y.C.Y.M.,” which could pass for a Big Star outtake, to the reddened guitar squall of “Robot Flame,” then dip down into “Windy Car,” an acoustic-heavy ballad so subdued it sounds like Low playing around a campfire. The most carefully crafted gem on  , the swaying “Theme From Sonny,” feels lifted from a ‘60s folk-pop compilation—which, of course, means Donovan follows with the shambling guitar of a distorted one-minute ditty called “On Matt.” Many bands would kill to come up with just one song as catchy as “Theme From Sonny,” but for Donovan, no single tune is an end in itself. The best way to listen to   is to think of each track as another stepping stone toward Donovan’s weird vision of musical nirvana, a place where any sound goes but it all sounds good. —", "genre": ["Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-peacers-introducing-the-crimsmen-review"}

Through these projects, Elkington became a go-to collaborator for many Chicago musicians and carved out a personal range of styles that land somewhere in the gray between traditional English folk, scrappy Midwestern indie rock, and Chicago post-rock. The latter fastened him to the city’s improvised music scene in the early years of the 21st century and served as a powerful opportunity to rub elbows with a network of composers from both classical and less formal vernaculars.

But then the EP gets dark, and for those of us who’ve gone through some rough, depressive moments, it all hits close to home on the track “David.” Here, Dunn muses: “Answering the phone / Closing the door / Everything feels awfully empty for David.” Hearing those words set to pausing tones brings a sense calm and hurt; the singer begs for someone,  , to “just give him something to believe in.” After so many listens, one doesn’t feel sad, but rather hopeful that someone close to David can help him find a way through the abyss.

The stormy sonics mirror Wilson’s nagging doubts: “Who will take care of me?” she asks on “Is This Real,” a line that echoes the concerns of their 2014 single “Your Street” (“Will you still want me when I’m old and frail?”).

There is carnage on this record. The hooks express consequence: death is not a cold-blooded aberration, it’s the daily forecast. Produced entirely by Blockhead,   is a sobering record, which isn’t surprising given much of woods’s catalogue. And yet, even in its bleakest moments, there’s a concerted effort to be playful on tracks like “Police Came To My Show,” “Groundhogs Day,” and the intro to “Fall Back,” where woods laments his second-class status in a woman’s heart. “Police Came To My Show” dials into a “ ” levity, subverting the anti-blue stance in rap: the cops pay the cover price to get in, stay for a while, and dip before his last verse.

This isn’t the first time woods and Blockhead have teamed up. 2013’s   helped elevate woods out of New York’s underground anonymity, and gave Blockhead the foundation to grapple with the rapper’s voluble style. With  , Blockhead embellishes the production—like on “Washington Redskins,” where he blends grungy bass, somber horns, and sampled chants. Elsewhere, Blockhead pairs woods with brooding bass lines presumably lifted from African psych-rock. Think of it as a melting pot of New York rap, an unflinching backdrop for woods’s pithy character sketches. In fact, psychedelia gestates within the production like a bad trip, while a few delicate melodies attempt to reconcile the terror. Woods is joined by  ,  , and his other half to Armand Hammer,  , but it’s the vocal samples that compliment his message the most, whether it’s Ghostface’s “my heart is cold like Russia” on “Source Awards,” or the voice of MF DOOM on “Keloid” with the lament “Born alone / Die alone / No matter who your man is.” A solemn way to live, but there’s no escaping the anguish. —", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/billy-woods-known-unknowns-album-review"}

There are subtle nods toward the early days of indie rock—the hi-distortion approach of Superchunk and Archers of Loaf, the bent-wire guitars of Polvo and Helium—but not a second of  feels derivative or, worse, nostalgic. Instead, Aye Nako start with a familiar template and then smudge and redraw it according to their own designs. The world in which these songs exist is, realistically, a dangerous one. “Tell me what I need to stay safe on the streets” goes the chorus to “Sissy,” and the slow-creeping “Nightcrawler,” with its spider-leg guitars, imagines “exorcism on a billboard stage” and “false needles in my neck.” In the roiling “The Gift of Hell,” the protagonist ends up “drinking with statues at Grand Army Plaza,” and the bitter sentiment is paired with a big, soaring melody. The oppositional stance is key to who Aye Nako are—passionate believers in the value of DIY spaces, who seek to operate outside the commerce-driven music scene. They grapple often with identity—the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality operate in differing ways for the four band members, and exploring these traumas together provides a sense of healing—and they distill their anger, frustration, and iconoclasm into songs that feel urgent and vital. That the songs on   are so unfailingly melodic makes their lyrics land that much harder. A skipping guitar trips along the background of “Spare Me” before the song erupts into full-throated howl; “The Gift of Hell” juxtaposes 20-ton stoner riffs with a haunting, delicate vocal line. And “Tourmaline” is a mini-epic, moving from a slow-gliding opening to a knottier, more fitful middle section. It’s this kind of restlessness and inventiveness that makes   such a gripping listen. It lulls you into comfort before turning the room upside down. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/aye-nako-silver-haze-review"}

But that’s not to say that   is likely to score radio airplay anytime soon. Rebecca “FIN” Simonetti is a New York multimedia artist—in one   she hung a replica of a lamb from the ceiling with harnesses; blobby, pink, flower-shaped objects sprung from its carcass. Her music has a bit of that same horror-film ruthlessness. She approaches pop from a clinical distance, slicing it up then smiling as it staggers forward. On “In Silver,” she whispers “Tik tik tik” at the beginning of the track, then chops her voice up and adds multitracked layers, creating both calculated bliss and blissful calculation. “Gutshot” heads towards Danielle Dax territory, with spacey, clattering power chords, and a beat that walks onto the dance floor to sway with the vampires. “Daughters” is built around a tinkling music box motif which turns into a siren-like electronic industrial clamor; it sounds like an infant crawling through a steel mill. The lyric, “Put your hands in the air, I’ll cut them off with a knife,” nicely sums up FIN’s aesthetic. FIN takes similar cues from performers like Björk and FKA twigs, who use arty dissonance and broken beats to heighten emotional intensity and create deeper personal expression. But FIN’s vision owes more to Kraftwerk, ferreting out the alienating, artificial clockwork at modern pop’s heart.", "genre": ["Pop", "R&B", "avant-garde"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/fin-ice-pix-review"}

That’s not necessarily out of the ordinary: The brothers exhibited similarly pensive tendencies in the   of their beloved ’90s band Bedhead, and the New Year’s 2008 self-titled effort was full of dusky elegies. But   is particularly bereft, as it features subtle and rewarding sonic progressions with bittersweet undertones. “Mayday” sighs with resignation, courtesy of majestic electric guitars that grow more agitated as the song unfolds—the sound matches the discord hinted at in the lyrics: “Searching the coffers/For empty offers/I don’t know why/You trust the sky/You must like your lies from blue eyes.” The louder, insistent “The Party’s Over” incorporates anxious doubled guitars and crisp rhythmic slaps, while the languid “Homebody” sticks to the kind of foggy textures and melodies favored by Pavement, Silver Jews, and ’90s-era Built to Spill. Yet   is remarkable not because of its inspirations, but because of its execution. The record boasts elaborate arrangements that make songs feel deliberately and methodically sculpted into shape. The largely instrumental “Myths” swells with dense, interwoven elements—acoustic guitar, salt-shaker percussion, pointed electric melodies and moments of stark sparseness—until the vocals emerge near the end. “The Beast,” meanwhile, starts off as an ears-ringing, droning electric number (think: a hazier Dinosaur Jr.), but suddenly morphs into an immersive song where choppy waves of guitar become subservient to lullaby-like keyboards. The title track and “The Last Fall” are also both softened by solemn electric piano—the latter, with its tangled heap of Chris Brokaw drums and lively melody, is almost jazz-like in its execution. These complexities often amplify  s emotional dismay, especially because Matt Kadane’s vocals are a seamless part of this sonic fabric. On some songs, his voice is submerged in the mix, creating wrenching ambiguity. On “Homebody,” moments of clarity (“No one can see me, I left my body at home/He likes to stay there alone”) alternate with lyrics where the last word drops out (“I can’t get home tonight, I can’t stand on my own two…”), obscuring the line’s meaning. Instead of being frustrating, however, this only adds to the record’s aura of mystery and austerity. In the end,   conjures the kind of grim meditations that arise in the dead of night, when the insomniac combination of restless fatigue and anxiety sweeps through and magnify the mind’s most desolate corners. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-new-year-snow-review"}

But mostly,   is about Foon and the way she stretches her instrument and her voice, about the textures she builds up. It is one woman making a musical case that is both elegiac and urgent, so it’s almost jarring to hear another voice emerge on “Light of Mercy” when former Silver Mt.

That alone is enough to freight the record with an encyclopedia of ideas, everything from Manifest Destiny to colonialism to the simple idea of an “untamed land” waiting—both ominously and expectantly—for new settlers. What makes the entirely-instrumental   so enthralling is that it never tips over into literalism; there are no prairie whistles or lap steels or cleverly-chosen vocal samples. Instead, Gonzalez explores the idea of travel, transition, and the “Myth of America” through feints and suggestions, with spiderwebs of piano and billowing synths. The steadily-chugging “Hidden Song” is cleft in two by a rude, cutting electric guitar, which slices up the center of Gonzalez’s motorik backdrop like an inebriated guest at a formal dinner party. The elements cohere gradually, the precise arrangements of Krautrock—its lockstep rhythm, waterfall of piano, and bobbing bassline—gradually subsuming the slashing riffs into themselves. The collision of elements, and the acclimation of one to another, feels packed with portent. The title track is full of shadow and space; Gonzalez sketches out a skeletal piano figure, layering linen-like synths on top of it for an end result that feels mournful and isolated. “Roulette,” with its dewdrop guitars and gradually-building rhythm, is expectant and apprehensive all at once. And album-closer “Vesuvius” covers throbbing techno with black-cloud drones, synths sparkling and vanishing like lightning in the background.

Loose Tooth is one of the shining lights of that stylistically diverse Philly scene, and their sophomore LP,  , makes the case for them being at the head of the pack.  is a hard record to nail down: its sunny, Pavement-esque side—underscored by Kian Sorouri’s half-spoken, half melodically shouted vocals—is effectively countered by post-punk chugging and some genuinely dark turns (see the death-centric “Day Old Glory” and the tense “Little Blue”). That slipperiness is really what keeps Loose Tooth from feeling like ’90s revivalists, and it’s also what drives and elevates the whole record. There’s a fascinating tension here between the band’s titular looseness and and straight-up headbanging passages: Songs like “Free Skate” and “Roach Motel” open like free jazz, unfurling as soon as they’re born, and then—just before dissolution—find a powerful groove to get stuck in. Lyrically, too, Loose Tooth is comfortable being both earnest and playful. If anything, that’s the mission statement outlined on opener “Sleep With The State Concept,” where Sorouri sings, “This is how it goes with matters of great importance / I forget, and go out for a ride.” All of this swinging can cause a little motion sickness, which feels both fully appropriate for the times and like a natural progression from the tidier stylistic about-faces on Loose Tooth’s previous LP,  .   is the sound of a band growing into itself, and having a lot of fun doing it.

DeMarco is struck by his growing resemblance to his father on opener “My Old Man,” which pairs a pinging drum machine beat with a rich acoustic guitar part. The spare, whispery “Sister” plays like a heartsick apology, but DeMarco doesn’t milk it: the song is over in less than 90 seconds. The quiet, effects-treated guitar and DeMarco’s somber voice give the track an air of heavy sadness, but not everything on the album is such a garment-render. “Baby You’re Out” bobs along on a sunny mix of acoustic guitar and bassy synths as DeMarco counsels against regret, while “A Wolf Who Wears Sheeps Clothes” alternates his vocals with harmonica layered over a thick, rubbery guitar riff. Though these 13 songs are steeped in nuance, DeMarco’s fondness for gauzy soft-rock aesthetics makes some of the guitar riffs and drum patterns similar enough on the surface that it can take a while before the tunes sink in. As a result, the album drags here and there, and some of the most obvious differences among tracks come in DeMarco’s choice of synth tones: so bright it’s almost brittle on “For the First Time,” or klaxon-like on the domineering father-son pep talk “On the Level.” Despite the occasional dips in momentum,   is worth diving into.

Ditto “The Pot is on Fire,” which takes disco to the Caribbean, steel drums clattering frantically around a polyester groove. The aptly-named “Quiet” is stark and haunting, frontwoman Eno Williams working her voice slowly through an icicle-drip guitar line. Indeed, it’s Williams who anchors the record.

The sound of classic outlaw country and a singular sense of determination are in evidence throughout, not only in the ragged-yet-rollicking rhythms that drive such offerings as “Keep the Home Fires Burnin’,” “The Nail,” and “Make It Up to Mama,” but also in the titles of the songs themselves. “Misery Without Company,” “Nothin’ Feels Right But Doin’ Wrong,” and “Fuck Up” all suggest that Shook’s instincts have a habit of leading her astray.

While Shook spends plenty of time taking stock of her actions, she occasionally skews introspective.

Music—particularly sample-based music—reflects this; with the advent of mashups and memes, all media has become fair game for recycling and re-use, a process that, at its worst, flattens all of its source sounds, images, and ideas into an endless barrage of kitsch. On the surface, it would be easy to mistake Chicago-based electronic producer/multi-instrumentalist   for just another mashup artist. On  , her second album under the pseudonym  , Marcloid combines blood-curdling black metal howls with the kind of bubblegum synth-pop that used to soundtrack VHS workout videos in the ’80s. Yes, Marcloid plays up the contrast between those two elements for maximum absurdity, but   is more than just an orgy of stimulation. Campy and disturbing at the same time, the album illuminates, challenges, and ultimately makes art out of our relationship with media. The samples on   bob and weave in the music like loose space junk—a reverb-drenched smooth-jazz saxophone figure, courtesy of Richard Elliott, pings against an iconic riff by math metal outfit  ; a punchline delivered by cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants brushes shoulders with a spooky voice whispering “Look behind you,” a sample from a Halloween item she saw at a big box store.  creates an almost dementia-like effect by wrenching its various samples free from any context. Marcloid has been releasing music for years under a host of monikers, including ambient titles like last year’s   And while she draws from a harsher, denser palette on  , her affinity for wide-open soundscapes shines through all the abrasiveness, binding together the music’s disparate sounds. On opening track “Subconscious Pilsen Relics Pt 2 [CODENAME_AIRPLANE MODE],” Elliott’s saxophone decays into a vaporous swirl that, for a few seconds at least, aspires to the majesty of, say, Vangelis’   score. The album is just as effective when it gets ugly. Marcloid’s muffled screams of the words “I dreamt that every man who didn’t fight for me was shot” at the end of “All Deth is U [CODENAME_FINAL TOUCH LOCATION]” cut through the darkness, evoking a violent kind of anguish. It is in moments like these, or when Marcloid sings that “Guns don’t kill people unless the guns are me/ In a sea of semen a slug can still be free,” that   is at its most disturbingly provocative and, paradoxically, its most human. Throughout, Marcloid references early-’90s artifacts of internet and computer culture—a sound evoking the familiar   that once announced a new e-mail message, the fonts and the tower-style PC that grace the album cover—but she operates in a universe wholly separate from smiley-faced chiptune artists who romanticize dated media formats.

She extends that grace both to herself and then to the listener throughout her band’s self-titled LP. Each song is a conversation, although it’s unclear whether Jacobs is talking herself, a lover, or to us. This is part of the record’s essential charm—the uncertainty creates a funhouse of mirrors that face both outside and in. On opener “If You Let It,” Jacobs chants “You deserve more” over and over; she could be coaching a distraught listener, but she could also be repeating a mantra to herself—one of those intimate fantasy conversations you rehearse in your mind in order to steel yourself for the real thing. Like the High Priestess tarot card, Jacob’s conceals knowledge, leaving the answer up for interpretation. Taken altogether,   is about embracing the beauty and freedom of Jacobs’ own impurity, like when she declares that she “can’t sit on your white couches tonight” or teases a lover for believing she’s a “peach/ to be plucked from the wing of the tree/ ripened and ready to be consumed.” On that song, she’s a bitch, she’s a lover, etc. etc. The songs on   could fit neatly into the folk singer-songwriter tradition, but the structures are unusual, meandering melodically, augmented by vocal yips and yelps that punctuate Jacobs’ observations—call it the Newsom effect. She also employs various guitar tones and added electronic elements, a la Beth Orton, which give depth to her unusual compositions. Unlike much of the singer-songwriter canon,   is unapologetically epic and self-aggrandizing. ”Don’t let my moxie embitter your tongue,” she sings playfully on “Moxie,” a declaration of pride in her own impropriety.  Later, she sings, ”You could not give me what was mine/ Had to free my body and my mind,” as the song builds up gradually behind her, almost as if she’s ascending a grand staircase, rising above the disdain of anyone would have her hold her tongue and deny herself pleasure. “Experience made the one that you love,” she chides. Jacobs excels at clever wordplay and metaphors too intimidating to be cutesy: “This thread between us/ I can’t wind through the spool/like the knot’s caught,” she sings on “Spool,” an ode to a recalcitrant lover who can’t (or won’t) keep up. With her spritely mix of humor, passion, and unexpectedly mischievous approach to songwriting, Jacobs has created an exceptionally generous, unselfish record, an invitation to revel in its lightness of being. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/thelma-review"}

Yet, no matter how disparate the styles, the record never sounds disjointed. Instead, it’s held together by the band’s well-honed melodic sensibilities and their obvious familiarity with and reverence for each genre’s individual conventions—all of which they fold seamlessly into their own bright and shiny sound. The bell-clear vocals of bassist Rose Vastola are a highlight throughout, recalling the bubbly yet sharply-defined tenor of fellow Floridian Allison Mosshart.  may be an easy listen, but underneath all the ear candy is a record of serious substance. The heart of   is centered on the quiet peace that comes after illusions have been shattered, and the acceptance that comes from facing adversity head on. “Never knowing what I’m doing tears me apart,” Vastola sings on opener “Wasting Away”; by the time the band arrives at the title track, she has found a kind of stillness in sitting alone amidst the wreckage of a bad situation now overcome. “I am grateful for the past and all the friends didn’t last,” she sings, lingering over the litany of experiences that have shaped her current situation while expressing gratitude for the sun that “shines through my glass home.” It’s not melancholy so much as wistful and, ultimately, wise—a song that celebrates the serenity that comes from battles hard fought and lessons well learned on a record that embraces the evergreen enchantment of three chords going around and around and around. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-uv-tv-glass"}

During its creation, he cut himself off from the news and from external distractions, in order to focus solely on writing recording. And yet the resulting album,  , is a furious, snarling beast, a record that scans as an explicit reaction to recent political developments. And while Power has always had a knack for visceral, explosive music—either with Blanck Mass, or as one half of Fuck Buttons—  ’s tracks are longer, more brooding and far more menacing than anything that’s come before. The frenzied, violent electronics of “Rhesus Negative,” which features a hard techno beat and mangled vocaloid effects, is countered by the comparative quietness of “Silent Treatment.” But even that song is shot through with shadow: taking its name from a form of manipulative punishment, there are clear hints of anger boiling just below its surface, threatening to erupt at any moment. Powers’ voice is one of the record’s crucial components. Though sometimes manipulated until they’re unrecognizable, they give the record emotional weight, providing the audience with a human element at the center of the chaos. Other times, it’s layered, for an effect that’s sometimes warm and communal and other times sharp and violent. “Hive Mind,” which closes the album, is perhaps the clearest example of the latter. Powers’ lead vocal is slow and mournful, and is eventually drowned out by a crowd of yelling voices. It’s a combination open to a variety of interpretations: Powers’ lone voice could represent the isolation that comes when a nation seems to push in a direction you don’t agree with. Or, the group vocals could represent protest—determined fights to fix a broken system. It’s an ambiguous conclusion to be sure, but a fitting end to a record that rewards and punishes in equal measure. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/blanck-mass-world-eater-review"}

It’s the first sound to appear on the record, cutting a jagged course across the center of album-opener “Palm of Hand,” swerving between the loose rhythm, speeding up and slowing down at will. While the band   austere post-punkers Wire as a specific influence on  , the music here has none of that group’s coldness; instead,   is—mostly—bright and upbeat, demonstrating the same grasp of light, airy melody as New Zealanders The Bats. Indeed, the gorgeous, gently-pulsing chorus of “Don’t Wanna Know You” sounds like it could have been lifted from that band’s back catalogue. That ease is especially significant given that   was born of struggle and almost sandbagged by overthinking. The band’s rising profile in their home city caused principal songwriters Balla and Mikey Wells to panic, concerned their writing wasn’t matching the increased attention. But instead of doubling-down on that anxiety, on  , the band moves in the other direction, letting songs unfold slowly and deliberately. The haunting, slow-build title track moves from a simple nest of guitars to a big, churning finale, Wells and Balla stretching a single sung note as the band heaves away behind them. “Everybody Warned You” is a tender, sad-eyed ballad that clears out its middle section for a twirling, melodic guitar solo. Even the album’s tenser moments put the guitar way out front—the pogo-ing “Prove,” which recalls the nervous energy of early Parquet Courts, bounces on a taut coil of guitar. They even manage to make the album’s few moments of darkness sound optimistic. On the bitter music-industry kiss-off “Buried on the Moon,” a leaping guitar lead offsets the acid in the song’s chorus: “Come on, make a record like your dear old dad/ We’ll give you all the money and make you feel sad.”   may be the product of that Faustian deal, but the results are anything but melancholy. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ne-hi-offers-review"}

On last year’s  , she cast the relationship between the individual and the state as that of an abusive father/child dynamic. On her new EP, the titular paradise she envisages is one where masculine authority, the unequivocal source of ecocide and injustice, has been overthrown and destroyed. On the vaporous “In My Dreams,” the realization that an unnamed figure neither loves nor wants the best for her dawns on ANOHNI while she sleeps. The song fades from earshot, but the seeds have been planted. “My father’s hand rests on my throat,” she croons on the title track, while “Enemy” picks up where  ‘s “Violent Men” left off, lamenting the condition of birthing one’s own subjugator. In other words, if the ideological force and authority invested in fatherhood is the generator of oppression then, as the popular left-wing Twitter meme of five years ago might have it, “ ” is a political necessity. ’s six songs were recorded in the same sessions as  ; it’s a companion piece, rather than a sequel. But there’s an optimism here that was lacking on its unremittingly bleak predecessor. “Paradise” is frenetic and turbulent—Hudson Mohawke’s maximalist production, such a superb fit for the drama of ANOHNIi’s voice, zigs and zags like lasers here. But it also explicitly seeks to bury despair, and ANOHNI’s performance reflects it: her “ooh-ooh-ooh!” as she gears up for the song’s final climax is one of the most spontaneous, joyful ad libs of her career. Elsewhere, she derives power from naming the opposition: “You’re a mean old man,” she sneers on the distorted, vengeful “Jesus Will Kill You.” Even “Enemy” blossoms from mourning into tense but glorious chorales. The political agenda ANOHNI began on   took explicit aim at the neoliberal, drone-bombing Obama administration, but her themes feel more relevant than ever now. The urgency of her resistance is encapsulated in “Ricochet,” ostensibly a weary, pleading cry against possible reincarnation. But beneath the fist she shakes at God is an acceptance of the here and now, the need to be fully present in order to fight. Utopia doesn’t come easily for ANOHNI on  , but simply imagining the possibility is the first step towards it. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/anohni-paradise-review"}

Throughout their third album,  , the Los Angeles outfit—primarily the vehicle of Jackson Wargo—serves up one sparkling power-pop gem after another, all of them powered by immaculate, high-stacked vocal harmonies and sterling silver guitars. Think of it as a long-delayed sequel to Teenage Fanclub’s  : big, ringing songs that mask wry, observational lyrics. Album opener “Anais & Me” is the ideal exhibit A: in each verse, Wargo speculates about the life of an invisible protagonist, filling each line with tiny, specific details (“I’ll bet you’re blowing off your curfew/puffing smokes in mists of perfume/ I’ll bet your daddy’s a fascist/ and that you piss him off in Spanish”) before gliding into the song’s gleaming-gold chorus. In “Sear ‘Em!” Wargo’s heartsick tenor floats over crashing drums and slashing guitars, a push-pull dynamic that defines much of  . The guitars stay serrated and cutting, but Wargo gingerly stacks vocal harmonies 10-stories high on top of them, like a man engaged in some perilous game of musical Jenga. The chords that drive “Resident of the United States” claw and punch, but Wargo’s voice struts up the center, spit-shined and unscathed. Mostly,   feels like a field guide to writing perfect pop songs—which is, in itself, an accomplishment. Other artists who attempt such straightforward hitmaking end up with music that’s either cloying or boring. Snowball ii prove that there’s still life in familiar formats—you just have to be driven enough to look for it. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/snowball-ii-flashes-of-quincy-review"}

Its 10 songs seem to document a grueling breakup, but what makes the record so rattling is that all of the resulting agony is focused inward. Where 2015’s   was stacked with bruising hardcore,  is both paradoxically more measured and more tortured. Opener “Fur Sale” sails out on a sleek sheet of melodic guitars, and frontman Morgan Fox isn’t screaming but singing. But about two minutes in, the turbulence hits: “Nothing compares to you,” Fox sings, “But I still compare everything to you.” From there it’s a quick dive into dissonance; the guitars turn pitch black and Morgan doubles over howling. The rest of the record volleys between those two poles, post-hardcore melodicism trading off with proper-hardcore panic attacks. “Majestic Face” manages both at once, eerie vocal harmonies gliding across heart-attack double-bass drumming. In “Old Hiss,” Fox runs into his old flame in public, which sends him into a spiral of despair: “We’ll grow old together,” he wails as the band pitches and rolls behind him, “Right up until I wake up.” Even when the band stretches out musically, the results are shot through with unease. The sparse “Peach,” is built on a skeletal strum and lit up with squiggles of synthesizer that sound like an MRI machine melting down. And while the band’s ventures into melodicism demonstrate impressive breadth, it’s the full-throated ragers that land the hardest. The panicked “Subsequent Rips” opens with Fox declaring “I write myself a heartfelt love letter/ and read it into the mirror,” against chaotic corkscrews of guitar; both elements are operating in their own time signature: Fox plows forward regardless of meter; the band hammers away chaotically, like they’re falling down a flight of stairs.   trepans down into the center of heartbreak and records all of the mayhem it finds there.

But the records also took enough liberties with that grim metal subgenre that the band seemed a prime candidate for crossover. Those departures have grown only stronger on  , the third full-length from the Little Rock, Arkansas, quartet. Throughout, Pallbearer moves even further away from easy definitions and constraining pigeonholes. Some may call it compromise; others may call it growing up. The most intriguing thing about the self-produced   is the constant tension churning within both the words and the music. Their lyrics, while still mostly bleak, now leave a little room for cautious hope (“A Plea for Understanding” even features the word “love”). And while still capable of of producing a crushing swing, the band isn’t afraid to unleash a confident, unabashed melodic sensibility; at times, Pallbearer sounds like classic Thin Lizzy, or even Boston (bassist Joseph Rowland wasn’t shy about his enjoyment of the latter in a  ). You can hear it in Brett Campbell’s agile singing, easing up into a high register free of the self-conscious “woe is me” despair of so many doom vocalists. You can hear it in guitarist Devin Holt’s mastery of both massive riffage and lovely, proggy lines that flirt with power metal.   sounds like a band finally free to be itself.

Since then, the band spent several years touring the country, and several more resting in Canada as they retreated from their status as indie guitar-music saviors. Much has stayed the same on  , the band’s third album. Like its predecessor, it also contains eight songs, many of which still run in the four-minute range, and most of which still deal with, in one form or another, negotiating compromised dreams and early-middle aged adult restlessness. There are scattered new musical approaches, though: more acoustic guitar, some synths here and there, a new reliance on slower tempos, and a seven-plus minute progrock epic called “Arc of Bar.” Singer/guitarist Brian King and drummer-vocalist Dave Prowse still have a way of instilling magic with not much more than a few chords and some earnest romanticism: “A whirlwind, a woman and a famous feeling” is how they put it on “No Known Drink or Drug,” one of many songs on   that sets forth an altogether new thesis for Japandroids: that dedication to a future of long-term love can be just as thrilling and worthy of sing-along celebration as bemoaning what once was. On the album-closer “In a Body Like a Grave,” the band further embraces its newfound maturity, channeling Springsteen with an anthem of communal resilience that extols the hard work of persisting through the dark troubles life inevitably throws your way. At some point, the song seems to say, we’ll all have to recover some long-buried faith: “Gather the gang, and make that night,” King sings, “an ultimatum to the universe: fuck or fight.” —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/japandroids-near-to-the-wild-heart-of-life-review"}
{"img": null, "album": "Meet You", "artist": "Century Palm", "description": "Toronto’s  could have only been born in a blistering Canadian winter. Dark, taut, icy and slick, their debut album   is a crash course in post-punk—there’s some Krautrock influence, like the Neue Deutsche Welle bands, plus hints of goth. They adopt the angular guitars of Wire and The Fall, the deep emotionality of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, and even the pop sensibility of Devo and The B-52’s, while maintaining a distinct identity of their own. Simply put, Century Palm have crafted an irony-free study of ’80s independent rock that is simultaneously fresh and immediately nostalgic. After a few opening tracks set the shadowy stage,   starts to take shape with “Then You’re Gone,” a breakneck tune that frenetically builds upon itself thanks to a rhythm section as tight as piano wire, spiraling upwards and falling back down again with expert precision. A manic keyboard line is scribbled over the top, giving the track an even more frantic and rattled dimension. In addition to the sound and structure of the songs themselves, frontman Andrew Payne runs the gamut of brooding punk vocal styles, perhaps unintentionally, yet charismatically, nailing many key reference points: at times he echoes Ian Curtis’ booming bass, or Howard Devoto’s blasé snarl. “Walk Forever Blind,” another highlight, kicks off with heavy synths droning into space, until the drum beat lumbers into the mix and Payne delivers the line: “I’ll walk forever blind/ Over the hills of time/ It is the only way,” like a man who has finally discovered the meaning of life, but is too depressed to let us in on the secret. It’s not that   is a direct homage to or pastiche of any of these bands; its connect-the-dots approach in such an expressive and expansive genre is part of what makes it a joy to listen to.

While Dear claims he has countless hours of raw material lying around, the process of putting it all together—of turning madness into music—often takes years. That goes for everything from his feral techno guise   to the avant-pop albums Dear cuts under his own name. Nearly five years have passed since the last one ( ), with little indication of that lull ending anytime soon. In the meantime, Dear has snuck a lone new track into his mix for the  series. Lurking near the starting gate, right after a pensive   piece, is “Wrong With Us,” an exclusive that questions everything. “As time goes on, I don’t know what more we can do,” Dear sings over one of his signature melancholic dance melodies. “The world keeps changing, but when has that ever been news?” A fair question, but it doesn’t take long for Dear to brush it off and dive headlong into bonkers tracks like  ‘s ravishing Caserta remix, Decius’ sinister “Bread & Butter” single, and a cold-pressed collab between Doc Daneeka and Gwilym Gold (“Lust For Sale”).

Fla.mingo’s debut album, is the rare example of a record where the line between vaporwave and another genre—in this case, synth pop—is almost completely annihilated. The New York-based producer seamlessly melds the two to create a powerful ode to lost innocence, youth, and love. It all starts sweetly, with openers “Fantasy” and “Everything Felt So Right” recalling the sugary bubble-gum optimism of Fla.mingo’s August EP  . But the album quickly pivots to wistfulness and stays there, using brooding synths and distant vocal samples on  tracks like “浮く” and “Heartache2” to evoke a wounded, broken romanticism. The keening, high-pitched electronics that end “Die”—as well as the echoing, spaced-out textures of “Depression Dive”—perfectly illustrate this emotion,  the far-off vocals pining after some departed love.

It’s not too surprising—he began hinting at this approach as far back as 2012’s  . And while   may leave some fans yearning for the immediate gratification of Marion’s gargantuan, shrieking guitar work, the payoff here is much greater. Marion rarely sings on his records; instead, he uses a wide range of tones and effects to turn his electric guitar—often played with a slide—into a voice of its own. On past albums, Marion used drums, keyboards and other guitars to create a neutral backdrop for his soaring riffs. On  , those other instruments move to the forefront, melding seamlessly with Marion’s guitar on tracks like “Tomorrow” and “Swimming” for a sturdier, more balanced sound. On the album’s second side in particular, sweet, humid piano figures provide a smart and gentle counterpoint to Marion’s quivering notes. Which is not to say that  is a sleepy affair. Opening track “Animals” channels the psych-y swirl of past tour mates Tame Impala, and the blasting “Cartoon Rock,” true to its name, is an unabashed roller-coaster of crunching riffs that bears a delightful resemblance to Deerhoof’s recent  .

Simplicity is Moon Duo’s not-so-secret weapon. Their tracks blend the familiar concoction of guitars, a bevy of synthesizers, vocals and drum machines (helmed by touring drummer John Jeffrey). Yet their music never feels stale. Their sound exists beneath layers of haze, each acutely defined as to not overwhelm any particular part. “Will of the Devil” is a spooky midnight jam, with skyward reaching ‘80s synths and a stomping drum pattern that wouldn’t sound out of place at an NBA game.   is music for cold nights and grey mornings.

Like Os Mutantes—a group to which they bear more than a passing musical resemblance—the group’s songs are constructed around simple, urgent refrains, over which they add layers upon layers of wavy, wobbling guitar. That skill becomes all the more pronounced in the live setting, as   clearly demonstrates. Over the course of the album’s running time, the group stretches songs out to the 10-minute-mark and beyond, but never disappears into a wormhole of tuneless improvising. Take the sprawling “Tempo”: the song opens with a post-rock stutter-and-stall, its arch, angular rhythmic construction supporting sheets of feedback and amp fuzz. Gradually, the din dies away to make room for a gentle, whispery vocal melody that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Stereolab record. The song folds in on itself halfway through, wooshes of guitar and clattering drums threatening to topple the sense of tranquility. But then, just as quickly as the kaleidoscope of noise began, everything snaps back into focus, the melody returns, and the song is guided safely to shore. “Manchaca” is a loose, ambling sci-fi funk jam, with robotic synths squawking around a firmly-rooted bassline.

It sounds like my teen years in the best way possible: all the nostalgia, none of the actual pain. The Olympia, Washington-Washington D.C. ’90s punk/indie rock connection had existed through the ’80s, but was cemented by  ; coincidentally, the show mentioned in the linked Washington Post piece was also the very first punk show I ever attended (purely because I thought the flyer looked cool, not because I knew anything about any of the bands playing). From there, it grew; bands developed fruitful relationships with one another, and these two insular, peculiar outposts of independent culture grew their names and their draw in the national scene, which was considerably bigger than either city’s square footage. The sounds that developed between the two cities (and their suburbs) over the ’80s and ’90s—  and  , Unrest and  ,   and  —shifted and darkened as the sounds of the underground were snatched up by a mainstream that was hungry for the next Nirvana. It’s this era and circuit to which Soggy Creep so lovingly pay homage, without sounding exactly like any of their predecessors—they’re a little grungy, a little shambly, a little whiny, a little churny. There are the faster ones (“Forgotten Skin,” “Eradicated Man”) and the slower ones (“Shallow Drownings”), but the whole thing never strays too far from the kind of mid-tempo shuffle appropriate for a crowd with their arms crossed and their heads nodding. While their previous EPs worshipped more directly at the altar of Greg Sage, this one has an array of patron saints—we can only hope that the band will, as they suggest on their page, potentially reconvene to explore this dusty territory a bit more. Most of the ’90s-indebted bands getting press these days owe more to Pavement than they do Universal Order of Armageddon; this is a welcome stylistic change to these old ears.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/soggy-creep-shallow-drownings-review"}

In that respect, the song acts as a perfect encapsulation of the album’s aesthetic: No track is too similar, but each is made up of distinct parts that build a complicated—but cohesive—whole. Palberta met at Bard College and spent playing in and around Hudson Valley before ending up in Philadelphia. That transitory history colors the album; “Jaws” has an industrial quality that mimics the pace of a new city. “Bells,” the song that immediately follows, has a ringing, pastoral feel. New York City no-wave skronk is revitalized in the first half of “Trick Ya.” is 20 tracks long, with most songs clocking in around a minute—in other words, it goes a lot of places but it doesn’t stay in any of them for too long. Palberta are often compared to legendary acts like  and  , but on  , Palberta seem more fascinated with movement and structure than either of those groups.

The secret weapon, though, is Chura’s seen-it-all twang and her unpredictable song structures; they give her lyrics—which are often as brief as bathroom-wall aphorisms—a cutting edge. The spare “Thin,” which pairs Chura’s voice with bare-bones guitar and percussion, consists of a single verse; its central metaphor: the scratch-off surface of a lottery ticket. The glum “You” chronicles the narrator’s longing, circular admiration for someone distant, with the chiming guitars becoming more intense as Chura’s vocal blossoms slowly from sulk into yawp. On the title track, sullen guitar melodies arise from Pigpen-cloud riffs, until a multitracked Chura swoops in with words of comfort, centering the chaos. Chura’s brand of close-to-the-bone pop is intimate yet triumphant, bringing to mind the likes of Holly Golightly and Kristin Hersh. Her songs are ways out of emotional jams, with intricate guitar lines and unexpected left turns both tracing her feelings driving her poetry. It’s hardly bedroom lo-fi. Instead, the reverb on tracks like the wistful “Human Being” and the jittery “Spotted Gold” give the album the feeling of an frantic car ride, one where the destination isn’t a  , but a clearer, more assured sense of self. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/stef-chura-messes-review"}

Toronto-based ambient techno producer David Psutka, continues to push away from electronic dance music and into a less definable space between bass music, dark ambient, and New Age atmospheres. The music on   (Psutka’s second release on his own Halocline Trance label) is interwoven with field recordings of water flowing—the light babble of a stream emptying into a pool, waves steadily cascading onto shore. “Lake of Contemplation, Pool of Fundamental Bond” and “We Can Be Concrete” create a two-song suite of metallic clangs and oscillating mechanics patterned after the organic movement of a river’s rapids or an ocean’s tide. That’s not to say, though, that these pieces sound anything like their organic corollaries—Psutka’s intention is to recode the universal rhythms of earth in binary. The mechanical gloom and static compression of the first three pieces finally breaks with the title track, a balladic centerpiece with a sort of synthesized brooding core—a slow jam for cyborgs. It’s followed by “V.E.P.N.” which descends into a rainstorm of thunderous distortion and feedback while maintaining and reintroducing sonic elements drawn from the rest of the album. This use of recurring themes is a bold and striking demonstration of Psutka’s sensitivity to the details of composition—not as common today in the digital age as it was at a time when an album’s physical form implied a certain necessary cohesion.  is computer music rendered to soundtrack a modern technological dystopia, a cold sci-fi futurism that is no longer so chronologically nebulous. Egyptrixx recasts the terror and alienation that Philip K.

That Dream Wave earnestly covers Beat Happening’s “fourteen” is wonderfully on the nose. Kelton Young, a Nashville-based teenage singer, self-released   last year, and his child-like cover art sets the album’s apprehensive, nostalgic tone. At just under 20 minutes,   is full of emotionally open songs dealing with change and separation. On “she’s already moved on,” the album’s opener, Young pieces together memories of someone he’s left behind (“tried to memorize your face / so I don’t have to say goodbye”). According to the little context Young provides for the album, these songs were recorded prior to his leaving Nashville for college. The album’s introspective tone seems to signal the discomfort with newness that often accompanies a new life chapter. But it’s not all homesick gloom; the instrumental “feel better” has a cheerful country twang, and in “tell her how you feel,” Young audibly sniffles before almost breaking into a laugh. Taken in full,   perfectly captures the unease of an unfamiliar bed, the quiet longing for old friends, and the desire for home’s simple comforts.

The jagged-edged high-school notebook font of their logo isn’t the only thing the band borrows from Metallica’s  ; they’ve learned all the right lessons about playing as loud, as fast, and as recklessly as possible. Entries into their badass catalogue have been distributed via contemporary West Coast labels such as Thee Oh Sees frontman John Dwyer’s Castle Face and Orange County garage-pop powerhouse Burger Records. The band’s latest release is a two-song seven-inch on Famous Class, a Brooklyn label that has some notable singles by the likes of Ty Segall, Speedy Ortiz and Parquet Courts under its belt. Zig Zags’ four-horsemen-of-the-Apocalypse gallop on new 7-inch single “Ripping Death”/”Riddle of Steel” is an impressive double-sider of searing thrash. No matter how ambitious they get with their pull-offs and hammer-on riffs, there’s no escaping the truth that Zig Zags are a punk band at heart. The single’s A-side, “Ripping Death,” lives up to its B-grade VHS horror nomenclature. It’s straightforward and furious, and for all of its pomp and fiery fretwork showmanship, it could pass for vintage L.A. punk such as Black Flag or Fear with just a moderate shift in drum beats. The real treat of the pairing is the B-Side, “Riddle of Steel,” named for the central motif in  . Metal and fantasy have always been natural pairings, and while the camp factor here hits the ceiling, Zig Zags’ songwriting here is at its most rhythmically driving and heroically melodic, showcasing the breadth of their dynamics via a blend of acoustic and electric instruments, changes in tempo and a keep-on-fighting motivational speech via Jed Maheu’s lyrics: “What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger!” In a way, the band’s mastery of their sound is like the riddle of steel itself: The true strength is in the hand that wields it. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-zig-zags-ripping-death-bw-riddle-of-steel"}

Other tracks such as “I encrypt as much as I can” and the moving “s/as boy/as a boy” use phrases directly lifted from Manning’s online chats, illuminating her own personal identity battle: “I wouldn’t mind going to prison for the rest of my life if it wasn’t for the possibility of having pictures of me… plastered all over the world press… as a boy; the CPU is not made for this motherboard.” As a whole, the album is a pleasantly uncomfortable listen—challenging us to confront ideas of gender, war and music itself through dazzling fireworks of sound. This isn’t easy territory, but it was never meant to be. While he’s tagged his work as “electroacoustic,” “classical,” and “experimental,” Hearne has said that he chose Bandcamp as a platform partially for its flexible categorizations. “The most annoying thing for any artist is that these giant services force you to be in a genre category.

Highlighting tracks like “Perils of the Sea” and “Gilgamesh” are shot through with fantastical themes and spiraling lead guitar. Gone are the days where bands required gimmicks to sell their product.

On its surface,   seems to present more of the same. It’s got the same monochromatic cover art, the same compact songs, the same abbreviated running time.

How, exactly, do those components work together, especially within the conventions of improvised music? But Earth Tongues doesn’t just improvise in the standard terms; they’ve developed their own intuitive rule system and “language.” Texture, color, and interplay are usually the key components in freely-improvised music, but this slow-moving beast of a combo goes heavier and deeper than surface aesthetics. Together, they create harrowing environments where sounds emerge from silence—colliding, disintegrating, and wriggling in unexpected directions. The music hovers more than it moves, a lumbering, low-impact, largely unpitched din constructed of minimalist gestures, extended technique flurries, and multiple varieties of friction. The two-part work, clocking in at 94 minutes, requires a certain degree of patience, if not total submission. The effort is rewarded.   delivers a kind of immersive ambience that almost feels like a field recording. The album cover features a nighttime shot of a fallen branch and leaves nestled within moss-covered boulders, and the sounds contained here fill out that picture. Objects are rubbed, horns quietly blubber, pre-recorded sounds on cassettes are smeared into abstraction, and, once in awhile, a recognizable brassy tone coalesces. There are moments when the pieces glide into a more intentional sphere, with unhurried build-ups that produce sudden percussive rumbles, suggesting a Martin Denny soundtrack for the apocalypse. More often, though, the performances breathe patiently, murmuring like metallic cicadas, elongated bird calls, and distant wolf howls.

Though each record has one foot in hip-hop, Medline’s work is both 100 percent sample-free and mostly instrumental. His latest LP,  , is an expansive, slow-burn record that locates the sweet spot between ‘70s exploitation film soundtracks and French arthouse sex film music.

Using a portable microphone to capture found sounds and sample his surroundings, Löffler has woven the natural environment deep into the record’s fabric. He loops the sound of struck wood into shuffling percussion on “Lid” and juxtaposes field recordings with organic instruments, like the marimba and mandolin zither. Löffler lends his shy vocal to a number of tracks, notably a small reverie titled “Pacific.” But Monha of the Hamburg-based band Me Succeeds—who first collaborated with Löffler on his debut album, A Forest—returns for four tracks, and her halting refrains on “Wildnerness” and “Vind” count amongst Mare’s most plainly lovely moments.

Though a career in nightlife, like any other “creative” job, can be often a nauseating farce of self-congratulation, there are still times when the process leads to vibrant and inspired work. Case in point: London-based dance producer  , who started his career as a cut-and-paste renderer of archived blues, gospel, and soul. On his first three releases, Romare navigated stacks of these samples, embellishing them with deep, lurching beats to create moody, downtempo sounds. On November’s  , Romare’s second full-length, he expands both conceptually (“every nook and cranny of the romantic impulse,” reads the album’s copy) and compositionally, leaning less on borrowed music in favor of building tracks with an array of live instruments. One of Romare’s most common construction methods is to anchor melodies in pronounced vocal samples. On “All Night,” it’s a raspy blues wail that has the same immediacy as Moby circa  . On “Je T’aime” and “Come Close to Me,” the melodies have the same ebb and flow as a murmuring Four Tet track. On his previous efforts, Romare used vocal melodies to guide and inform the remaining rhythmic elements. On tracks like “Honey” and “New Love,” however, Romare uses vocals unpredictably, as a foil for the rhythms rather than a lead. This subtle compositional growth, and the songs that result, make  feel refreshingly expansive. Conceptually, Romare’s exploration of love yields a few different interpretations on the theme. On opener “Who To Love?”, he leaves things open-ended; on “Who Loves You?” he scratches at uncertainty, loneliness, and anxiety, fusing urgent bass thumps with sinister string layers. On “Come Close to Me,” an album standout and possibly Romare’s finest track to date, he offers an enveloping atmosphere of keyboards and swelling synth loops, equally seductive and elegant, as a way of conjuring the idea of intimacy. More often than not,   strikes bass-charged electronic dance gold.   is an endearing and rewarding milestone on Romare’s journey as an artist, bringing theme and composition into harmony. If we must abide another DJ-turned-producer (and we must), a bid of good faith to Romare feels safe.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/romare-love-songs-part-two-review"}

No singer personifies that region quite like Terry Allen.  Allen carries the dust of West Texas in his throat, with a voice like a coyote’s yip and a twang like wind-thrummed barbed wire. There’s a quiet desperation and depression found in the people that populate that part of Texas, but the genius of Allen’s songwriting is the way he drills below the surface to find the black humor hidden underneath. That skill is on display throughout his 1978 double album  , which is here given the deluxe reissue treatment by Paradise of Bachelors. Imagine Bob Dylan recording   down in Lubbock with a crack roadhouse band (led by producer/ steel virtuoso Lloyd Maines), or fellow Lubbockian Joe Ely cutting   and you have an idea of Allen’s irascible sound and vision. Allen’s album is populated with all manner of country kooks: good-hearted, gold-teethed women (“The Girl Who Danced Oklahoma”), craven art collectors [“The Collector (and the Art Mob)”], a star-crossed high school football player [“The Great Joe Bob (A Regional Tragedy)”], and Wolfman Jack, growling on the AM radio.

She informs the listener that she’s done dealing with the constraints men put on her: “I can be pretty/I can be carefree/I can be anything I want to be/I don’t care what you think about me.” As Carlier breathes the final words of the song “Trash Tongue,” everything pulls back so that we can hear each instrument in relief: the grueling basslines from Tristan Bardré, the fabulously sludgy rock guitar work of Victoria Arfi, and Gaïlla Montanier’s anchored drumming. In the song’s last gasp, feedback enters and the track cuts out abruptly. Mary Bell is a feminist punk band that’s part of a Parisian scene currently being pulled in radically different directions.

{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0012426418_2.jpg", "album": "Soundscapes for the Emotional​-​Type Listener", "artist": "Slow Attack Ensemble", "description": "You’d think ambient music would be the last style ever to break the fourth wall. Ambient, after all, is about dissolving into the moment, about being enveloped by pure atmosphere. Occasionally, an artist will nudge and wink at the self-seriousness of the whole phenomenon, even as they indulge in its vaporous fullness. That was certainly  ’s approach, beginning with the self-referential (and mildly self-deprecating) title of 2001’s  ; on 2007’s  , as they sunk even more deeply into gauzily narcotic arrangements for guitars, strings, and endless reverb, their titles catapulted into the full-on absurd: “Another Ballad for Heavy Lids,” “The Mouthchew,” “December Hunting for Vegetarian Fuckface.” Slow Attack Ensemble’s  —the work of a Canadian musician named Chuck Blazevic—bears a similar tongue-in-cheek approach. Perhaps not coincidentally, Blazevic’s earlier work under the   alias sounded quite a bit like Stars of the Lid.   purported to capture “the elegiac dimensions” of American popular music in the years between ’50s and ’60s rock, though in practice, that goal mostly translates to endless echo and fathomless yearning. (If you’ve heard any of those songs that have been slowed 800 percent that have made their way around the internet, Dreamsploitation also sounds a lot like those.) His new album also tackles a specific style and a specific era, but this time, it actually sounds like its subject. In an email, Blazevic told me that the album is “heavily inspired by the more minimal and organic elements of 1980s Japanese and Mediterranean ambient-electronic music.” Mixing piano, electric guitar, synthesizer, and copious amounts of reverb, the album could easily be mistaken for the real thing. Like the best ambient music, it fades unobtrusively into the background, but there’s just enough there to hold your attention, if you should feel so inclined—what Brian Eno meant when he said that ambient music should be “as ignorable as it is interesting.” Though it’s just 23 minutes long, the album covers an ambitious amount of ground without ever losing focus. The opening “November, 1st in Detroit” nicely captures the album’s simple-but-complex qualities by setting a handful of elements—string plucks, airy synthesizer pads, the slightest hint of marimba—in lazy circulation, drifting in and out of phase like tape loops running in parallel. The shifting pulses are reminiscent of the tide lapping against boats in the harbor, and a fluid bass solo offers the album’s most melodic moment. On “Mizue,” there’s a hint of Harold Budd in the watery piano, while “Elegy for Elodie” takes a more hypnotic approach, running simple piano patterns through multiple delays until their movements resemble the rings left by raindrops in a pond. The album’s second half is more electronic, with quiet synthesizer melodies framed in gentle ambience. An echo of Cocteau Twins’ pristine guitar tone ripples through “After Images,” and the sound of rushing water accompanies the optimistic tones of the closing “Landscape of Perpetual Oblivion.” The most tantalizing of all, though, is the penultimate track, “Bells”—a 43-second sketch of synthesizer that transports you to the snowy courtyard of an ancient temple in a small, distant village. There’s no breaking the fourth wall here; as brief as it may be, the illusion is total. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/slow-attack-ensemble-soundscapes-for-the-emotional-type-listener-review"}

Yet despite some superficial links—they’re on Cosloy’s 12XU label, share a producer with   and  , and their guitarist sometimes drums for  —this scorched-earth post-punk outfit bears very little resemblance to the average Nuggets-tripping, 6th Street-roaming garage group.

This is the Gospel Truth’s second full-length album, following 2013’s  , and it increases the flow of chaotic, unhinged energy through tightly constructed rhythms. “Jealous Fires,” the opening track, is also the album’s best, with its rusty-knife guitar slashes and frenetic stabs of rapid bass. Patrick Travis wreaks terse chaos with six strings, bassist David Petro counterpunches violently from below, and drummer Brandon Crowe holds the whole thing in shape with crisp, dry rhythms. Mechanically precise—but also highly flammable—the cut clanks, jitters, and abrades, full of abrupt millisecond stops and starts, the kind that startle like jolts of electricity. Over this racket, singer Mike Tonucci moans and howls, his voice shrouded in spooky reverb; he sounds a bit like Jim Morrison fronting Fire Engines. None of the album’s other tracks quite reach this apex, though the austere, staccato “Heaven Is Ugly” ratchets up the skeletal tension and “32” piles on a feverish, enraged jangle,   the Nightingales. The album swerves briefly into the conventional with “You Don’t Want Us” and “Hunger Artist,” a pair of sludgy blues-rockers.

Ambient maestro Tim Hecker turns in a highly detailed mix that hones in on each of the many manic mallet strikes, and spins them around to create broadened soundscape. The remix by Fennesz introduces some of his dreamy, disruptive digital fizz, while Oneohtrix Point Never adds elements of piano, strings, and insectoid electronics. The stylistic range is more varied than might be expected, from rhythmic noise (via Greg Saunier, drummer of the art-prog band Deerhoof) to delay-effect fantasias (Ian Williams of Battles) to an appealingly inappropriate piece featuring acoustic guitar (the rarely-not-eccentric Squarepusher).

One night, while touring Greece with soul ensemble Lee Fields and the Expressions, keyboardist Toby Pazner was visited in his sleep by a toga-clad, curly-haired gentleman who told him to return to New York and build a “Temple of Sound” to honor the music of Ancient Greece. After the dream persisted night after night, Pazner gave in. When he got home, he began amassing a collection of top-notch gear and a who’s-who of NYC soul session players—not terribly hard for a key member of the Daptone universe—and began constructing his homage. While certain logistical obstacles make it difficult to verify Pazner’s dream, the group’s origin myth is rendered moot by the radiance and gravity of their fully instrumental debut album. Many of the Olympians play in groups held together by a powerful human voice—they’ve backed Fields, Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley—and part of the thrill here is seeing how they adapt to that lack of an easy focal point. In the process, they’ve built a series of highly-nuanced arrangements that remain engaging even as they hypnotize, and listening to the Olympians feels akin to floating on a salty sea. While these songs all feature booming horns, it’s the addition of more subtle instruments, like bells, harp, vibes and a smattering of guitar, that give each song (all of which are named after a planet or an element of Greek mythology, natch) distinct personalities and character. “Mars” features a harp and bass combination that evokes a mellower version of Flying Lotus’ “Drips/Auntie’s Harp,” while “Mercury’s Odyssey” is a more up-tempo jaunt bound together by a thicket of guitars and keys. And even though we never hear a human voice, the album sneaks in a handful of terrific solos, from the flute on opening track “Sirens of Jupiter” to the stately trumpet on “Venus,” to serve a similar role. While the Olympians may have originally taken shape halfway around the world, their debut—held together by an overflowing well of virtuosic talent—hits home. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/olympians-daptone-review"}

Posway sings on “Whitedwarf/Late October.” Two songs later, on “Deathscene/Half Decade,” the situation has worsened. “Slipping too far into that dreaded mood,” Posway sings. “Before you knew it, you gave up on a half decade of dating.” Those sentiments are a good indication of what to expect on   a record shot through with angst and existential despair. On “Our Last Game Of Chess,” Posway grapples with the realization that early life decisions—”before we’re given the privilege to determine who we are”—determine future directions, while the protagonist of “Kneel To See Me” is overwhelmed that his own depression caused an ex pain, despairing that he’s still “getting no sleep, still living transient by design.” The arrangements are spacious and wistful, with spare, structural drumming and occasional flashes of color, such as trumpet or violin. “Kneel To See Me” is a hushed acoustic elegy with faded piano, its melancholy curlicues of guitar nodding toward ’90s indie and emo; the ramshackle “Sermon,” with its brisk, tumbling rhythms, has all the sprightliness of vintage jangle-pop. For all its anxiety,  remains driving and buoyant. Guest vocalist Jianna Justice adds lilting melodies and backing harmonies throughout (most notably on the Lemuria-esque “Sick Spine”), which mesh perfectly with Posway’s proudly vulnerable voice. And then there’s the playfully self-loathing “Voice Memo,” which lives up to its title. Posway cedes vocal responsibilities to guitarist Evan Tyor, who sounds like he’s singing directly into a phone. Faint keyboards hum in the background as Tyor quietly murmurs, “Everybody hates me/ Super lonely/ Super duper, duper lonely.” When he gets to the end of the line, his voice cracks with laughter. It’s a welcome moment of levity, revealing that, beneath all of their sorrow, Scooterbabe’s sense of humor remains intact. It’s a reminder that joy is possible, and that pain is temporary. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/scooterbabe-the-sorrow-youve-been-toting-around-review"}

But the Minnesota group Posh Lost have found a way to split the difference. Their self-titled debut, released via the venerable Mirror Universe Tapes, is a case study in how to mope majestically. Their lineup allows them something of a cheat code: bassist Jack Woolsey’s low, desolate voice is perfect for the brooders; Guitarist Jeff Cornell’s gently-pleading tenor ideal for the anthems. The result is a record whose 10 songs are as bleak and mossy as an 18th Century cemetery, but have a nerviness and intensity that prevents them from feeling waterlogged. “Fabricate,” is the perfect example: the guitars prick and poke like bat talons, but Woolsey’s dark-prophet vocal style gives its three-word chorus (“She’s not eating”) a chilling ominousness. On “Sense of Self,” Cornell’s voice pulls the melody gracefully upward, the band floating like funeral mist far below. But more than that, Posh Lost know mood is nothing without the songs to back it up, and they have both; “Portraits” is a heartsick ballad that recalls Joy Division’s “Atmosphere,” suffused with soft blue synths and skeletal guitar; it could have been a tossed-off snoozer, but Woolsey’s simple, four-note melody makes it feel instant and indelible. “Impulse” clatters and rattles, erupting triumphantly at the chorus like a submerged magician finally wriggling free of the straitjacket. Posh Lost seem to be subconsciously following Bruce Cockburn’s old dictum about kicking the darkness until it bleeds daylight. Their debut offers a welcome, hefty helping of both.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/posh-lost-mirror-universe-review"}

Enter John Mills-Cockell, a Toronto-born synth explorer blessed by contact with the electronic avant-garde early in his teens, and his cohorts: the freeform saxophonist Doug Pringle and mystic/percussionist Alan Wells. The trio emerged piecemeal and coincidentally: cross-Canadian train trips, visits from the good doctor Timothy Leary, work with Cream producer Felix Pappalardi, interdisciplinary coffeehouse happenings. And yet, a peaceful, studied stillness emanates from the spare output of their group, Syrinx. The   label collects both of the group’s albums and a smattering of live recordings and other ephemera on  : a sumptuous feast for curious listeners. In the handful of non-album material we find the group’s one claim to fame: the song “Tillicum”, commissioned by the CTV television network as the theme for a  -esque current affairs program called “Here Come The Seventies.” “Tillicum” is a pithy introduction to Syrinx’s ambitious music; bookended by coast-to-coast washes of oscillating waves, the song races on a track of vaguely robotic, bubbling rhythm, with Pringle’s sax calling Reveille over top. You can easily imagine the accompanying bustling montage of industrious Canadian life, ushering in the churn of a new decade. The single charted briefly (an instrumental made up of keyboard noise, drum machine, sax and no vocals!) and there’s probably Canadians of a certain age still humming it to this day. Plunging into the rest of Syrinx’s discography, one finds far more pastoral pleasures. RVNG has seen fit to sequence the group’s second album first; it’s the lone album they recorded outright as a unit and the most powerful evidence of their power as a band. “Long Lost Relatives” finds the group already in flight from the start, with Pringle’s ochre-hued sax introducing the proceedings on “Tumblers,” before Mills-Cockell’s curlicues of synth tangle with Wells’ charging bongos. “Syren” runs Pringle’s sax through a synthesizer, encrusting it with a bit of jurassic might recalling “Lark’s Tongues”-era Crimson, before “December Angel” provides one of the set’s high points. After a cacophonous minute of scrapes, clangs and insect-like wails, Mills-Cockell’s Moog keys appear, Verne-like, far beneath the Earth’s surface. Slowly, the strings of a borrowed orchestra emerge, as cascading plucks, bells and gongs melt together in a tectonic fluid, thrumming and huge, buoyed slowly back to the surface by bubbles of Arp and sax, and the call of some synthetic seagull. It’s a breathtaking piece, and it’s hard to say just what it is. Jazz, classical, prog rock, new age? It’s not altogether clear if the members themselves knew. The songs that close disc one come from the group’s 1970 debut, and contain the most delicate Syrinx output, culled from Mills-Cockell’s solo sessions on organ and synth, with Pringle and Wells later adding sax and hand drum overdubs. These uphold the RVNG reissue ethos of rescuing lost relaxation music. “Chant for Your Dragon King” is a stately processional with an overwhelming sense of wistfulness, like Mike Ratledge playing a funeral march in 14th century Wallachia. ‘Appaloosa-Pegasus’ channels Riley, hitching buzzing synth to Wells’ galloping tabla, while ‘Hollywood Dream Trip’ evokes the woozy, implacable bliss-state of  .

But it’s on the second track, “Acrylic,” where Robinson’s spatial acuity becomes clear. The song is full of programmed percussion and melodic synthesizer lines, but they all occupy their own space, arranged with a seeming aversion to density. Cramming that much sound into a song could be dizzying, but Robinson’s clean sense of sound-design steers clear of clutter, arriving instead at a sort of breezy busyness. “Sizzle” follows, operating in a slower mode, making for ideal wind-down dance music. Juniper returns on “Breathing,” her voice coupled with  the kind of pointillist sounds and piano riffs that wouldn’t sound out of place on a composition by Philip Glass. The devotion to variety continues as  expands, journeying through swells of day-glo bass music (“We’ve Been”) and stately lounge (“Shuffle Home”). Juniper reappears to sing in three more songs, but Robinson’s tracks, with their rubbery percussive feel and eloquently specific drum sounds, talk well on their own terms—in a language guided by atmosphere and rhythm more than words. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/frederic-robinson-flea-waltz-review"}

They come with a lengthy list of musical credentials: vocalist Phil Swanson once sang with Atlantean Kodex and Hour of 13 (among countless others), and producer/guitarist Arthur Rizk has manned the boards for Inquisition, Power Trip, and Pissgrave. That expertise shows: Sumerlands’ songs are full of triumphant, reverb-drenched vocal work, and are powered by riffs that are as catchy and infectious as they are clean, solid, and directional. Rizk’s solos are melodic and technical, and their unconventional placement—like the one in the closing moments of “The Guardian”—only serve to highlight his skill. Justin De Tore’s drumming is full of perfected accents, driving rhythms, and galloping fills, riding lockstep with Rizk’s leads. Tracks like “Haunted Forever” and “Timelash” follow the playbook for epic, heavy metal anthems: riffs awash in distortion, metronome-perfect drums and exultant singing. Sumerlands’ self-titled debut on   feels like heavy metal circa 1986 in the best possible way. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/sumerlands-debut-review"}

The 17-minute collection boasts the group’s catchiest hooks to date, from the New-Wave pop riff that kicks off opening track “Cool 2” to the dramatic, Fleetwood Mac-inspired sonic buildup on “Gemini,” which closes the five-song EP. “So here I go, back into my same old malaise,” Auscherman sings on “Cool 2.” It could be the EP’s defining statement; with vocals buried in the mix, Auscherman, Krauter and Beresford sing about restless confusion and the tragicomic passing of time—subjects that contrast with the group’s propensity for relaxed melodies and inviting power-pop riffs.

It was on one of these 45s that  debuted, with their moving interpretation of the southern soul classic, “I’d Rather Go Blind,” popularized by Etta James. While their full-length debut,   also features two covers—this time from the Daptone catalog—its strength is in its nine originals. “Purple” is quietly infectious, with Dan Klein’s sweet, gentle voice relying more on sincerity than acrobatics. The album’s general mood is one of sun-splashed joy, even when the lyrics deal with heartbreak, as they do on “All My Tears.” The melancholy  “Till Then” is underscored by guitarist Preet Patel’s brief, yearning solo, which gets a prologue from his brother Chuck with a few strokes on the keyboard ( ). Rich Terrana’s drums on the track are almost a ghostly presence, felt more than heard, but they’re a vital element to the record’s swinging pace. For all its splendor, the record is colored by tragedy; Klein was diagnosed with ALS, and passed away in June, just before the record’s release.

There have always been many facets to his game—and his wide-ranging explorations have been marked by a deep understanding of every disparate tradition. On his staggering new album   he takes on the jagged cadences of Senegalese rap and the murky atmospherics of underground hip-hop with a powerful live band that breathlessly translates electronic production ideas and MPC-derived beats in real-time to mostly acoustic instruments. Jazz and hip-hop have been flatmates for decades, but more often than not, fusions of the two have forced one of the ingredients to be watered down: not so with  Anti-Pop Consortium MC HPrizm and Dakar’s Gaston Bandimic, who raps in Wolof, slalom through the complex, stuttering shape-shifting grooves and clipped melodic shards shaped by altoist Lehman and French soprano saxophonist Maciek Lasserre. The horn men blow astringently precise passages that toggle between tightly coiled unison and lockstep counterpoint; their propulsive improvisations are as forceful as the words spit by the rappers. Drummer Damion Reid unleashes an epic performance, dropping heavy beats that constantly change direction, feel, and time signature from bar-to-bar, presenting himself as a human drum machine with a mind of its own—a sound he’s been perfecting since his contributions to the paradigm-shifting 2007 Robert Glasper album  . Double bassist Drew Gress anchors the splintered grooves while keyboardist Carlos Homs alternates between evocative textures, spooky harmony, and stabbing accents.

Both have texture, tone, and tests of patience that promise certain rewards. But the making of each—one usually by means of electronic processing, and the other most often by hand—signals different origins and different priorities. For the cross-genre collaboration  , two artists—the Mexican ambient producer Murcof and French classical pianist Vanessa Wagner—focused on matters of contrast and commonality to find a meaningful middle ground. The duo came together under the aegis of InFiné, a French label with curious ears (the company motto: “easy music for the hard to please”), and settled on a cast of celebrated modern and contemporary composers to both of their liking. The result is a sort of crash-course in 20th-century classical music remade in ways that celebrate the source. John Cage comes first with “In a Landscape,” which starts off as a naturalistic solo piano piece before certain notes begin to echo and stretch in ways that suggest more than just ebony and ivory at play. That would be Murcof, working with electronic effects that gradually become more and more pronounced, until it becomes hard to distinguish what is acoustic and what is electric. Giving up that ghost comes as welcome relief as   stretches out stylistically. In “Variations for the Healing of Arinushka,” beatific piano notes divined by Arvo Pärt are greeted delicately by an electronic throb and even beats by the end. In “Avril 14th,” the tables are turned with a track by electronic antagonist Aphex Twin (from his infamous album  ) turned into something more conservatory-inclined, thanks to Wagner’s tender performance. Points of approach vary, so that György Ligeti gets a treatment as dark, moody noise (“Musica Ricercata No. 2”) and Morton Feldman turns to minimal techno murmured in hushed tones (“Piano Piece 1952”). All the while, Murcof and Wagner rise up and down in terms of prominence with a deft sense of when each is needed—and when both can come together as one. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/murcof-x-vanessa-wagner-statea-review"}

Vocalist Anthony Cozzi was way, way, way down in the mix, with deference given to foamy washes of guitar. It was a durable, impressive entry into the constantly-growing catalog of post-’10s psych rock. But it was in no way a prelude to follow-up  , on which the band shakes off the THC malaise, turns off the lights and commences a chilling Saint Vitus Dance. Cozzi is bellowing now, terrified and terrifying, and opener “Dreaming of Giants” comes on like a sudden chill in an empty house—a tip-off that something supernatural has entered the room. Over the course of the album’s 10 songs, Radar Eyes combine the fanged severity of death rock with a newfound sense of tunefulness and dynamics. “Giants” works its way up to a cataclysmic chorus, chords crashing and banging like glassware hitting concrete. “Between Two Worlds” is more reserved, its loosely-knitted guitars recalling the early days of R.E.M., when they were still siphoning the darkness from the American south and turning it into song. What strikes most about the record is the band’s drive and force—all of the songs seem propelled by a sense of sweaty-palmed desperation. “Hungry Ghost” claws its way forward, Cozzi wailing like a freaked-out undertaker over the taut wire guitars. The album’s true showstopper is “A Daughter’s Hymn,” on which Cozzi duets with Angela Mullenhour of  . Over a funereal synth line, the pair spin the kind of tale that wouldn’t be out of place in a   story, full of black nights and sinister creatures. It helps that Mullenhour’s approximation of Siouxsie Sioux—in tone, accent, delivery and nuance—is so dead-on anyone without the album credits on hand might wonder how the band netted such a marquee guest star. But like all of  , the song transcends mere homage to become something stark and chilling in its own right. The album’s overriding mood may be despair, but rarely has a band sounded so energized reveling in it. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/radar-eyes-radiant-remains-review"}

Throughout his career, Collins has used absurdity as a foil for sincere sentiment, and   is no exception; even when it veers towards the whimsical, it can’t help but radiate joy. Collins, who used to travel the country by freight train, wrote and recorded   in an extensive list of cities—from Los Angeles to Baltimore; Vancouver to Rockaway Beach, New York City—with an equally lengthy list of collaborators. As a result, the album plays like a blurry, delightful travelogue, capturing Collins’ rambling odyssey from coast to coast. While he’s certainly the project’s ringleader, more often than not it’s his pals who take center stage. Collaborators like Ariel Pink, Weyes Blood’s Natalie Mering (who steals the show on both the album’s title track and the halting lead single “Suddenly”) and Sheer Agony’s Jackson MacIntosh raise their voices more than Collins himself.  maintains the palette of his past work, but this time around, Michael Collins has honed in on the age-old maxim that we’re only as good as the company we keep. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/drugdealer-review"}

And while the uninitiated might be tempted to accuse the pair of gross sentimentality, those familiar with their respective solo albums won’t be surprised to hear that the love presented on this record is a farce. Having already released a slew of highlights within the vaporwave genre, waterfront dining is no stranger to music depicting modern existence as a wishful simulation. Neither is 蜃気楼MIRAGE, who despite being active for only a couple of years, has been responsible for a wide array of records under such aliases as  ,   and  .

While  undoubtedly offers a break from such a loose framework, it too encourages a similar detachment from the body. Tracks like the volatile “MITOCHONDRIA” and the jittery “CELLDIVISION” sport inhospitable rhythms and atomic melodies, defying the listener to follow along with anything other than mute amazement.

Recording under the name   (pronounced “mind design”), his personality seems to disappear completely into his music, drifting through space on some distant astral plane. So the concept behind Ancheta’s new album,  , comes as little surprise: It’s about a homeless man who meets a mysterious woman, who gives him shelter and instructs him to bathe with a body wash that transports him to an alternate dimension. Sonically,  is a 16-track synth-funk album that bears a strong kinship with the work of singer/rapper Anderson .Paak. Both artists pull from ’80s R&B, tweaking it slightly so it connects with modern-day listeners. Ancheta took his artist name from a lyric on Nas’s 1996 song “Affirmative Action” (“My mind is seeing through ya design like blind fury…”), and grew up on a commune, the child of a Filipino revolutionary and Ivy League neuroscientist. That experience opened his eyes to a wide variety of both sonic and social perspectives, giving him the kind of nuanced viewpoint necessary to create music that’s both familiar and esoteric. Even when it’s conjuring visions of an early ‘80s roller rink,   feels distinct. Songs like “Cosmic Perspective” and “Alluptoyou” have the kind of shark-skin suit/champagne soul upon which Death Row Records built a rap empire in the mid ‘90s, as well as the “Computer Blue”-era techno-soul that Andre 3000 mined to great benefit on 2003’s  . Vocally, Archeta isn’t as polished: On “Alluptoyou,” in particular, his vocals are run through a heavy electronic filter, giving them an almost robotic quality. “Ya Own Way,” “Transmissionnn,” and “Lather” are exuberant homages; all three tracks open with crystallized breaks, a la Zapp and Roger Troutman’s 1986 classic “Computer Love.” Simmering keytars and noodling synthesizers run up and down the scales, and the entire song builds to a euphoric end. But even if you’re not aware of the album’s nostalgic reference points,   is still fresh and exciting, built on a sensual, transformative sounds. “Searchin’” is the album’s true home-run; the song is billed as a three-act play (“4 That Familiar Feelin’,” “4 Sumthin’ New,” “4 Nothin Else”), demonstrating the wide scope of Archeta’s artistic vision. Closing out with toe-tapping melodic G-funk, these are ambitious tracks that ultimately hit the mark. On  , Archeta drifts deep into the crates, returning with something resonant and ambitious. He aims for the stars, doing his best to transcend his art and personal existence, making a joyous LP.

The coastal artist community is still full of self-governed loners nearly 25 years later, but that doesn’t mean their way of life hasn’t felt threatened by climate change and the Bay Area’s status as a playground for the New Wolves of Wall Street. Or as a   once put it—and this was  —“Welcome to Bolinas; Please Keep On Moving.” That story opened with water district president Vic Amoroso pushing back against the village’s popularity with “belligerent young males” by insisting “there is no reason to come to Bolinas.

HKE has said that he and 2814 co-conspirator  aimed to write an album about, “a sacred place away from our current reality… a reality we can’t perceive with our limited senses.” Listening to the glowing, rippling electronics on “Transference” and “Contact,” it’s not hard to imagine that place.

True to form, Kelly recorded, mixed and played every instrument on the new  , but this time, his artistic solitude wasn’t borne of aesthetics but geography—specifically, Kelly’s recent move to the Irish coastal town of Spiddal:  . Kelly addresses the isolating nature of his new residence on the album’s opening track, “What Makes A Man Start Gorse Fires?”: “Three months in, still getting looks from strangers/ Constant danger in the queue for cans.” That experience of feeling out of phase (and finding it difficult to connect with the people who matter most) permeates most of  . “Disengagement” speaks to Kelly’s tenuous faith in the mysterious, whether it’s practicing religion, or time-worn work rituals; On “Wait It Out,” he expresses paranoia over Big Brother-level invasions of privacy; and on “Something More” and “Batman, Tonight,” he grapples with paralyzing romantic fear. Kelly’s unsentimental vocals add a matter-of-fact tone to his songs; he’s torn up about them, but resigned to their presence in his life. Musically, however,   was clearly emboldened by his experiences working with a full band.

Unraveling guitars with an off-kilter sense of balance give “At Home” a ’90s throwback feel, while the fuzzy, proto-metal guitar solo on “No Trades” is a sly wink to the song’s lyrical namechecking of Thin Lizzy. Kelly’s gift for taut arrangements means  ’s messier moments— a distorted, comet-tail guitar solo on “Asleep On A Bus,” the deconstructed jazz interlude near the end of “Westerly Direction”—never derail or undermine the songs.

With his old group, the NYC-based octet Phenomenal Handclap Band, he created colorful songs by weaving together strands of disco, pop, and psych-rock. Yet for all the mesmerizing, polyrhythmic grooves they conjured, their two albums remained somewhat cautious (and occasionally a bit toothless). But with Drakkar Nowhere, Collás’ new project with fellow PHB member Morgan Phalen, the duo pushes themselves out of their comfort zone, putting their trust in both rich vocal melodies and finely-textured arrangements. Written largely in a rented house in Stockholm, Sweden, with a gaggle of local musicians including members of rock bands Dungen and the Amazing, Drakkar Nowhere is Collás and Phalen’s strongest, and most eccentric, work to date. While PHB grounded itself in the music of the ‘80s, Drakkar Nowhere finds its reference points in early psychedelic rock. The album opens with “Any Way,” where sweet piano and crystalline vocal lines are a delightful dead ringer for the Zombies’ “This Will be Our Year,” before things move into headier territory. True to its name, “Higher Now” delivers a barrage of intergalactic synths over a hypnotic, deep bass loop, and “Did It Ever?” boasts an unironic flute in the vein of Jethro Tull’s “Aqualung.” While the expansive and mostly-instrumental closing track “Salutation to the Sun” drifts a bit into  Stonehenge” territory with its drum freakout and Gregorian monk vocals, it maintains an elegance that overrides any whimsical or parodic read. Throughout their debut as Drakkar Nowhere, Collás and Phalen haven’t abandoned their affinity for musical hodge-podge as much as they’ve tackled it, demonstrating a newfound, and bold, sense of adventure. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/drakkar-nowhere-self-titled-review"}

The Afghan singer and dombra player named Ismail—who’d been shot and burned by the Taliban for playing his percussive instrument—turns in an impassioned performance. And Abdullah Kathim, a 21-year-old member of the “stateless” Bedoon ethnic minority in Kuwait, sings a meter-less solo “mawwal” improvisation about his betrayal by a friend. “This eve,” Abdullah sings in Arabic, “I want to bewail [my fate] and tell you of my sorrows.” Members of an Eritrean and Ethiopian group, along with UK group Get Gospel, sing happier notes—including the self-evidently optimistic “Yesus” and “Halleluyah.” Romanian folk-fiddle virtuoso Bogdan Vacarescu contributes a Balkan fiddle tune.

But the good ones do both. The solo debut by  , the London producer and label head best known for the work he releases under the name Funkineven, has a deliberately unpolished production style that’s a tonic in the face of mid ’10s dance music’s chronic maximalism. These tracks, heavy on vintage analog synthesizers, put the emphasis on Julien’s tunes, and the best stuff has real meat on its bones. “Kingdom” throws back to prime Chicago acid house, while “XL” is a boom-SNAP house track hooked on an off-kilter piano loop and a vocal snatch of the Jimmy Castor Bunch’s sample staple “It’s Just Begun.” (Julien ends it with what sounds like an early, drum-less demo of the track, a neat reversal of dance music’s usual build-to-a-peak style.) And “Disciple” crosses jazz-fusion bass with a driving breakbeat and buzzing analog synth, like circa-2000 broken-beat minus the smarm.

The California-based experimental metal duo of Ignat Frege and Felix Skinner have been expanding genre limitations for a half-decade, adding elements of IDM, trap, and industrial into their carefully-wrought compositions. On their latest, they slow things down, mastering a control over the juxtaposition of loud/quiet dynamics that gives full clarity to the anxiety and torment expressed in their songs in lyrics like, “I will lie supine, a trough of disappointment.”  Throughout  , the band’s particular vision of desolation operates on an expansive scale. The album opens with the volatile track “Powders,” which is centered around Skinner’s desperate, pleading vocals. The song builds slowly, eventually becoming an explosive call-and-response tale of a dissolving relationship, setting the tone for the album early by destroying any notion of calm or stability.  The remaining nine songs expand on that theme, deepening the sense of quiet unease. “Liver,” builds tension and dread over five minutes, focusing on atmosphere rather than onslaught. That restraint makes the moments where the songs do ignite feel all the more powerful: “Languish” opens with Skinner’s guttural cry, “Is this the sensible world or just a sick joke,” as the music escalates to a cacophony of screaming violins and thunderous drumming. “I tried to feel so alive that I couldn’t feel alive anymore,” he laments. It comes off like a last ditch effort to feel something—even if that something is pain.   Their experimentation with different genres, and shifting between any two of them on a dime, adds to the album’s turbulent nature. This disorienting, at times chaotic framework, accentuates the album’s themes of overwhelming shame, confusion, and regret.

Now another 1994 recording comes to light:  , Richard D. James’ playful collaboration with Planet Mu founder Mike Paradinas, aka µ-Ziq. Originally released on James’ Rephlex label in 1996, the album has been out of print for years, but Planet Mu is giving it the extensive reissue treatment, adding seven previously unreleased cuts to round out a double-CD or triple-LP package; all tracks have been remastered from the original DATs. Anyone who still believes that electronic music takes itself too seriously has probably never encountered this particular album, the cover of which is designed to resemble the   for the classic Milton Bradley game Downfall; they even tweaked the MB Games logo to say “MR Games,” short for the duo’s one-off alias, Mike & Rich. The music follows suit: Recorded over three days and nights in James’ flat, the album often finds the two at their zaniest, indulging a yen for wonky disco, spy-movie music, and other kitschy hallmarks of the easy-listening revival of the mid ’90s. “Reg” pairs swinging ’60s backbeats with marimba and whistling; “Mr. Frosty” evokes a lonely student disco with fist-mashed keys and an icy, dissonant sheen. It can be pretty puerile, even for James—the squelchy “Upright Kangaroo” is punctuated by actual belches—and it definitely ranks as a minor work in both artists’ respective catalogs. Still, it’s a worthy historic curio: For one thing, it marks one of the few occasions James has ever recorded with another artist. (Prior to his sessions with Paradinas, James had tried making music with Luke Vibert and a few other like-minded souls, but none of those tracks ever saw the light of day. Still, the sessions with Paradinas sound intense, and not only because they spent much of them drunk: “It was strange, the way we worked,” Paradinas told  when the album was first released. “We didn’t talk a lot. We didn’t talk at all, in fact.”) The best songs still sound exceptionally strange, even today; time has not tempered their weirdness. “Eggy Toast” is a woozy, brooding meditation in 7/4 time, the scabrous “Vodka” captures the duo’s noisiest impulses in full flower, and “The Sound of the Beady Eyes”—the title came to them while tripping on acid—is a meandering, brain-melting organ showcase that might be the closest either of these two ever got to jam-band territory. Better yet, this might be the rare occasion where the bonus material actually eclipses some of the original cuts: “Waltz,” in particular, unfurls a strangely moving chord progression as it notches up the distortion and delay—it’s as expressive as it is exploratory, in the finest Rephlex tradition. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/review-mike-and-rich-expert-knob-twiddlers"}

On “Rooftop,” Rakei describes the sensation of a first kiss in blushingly intimate terms. Throughout, his voice is quietly insistent, luxuriating naturally within the groove; but he’s just as effective when he picks up the pace. “Talk to Me” combines strummed guitar with Latin jazz rhythms, and on “Toko,” Rakei sings, “Time flies inside of me” over a splintering hard-bop beat.

The suffering he’s gone through seems to have paid off—it’s one of his most focused and rewarding records in years. Dating isn’t the only new thing Barnes is trying out. Though songs like “gratuitous abscesses” draw on typical of Montreal inspirations, like ‘60s pop, much of the music here is breaks new ground. Barnes listened to electronic producers like Jack U and Arca while writing these songs, and electro-pop opener “let’s relate” and the EDM-inspired “trashed exs” reveal the effects of those explorations. It’s not hard to imagine either tracks strategically placed in an underground DJ set. Like all of Barnes work, the real meat of this album is its confessional, unflinching subject matter. On “def pacts,” the effect is devastating: “It’s so tedious watching someone you care about keep failing themselves,” he sings, presumably about an emotionally unstable past lover. It’s one of the album’s most sonically interesting songs, a five-minute suite that alternates between minimal percussion, funky bass, and misty, near-whispered vocals nestled in swaying psychedelic pop. In a way, Barnes is the indiepop Kanye West: his lyrics mercilessly expose his self-hatred and his tendency to judge others. It’s what makes him endlessly fascinating as an artist, two decades into his career. “To survive in this world, you don’t have to become a parasite, you don’t have to be so mercenary, so cruel,” he sings on “def pacts.” Then he admits, “I’m just now learning this myself.” —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/of-montreal-innnocence-reaches-review"}

So while Bert Jansch’s classic 1985 album  may not have an array of bells and whistles, its songs are full of great, small moments. The album’s 15 tracks tackle a range of themes, running from relationships to political fare, like “Shout.” Jansch performs most of them using only his trademark guitar style, with its unusual chord voicing and added notes, and his voice (album-opener “Sweet Rose” swaps in a banjo, bridging the gap between his native Scotland and the Americana he invokes). His Glaswegian accent gives his music a shade of distinction. On “Time is an Old Friend,” his skipping cadence adds emphasis to his elegant and poignant lyrics: “Living and recounting love long ago/ Is a quiet and lonely, tickets only/ One-man drowning show,” he sings. But Jansch’s words and voice aren’t his only strength. The title track is an instrumental with a melody similar to “The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face,” which appeared on Jansch’s famous 1966 album  . Using guitar alone, Jansch plugs along as if slowly winding his way down a country path. His style is as definitive as it is original: both Eric Clapton and Neil Young have cited him as an influence.

Like those bands’ best records, most of   scans like a pocket guide to enacting a   revolution, one where victory is celebrated with a nod and a firm handshake. Most of the songs play out like marching orders. On “Drag,” over a rusted-Slinky guitar line and rigor-mortis percussion, vocalists Sarah, JJ, and Gabe (no last names, please) bellow lyrics that are part insurgent’s instruction manual, part college syllabus on the Situationist movement: “Power in numbers is the failure of lovers/ Make yourself stronger/ disrupt the order.” If all of this makes   sound pretty humorless, that’s because it is—but that’s also the point. There’s something deeply unsettling about the dutiful, expressionless way VATS go about the business of fomenting social change; in their songs, cultural revolution comes because the band has quietly eliminated every other option. To this end,   is disconcertingly effective. “Impenetrable Urge”—the title of which tellingly twists Devo’s “Uncontrollable Urge” into something more opaque—is carved to ribbons by taut slashes of guitar. Its lyrics depict a world where pleasure comes through routine, and its machinelike cadence mirrors that message: “We have no interest in helping with pent-up frustration,” Sarah sternly sings, “We do not owe you counsel.” Their cover of Malaria!’s “Your Turn to Run” is gloomier and feels hollower than the original, crossing it with Wire’s “Being Sucked In Again” and making its lyrics—”There will come a time when I’m your only one”—feel less like a love letter and more like a dictator’s idea of pillow talk. This is  ’s great trick: at a time when young punk bands are railing against systemic injustices with power and force, VATS are pulling a Kraftwerkian bait-and-switch, adopting the ice-cold personalities of authoritarian demagogues as a way to expose their dark, sinister power. By cannily layering messages of revolt in small doses, they feel less like a band, and more like embedded mutineers, sneaking out battle plans by slipping well-placed trigger words into State Addresses. “You deny autonomy/ and I control myself,” Gabe announces on “Half Night.” That VATS plays both sides of that equation so perfectly is what makes   so difficult to shake. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-vats-green-glass-room"}

Fittingly released during a leap year (Arnes named the group after his Feb. 29 birthday), the follow-up to last year’s debut album  marks a significant sea change for the group sonically, with the band stripping down their heady, experimental sound to opt for a more refined, vibrant power-pop, comprised of swooning sing-along melodies, robust and angular guitar and tasteful rhythmic sections. Tracked live with Titus Andronicus guitarist Adam Reich over just three days, the record is immediate from the start, thanks in part to new drummer Alejandro Salazar Dyer. The garage-rock, reflective first single “Alabaster Snow” aptly showcases the album’s focused delivery, with Arnes lamenting about feeling dejected and worn down, atop a bed of boisterous chords paired with meditative,  -esque backing vocals, as he admits “I don’t know what to do/tie me in a bow/or fix me up with glue/I’m broken just like you.” Themes of self-evaluation, anxiety and the passing of time persist throughout, as seen in the airy “One Hit Wonder”—which begins “Are you lost with indecision, or stuck with tunnel vision?/I know there’s more, just beyond the creaky door”—and LP closer “Time Keeps Tickin,’” where baroque string arrangements, recorded with Ava Luna’s Julian Fader and Carlos Hernandez, stun as Arnes croons, “They say that nothing’s ever free/ but time keeps tickin’/I think I’ll be sticking with you.” And even if there aren’t many traces of the group’s complex, psychedelic-DIY foundation, the group’s newfound explicitness and leaner sound will undoubtedly bolster their ascent towards a wider and even more mainstream appeal. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/review-leapling-suspended-animation"}

By the end of  , it becomes clear that it’s a question she can only answer herself. The album’s title positions it as a sequel—the awkward, cruel extension of a life stage few people would willingly revisit. She depicts that tension and confusion with particular pointedness in “Happy,” where the titular emotion finally visits her, only to leave a mess behind. “Well I sighed and mumbled to myself/ ‘Again I have to clean,’” she sings in amusement. The sax riff and dry applause that follows land like a punch line. Subtle images of “pinky promise kisses,” of being the little spoon that “kiss[es] your fingers forever more,” of taking one last look at a lover in the rearview mirror, convey a vulnerable intimacy; it’s as if Mitski, in the midst of self-doubt and anxiety, wants to make herself smaller. Yet throughout the album, those subtleties give way to sudden, explosive moments of exhilaration and self-assertion: slow doo-wop declarations of love in “Once More to See You,” ragged howls and aggressively-strummed guitars in “My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars,” the invasive flash of sweet memories during “one warm summer night” in “Fireworks,” and the fierce look of love on “I Bet on Losing Dogs.” By the record’s end, it’s clear that Mitski has made peace with her question about a “loving feeling.” She finds all of the strength and peace she needs simply by loving herself.

His potent, hollowed-out bass music points back to sound system culture and steppers’ reggae, even as it engineered its low end into something pristine and impossibly heavy. When EDM blew up, Mala could have cashed out. Instead, for his debut album  , he went to Havana, tracked down local musicians and refined a distinctly Afro-Cuban take on bass futurism. His new album   takes a broadly similar approach: this time we find Mala traveling with his laptop through Peru, visiting Lima, Cusco and the Sacred Valley, and winding Afro-Peruvian percussionists and grassroots tap dancers into his insistent sub-bass. The music is sonically robust and rooted in low end, but decorated with unlikely musical detail. On “Kotos,” the pan flutes of marching band Asociacion Juvenil Puno weave through Mala’s hopping pads and echo-soaked snares, while “They’re Coming” and “Shadows” seamlessly meld cool synth washes with clacking hand percussion.

Indeed, Mala at times seems too taken by his subject matter, yet two understated tracks—“Cunumicita” and “Sound Of The River”—peel away the bass and percussion, hanging on the gorgeous vocals of singer-songwriter Danitse and soprano Sylvia Falcón, respectively. And if   can feel a little Buena Vista Social Club in places, that’s far preferable to another bass music record limply rolling out 30-year-old   tropes. Besides, when a record can come up with something as plainly beautiful as “The Calling,” it has much to recommend it. You probably never thought you’d come across a dubstep track that reminded you most of the sparkling guitar miniatures of Vini Reilly’s The Durutti Column. And yet, here we are. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mala-mirrors-review"}

It’s just a few sparse piano notes, with expectant space in between, before subtle shadings of ambient electronics slowly start to fill up the frame, along with a few other elegant adornments: distant synths, floaty flecks of Spanish guitar and what sounds (or just feels) like warm flushes of air pumped into a recording studio. It requires a good bit of confidence to open on a note of such restraint, and the Berlin-based Boysen maintains it throughout an album that only grows stronger as it makes its delicacy more apparent. After the slow-opening reveal of “The Veil,”   sounds as if it was composed as an album, with a steady treatment of a theme that develops, but never loses track of, the ambient gentleness at its core. “Nocturne 3” introduces drums, every tap deliberate and isolated. The eight-minute “Golden Times I” brings more aural material into the mix, including strings, throbbing electronics and synths that bristle with an intensity that surprises but never spills out beyond all the tidy lines and shapes. “Nocturne 4” delivers a sort of culmination off all that has been building before, breaking open into a subtly prog-inflected groove evocative of the French atmospheric duo Air. From there it’s a slow and decorous return to the sparseness at the start, with the memory of all that has transpired during the album’s journey amplifying Boysen’s poignant mix of melancholia and contemplation. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/review-ben-lukas-boysen-spells"}

Shrouded in gentle waves of fuzzed-out guitars and glossy string arrangements, Babinski often serves as her own Greek chorus, tracking her voice on songs like the dreamlife fantasia “No Matter” and the bedheaded, regretful “Your Version Of Me” so that it sounds as if she’s commanding a clutch of ghosts in order to accurately depict her melancholia. It makes for a heady experience; even when the drums are crisp and the violins (played by Babinski herself) have a precision to their swoop, much of   recalls whispering breezes and rippling ponds, gentle reminders of tumult held elsewhere. Babinski usually avoids vibrato, instead taking on a vocal affect that brings to mind Trish Keenan’s matter-of-fact gloominess.

If it means the fanbase that first discovered his MPC  prowess in ’96 still fiends for a return to that inimitable style, so be it; DJ Shadow will be damned if the hip-hop world he grew up in moves on without him. Sometimes he’s gone far afield—his notorious turn towards hyphy on 2006’s   and omnidirectional metal/indie/EDM feints on 2011’s  —but his mistakes, such as they are, remain his own; they don’t come from boredom or laziness, but curiosity and adventure. comes nearly five years after  …, and if time is the most obvious thing separating these two albums, Shadow’s emergence out of the dusty vinyl catacombs to engage more deeply with contemporary alt-beats runs a close second. The album grew out of a prodigal-son-returns DJ gig for Los Angeles’s Low End Theory series, the same turf where instrumental hip-hop heirs like Flying Lotus and Gaslamp Killer went fully cosmic. And what Shadow took away from this rejuvenation wasn’t a renewed urge to lay down more door-kicking breaks—it’s a sense of nuance and distance, Ableton-manipulated live instruments given room to breathe and unfurl amidst the chopped-up but often sparse beats. Case in point: “Nobody Speak” features  threatening their customary beatings to assorted wild animals and members of your family, but its skulking boom-bap simmer is twangy, playful, and slyly casual compared to El-P’s usual production slate of intense hydraulic-press low-end. And DJ Shadow gets better the subtler he is, letting the negative space breathe through dubby reverb elsewhere to stunning effect. The glitchy, gliding burble of the Nils Frahm teamup “Bergschrund,” the spiritual-jazz haze of “Ashes to Oceans” (featuring a misty waterfront noir trumpet from Manchester’s Matthew Halsall) and the Daedalus-via-Broadcast eeriness of “Pitter Patter” (a collab with Bleep Bloop and Nite School Klik partner G. Jones, signees to Shadow’s label Liquid Amber) reveal Shadow’s best impulses these days lie not in massive drums and aggro riffs but in the haunting, wistful ear for melody that’s laced his best tracks from the start. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/review-dj-shadow-mountain-will-fall"}

Parker left Chicago for L.A. a few years ago, but his latest album as a bandleader,  , has its roots in his old home.   grew out of beat and sample-based projects Parker started years before relocating. He then enlisted drummer Jamire Williams, saxophonist Josh Johnson and bassist Paul Bryan to flesh out those old concepts.

Talking about what makes him great means omitting his last two albums, 2012’s overstuffed prog-freakout  and the electro-disco-pop  , and going back to his late ’00s peak, when his sophisticated-yet-joyful style of sumptuous house was in demand. Lindstrøm’s  EP isn’t exactly a throwback to the late ’00s of  with its stratospheric Vangelis/Göttsching sprawl, but it still has enough moments of anthemic cosmic-disco to indicate he’s regained his footing. “Closing Shot” is the standout, a dose of handclaps-and-hi-hats dancefloor classicism that plays up his sound’s easy integration with classic ’80s boogie funk and Detroit techno chord progressions. It’s one of his best concentrated doses of quality house since 2005’s “I Feel Space.” “Algorytme” is a slightly sharper-edged cut that lets the melody sneak its way between minimal flourishes and intricate builds; the underlying groove pairs synth-bass and conga in ways that’ll send listeners fiddling with their EQ to maximize the low end. The all-enveloping synthpop glide of “Foehn” is pure frictionless forward motion that makes triple-digit BPMs feel like floating without gravity.  It’s encouraging enough that  feels like Lindstrøm never left.

But on their follow-up,  , the California group has taken the opposite approach. With Jason Quever of indie rock band Papercuts on the boards, Sugar Candy Mountain largely abandon their maximalist soundscapes, opting instead for sparse arrangements that throw the group’s lyrical guitar figures and the voice of frontwoman Ash Reiter into sharp relief. While buried Reiter in the mix, on   she cuts through like a laser. Her voice is a brilliant and complex instrument; in the course of a single line, like the one that gives the album its title, she is able to sound both sweet and steeled, menacing and serene. Throughout   Reiter turns her gaze to profound questions of existence, and the mysterious quality of her voice makes the open-ended questions in her lyrics feel all the more haunting. For every mesmerizing hook Reiter sings, there’s a guitar part of equal magnitude. Opening track “Windows” is ripped apart by a harrowing and buzzing solo, and on “Tired” a serpentine riff nods strongly to the album’s surf-rock influences. Now that they’ve been given the proper space to shine, these elements drive home the message at the core of Sugar Candy Mountain’s sophomore album: sometimes less can be much more.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/review-sugar-candy-mountain-666"}

Together, their harmonies morph into one loud political gesture. “Daddy Warbucks,” like “Eat Them,” is another feminist cry. Recalling Lucy Dacus’ warm songwriting style, it’s a bright, inviting, straightforward indie rock song. And though it’s easy to get lost in the bliss, it’s next to impossible to miss the line: “Daddy Warbucks / I give no fucks.” It builds with the same sweet and salty resilience as Heavenly’s “C Is The Heavenly Option.” “Seven Days” opens with a chugging, distorted guitar—Thin Lizzy-as-covered-by-Sheer-Mag. “Space Invaders” crescendos into an unexpected, stringed coda. “Irrelevant” will leave Mitski fans satisfied.

Her voice may raise a few octaves when delivering macabre lyrics about depression and death, but it never cracks or wavers. Which is not to say that   is one-note—it’s not. It’s just carefully composed. Jordan’s plaintive, deliberate storytelling style is the perfect complement to her band’s mellowed-out music. Most of the songs on   are built on measured drumming and soft, hypnotic riffs. Jordan is a self-deprecating songwriter, often evoking the decay and sediment of the natural world to get at her reflexive feelings; she likens herself to a gastropod (“Slug”) and begs to be covered in flies (“Static Buzz”). On “Dirt,” she waxes philosophical, looking to the future in an attempt to overcome her present woes. “Baby, when I’m 30, I’ll laugh about how dumb it felt,” she sings, “And, oh God, it’s not funny, but I know we can laugh it out.” It’s a song about getting perspective and letting go gracefully, and Jordan articulates this sentiment with a dexterity that’s rare for a lyricist who’s not yet 18. Throughout  Jordan excels at self-reflection, interrogating herself before turning to others. On “Stick,” the album’s most minimal—and, arguably, most compelling—track, the percussion drops out, the guitars get sparse, and Jordan sings: “Do you dream about the people that wrong you? Do you see those faces again and again?/ And what holy thing has come to possess you? Or does it all just blend together in your head?” It’s a fitting conclusion to an album that establishes Jordan as both a diarist and a storyteller;   is the voice of a young woman in full control of her own nascent—and ascendant—narrative. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/snail-mail-habit-review"}

Led by the sing-speak squeals of Veronica Torres—and rounded out by Jon Campolo’s ragtag riffs, Andrew Spaulding’s lumbering drum lines, and Benjamin Jaffe’s slippery sax—the quartet is out for blood on its debut full-length,  . Heated, with a refreshing sense of humor, the band’s spring-loaded caterwaul is like  without the body count. They’re frustrated, yes—but Pill wilds out with a wink as they explore the weightiest of issues. And while shades of X-Ray Spex, Bush Tetras, and James Chance pop up in their manic music, this is no-wave for a new age only in terms of its attitude. Free-jazz, noise, and improv also inform everything Pill does. Which, come to think of it, was no-wave’s point—obliterating the boundaries punk had set up for itself. Or as Lunch once said, “Yes, we were angry, ugly, snotty, and loud. But better to brutalize the audience with screeching guitars and piercing screams than to beat them over the head with fists and feet… which, okay,   we did, but most nights we’d rather fuck than fight.” —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/pill-convenience-review"}

Cologne-based producer and DJ Marius Lauber chose his presidential alias on a whim so he could play his first gig. Many sold-out shows later, Lauber delivers Roosevelt’s first LP, and it couldn’t have arrived at a more fortuitous time, when bands like S U R V I V E have generated new interest in doomy synth music. On these 12 tracks,   imbues disco-pop with masterful synth layering influenced by Neu! and Ash Ra Tempel. The result hits a sweet spot between the works of John Carpenter and St. Pepsi, and Phoenix’s “Fences”—a moody, Balearic record primed for dour dance floors full of people trying hard to not try too hard. The excellent “Night Moves” beams seamlessly from pure pop to stalwart shuffle as Lauber guides the sunset (“There’s no reason to hide/ You know the night goes on and on”). The meteoric synth flourishes on “Wait Up” crash into the hook, then carry its funk debris onward. “Fever” takes the looping synth from “Daytona” and transforms it from skeleton to superhuman, baptizing the chorus with a cascade of five notes.

Primarily hailing from Angola, Cape Verde, and Guinea-Bissau, the rhythms that these new producers create draw on kuduro, zouk, batucada, kizomba, and tarraxinha, as well as footwork and hip-hop. But taxonomy isn’t as useful as the one word that covers it all: “batida”—my beat. It’s a manic, mutant, trickster sound, one usually restricted to online forums and in the tenement housing well outside of Lisbon. But Principe’s efforts have seen a great deal of this music released, usually on vinyl in hand-painted record sleeves as rough and striking as the music itself. This 23-track compilation is even handier, though, providing an immediate (and thorough) glimpse of this ever-changing sound. It familiarizes newcomers to the scene’s elders (still in their 20s for the most part), people like Marfox, Firmeza, and Nigga Fox, and also introduces up-and-comers. Marfox (the godfather of the scene, as you’ll note from the number of producers who have adopted his –fox suffix) contributes “Swaramgami,” which spins so fast it becomes giddy 140bpm gibberish; Nigga Fox’s “Lua” moves from a hiccupping hand drum pattern into an electro-asthma attack. The influx of new talent brings new wrinkles to batida. Puto Marcio’s “Não-Queiras-Ser” adds a minor-key synth wash to the tricky percussion so it arcs like a shooting star, while DJ CiroFox adds a smooth R&B melody. It promises that the scene might soon grow beyond both its sonic and geographical confines.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mambos-levis-doutro-mundo-review"}

You remember his drums—the way they snapped, and the way they seemed ill-timed, yet perfectly on rhythm. Though his music scanned as hip-hop, Dilla dabbled in soul, jazz and electronica before his tragic death in 2006 at the age of 32. Kanye West and Pharrell have taken sonic cues from Dilla, and producers  ,   and Flying Lotus acknowledge his influence. Now add  , an electronic quartet from Portland, Maine. Of the group’s origins, keyboardist Hassan Muhammad says “Dilla is the common thread for how we all met and began playing together.” The group started recording collectively in 2009, and on its new album  , you can hear ties to the Dilla’s creative approach—though the end result lands closer to Flying Lotus circa 2008.   thrives on that same sort of loose electro-rap fusion, but the quartet’s blend feels light and improvised, skewed more towards jazz. The LP doesn’t lock into a singular groove, pivoting instead between pronounced and ambient soundscapes for a breezy, nuanced listen. On “Side King,” for example, wafting keys conjure pastoral images—you can almost   the sun-drenched beaches, the water washing up the shore. “Lead Sister” evokes similar scenery, yet the vibe is more festive due to a cavernous drum stomp. Mixing live and electronic elements,   feels relaxed, like four friends banging out a few cuts in a home studio just for fun. Albums are tough to pull off without a strong vocal narrative, but Jaw Gems have created a work that’s remarkably visual and nomadic, full of radiant energy that stays with you for its duration. This is the album you play when you want to go somewhere, when the destination doesn’t matter, and the road is unclear.

Nowadays, it feels more closely tied to post-backpacker hip-hop than it ever was with the hardcore or crossover thrash of skateboarding in the ’80s. Steven Caple Jr.’s film  takes full advantage of this, and not just by its association with executive producer Nas. The soundtrack for the film, in which aspiring young Cleveland skaters’ petty crimes spiral into something more ambitious and dangerous, gives the film’s place in hip-hop a deep focus. The soundtrack isn’t exploitatively star-packed, nor is it overly reliant on trying to break unknown indie favorites. It’s more of a mood-setting companion piece to a film uninterested in easy triumph. The big names get a decent amount of shine: Machine Gun Kelly, who appears in the film as a convenience store employee, fits the vibe well, even if the hesher-rock simplicity of “Dopeman” won’t win too many skeptical converts in the “real hip-hop” set. And the beatless orchestral moodiness of “This Bitter Land,” a teamup between Nas and Erykah Badu (who has a small role as a sex worker in the film), is an allusive, impressive display of both artists’ respective vocal chops. But even with big-name artists pulling the weight—there’s a Kanye-featuring French Montana cut and a Pusha T/Jeremih collab—it’s the artists closer to the skate-rap underground who make the most of it. Fashawn’s character portrait “Cisco’s Theme,” the chest-collapsing bass panic of Jerreau’s “Looking for Something,” and the Dilla-via-Carpenter drones of Nosaj Thing’s instrumental score come closest to nailing that sense of rootless, teenage dread.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-land-soundtrack-review"}

While repetition is still at the root of every recording, lulling the listener into a stupefied state, Miller has never come this close to making Factory-issued post-punk before. Admittedly, this is the kind of post-punk that only exists in the Horseback universe, a shifty place where the dark side of the human condition is explored, peppered with allusions to everyone from Carl Jung, David Cronenberg (the album’s named after one of his creeptastic films), and Joseph Campbell to Joy Division, Coil, and This Heat. So, no, the horse-riding death goddess on this album cover is not a heavy-metal nod, signalling a return to Miller’s blustery, blackened roots. Much like his   EP,  is more of a meditative journey, letting minimal synth lines and circuitous rhythms lead the way instead of screams, screeches, and squeals. No wonder Miller has been name-dropping folks like The Field, Terry Riley, and Laurie Spiegel lately.

A tale old as time, really, and like the best science fiction, it feels eerily familiar, a reflection of cities (including composer Matthew Finch’s current home of Brooklyn) reshaped by financial matters and fantasy. Finch’s uncomfortably numb narrative is told through two main characters—nameless, faceless visions of “him” and “her” trying to come to grips with a crumbling middle class and a society that sees nothing wrong with branding everyone’s belief system. Or, as Finch writes in the album’s theatrical liner notes, “I moved out here, to this mecca, because I believed in a story about this culture; because I believed in a myth about opportunity. I had no idea what I was participating in; I had no idea that I was an identity product of the elite knowledge workers of the middle class and acting as a symbol … promoting the culture and lifestyle of bourgeois materialism.” Which is really a roundabout way of saying what we all think when a luxe condo building bursts out of concrete, promising a boho lifestyle to all its lessees. As for what that   like, Finch doesn’t spell anything out. He stretches the  storyline across three long instrumentals that alternate between stormy ambient sequences, woofer-wrecking bass lines, and meditative drone tones. Remember that   no one saw last year? This is what would have happened if   was hired to do the score, which was tweaked slightly by the studio—just enough to show a few signs of hope, which glimmer until M.O.T.H.’s next LP, at least.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/m-o-t-h-westside-industrial-review"}

So does Bright’s husky croon—like a weathered Junior Boys: slightly goofy, slightly aggrieved. It also helps that the lyrics are part and parcel of the music’s gently tripped-out tenor. Hairy Hands’  , has a concept (the search for a new planet for humanity to habit after making a mess of this one), but the words catch and hold even if you don’t grok that part. The lyric “It’s hard to not flow through the porthole” nicely abets the telephone dial tone, smudged brass lines, thwocking percussion, and random FX drops of “Suns,” while the refrain of “Wings” — “I love your wings, lady” — has a similarly apt relationship to the music’s strange stops-starts, and its almost comically delicate piano line alternating with an ostentatious bass line of the latter.

On their new album  , these worlds take a multitude of forms, each one as engrossing as the next.  is The Album Leaf’s sixth studio album and first for Relapse, after a run of full-lengths for Sub Pop and a string of soundtrack work and collaborations. While the once-solo project has long since turned into a group effort, this album is the first to be recorded and produced with an entire band. And it shows: The Album Leaf no longer sound like an augmented LaValle endeavor; the newly-minted band vigorously guides the Rhodes-driven melodies and fleshes out the post-rock dynamics with ambient synths and keyboards, driving percussion, and swelling trumpet work for music that’s at once celebratory and solemn, evocative and present. But The Album Leaf’s articulation of presence has always been dependent on a wholesale subscription to Western harmonic conventions in order to fulfill its life-affirming promises. In this sense, what The Album Leaf’s music actually affirms is the impossibility of security. The emotions and memories conjured here are marked by a transitory in-between-ness, set in an otherwise chaotic, unpredictable world. But it’s in these crevices and fleeting moments where the music finds its most exquisite expressions.

On the three records they’ve released on the venerable Canadian label Profound Lore—2011’s  , 2013’s  , and now  the band has taken increasing advantage of the unique strengths its odd lineup affords. ’s superb opening track, the 15-minute “Despair is a Siren,” is a perfect snapshot of the band’s evolution. Sarah Pendleton and Kim Pack’s violins are the focal point, and they appear not with dramatic bow strokes, but with muted pizzicato, more percussive than melodic. Then comes the eruption: guitarist and lead vocalist Rebecca Vernon ominously intones, “I see the bars of the cage,” and a cacophony of strings swells and crashes like ocean waves in a thunderstorm. The wild, churning movements that follow justify the song’s epic length, and the three other tracks that cross the 10-minute mark do the same. But SubRosa are also adept making things heavier without necessarily making them louder. There are countless small moments on  the emphasis on a syllable, a moan of bass feedback, a split-second of harmony between the two violins—that give the album nuance and character. Where many doom bands turn to volume and repetition as conduits for increased emotional heft, the musicians in SubRosa have found an invisible world in those little spaces that makes them as devastating as any of their contemporaries. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/subrosa-for-this-we-fought-review"}

The dusty sweep of his violin, underpinned by synthetic drones and melodies are present to soothe the spirit. The boom of a kick drum, or the Steve Reichian marimba pulses, or the clang of a tuning fork, brusquely bring you back to center whenever your attention wanders. That seems to have been at least partially Tignor’s intention with this record, too; the accompanying notes claim that it was written and performed to help listeners “transcend and reclaim ourselves from the noise of public living.” Hyperbolic as that might sound, it provides a fine framework through which to appreciate this collection. Through its peaks of volume and bouts of dissonance, the album works well as a bulwark against the ambient clatter of everyday life. Beyond that, there’s the sheer technical mastery on display in  . Tignor recorded the entire thing by himself—live, using software of his own devising that helped him trigger samples and manipulate the sound of his instruments as he played them.

Retreating into introspection— specifically, the stoned fantasies of the ‘60s—almost feels irresponsible in a world that demands engagement with the present. Though he lives in Los Angeles and wears his hair long, multi-instrumentalist Morgan Delt must understand this.  , his first album since leaving Chicago retro-rock label Trouble in Mind for Sub Pop, bathes serious anxieties about contemporary life in lysergic sunlight. You only have to squint a bit to identify the shadows on the horizon. The sounds of vultures circling and windstorms brewing in so many tracks’ long, ominous outros might be your first hint. Opener “I Don’t Wanna See What’s Happening Outside” sets up the dissonance between style and theme. Steel drum sounds splash like pebbles tossed into a stream. The buzzing in the background could be cicadas. Delt’s guitar ripples gently, his voice full of hippie sweetness. But he’s singing about witnessing, and turning away from, atrocities: “I saw bodies devoured / It’s no business of mine / You know I’m only a coward.” Given the news from Orlando, Baton Rouge, Milwaukee: it could be the song of the summer. Delt gets explicitly topical on “The System of 1000 Lies,” letting a reverent hush fall over anticapitalist salvos and clickbait clichés like “one weird trick.” More often, though, the visions of environmental apocalypse and human cruelty he buries under glittering instrumentals could come straight out of classic dystopic fiction.  may sound like the Summer of Love, but it reverberates with the fear that winter is coming.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/morgan-delt-phase-zero-review"}

It starts almost from the get-go, with the ominous, unidentified men in black suits who seem to be trailing protagonist Elliot Alderson no matter where he goes. Each new plot twist reveals deeper levels to the show’s overarching conspiracy, making it difficult to determine which characters are trustworthy. Over time, that paranoia begins to seep out of the screen and into the viewer; Elliott’s Dissociative Identity Disorder makes him the ultimate unreliable narrator and, as the show goes on, it becomes hard to know whether or not the show’s hero—who frequently breaks the fourth wall to speak to us directly—is telling the truth (the whopper of a reveal midway through Season Two is the perfect illustration of the lengths to which he’s willing to go in order to deceive us). One of his most frequently-repeated requests, “Please tell me you’re seeing this, too,” can be read as both a desire for allegiance as well as a test to see if his bait-and-switch with the viewer is working. And so it’s natural that a show that thrives on anxiety should be accompanied by an appropriately anxious soundtrack. The songs by Mac Quayle on the soundtracks to both the first and   are built on low-level synth pulses, the kinds of songs that swell slowly to gradually create an atmosphere of panic that’s suffocating. It would be convenient shorthand to call it “synthwave,” but the music here has none of that genre’s cutting, laser-sword dynamics. Instead, it feels more like a robotic EKG: on “1.0_2-oneincontrol.aiff” (the song titles mirror the episode titles’ computer-code structure,” the sound is barely present, just a few rising, misty synths over a blinking, dead-eyed bass note. When the tempos do tick upward, as on “1.0_6-leavem3here.flac,” with its syringe-pokes of guitar, there’s enough space between the notes to let the panic sweat pool. Divorced from the show,   plays best as discomfort music for insomniac conspiracy theorists. How else to explain “1.3_5-da3m0nsneverstop.ca,” a song whose gentle sawing keyboards seem designed to accompany 3am deep-dives in search of a connection between Stanley Kubrick and the moon landing. The second volume is darker still, notes barely emerging above a sickening bass rumble—perfect for the underrated season’s more muted, cerebral tone.

James Alex and Co. could have continued to explore that record’s quieter moments, growing progressively introspective and, God forbid, “mature.” Or, they could have doubled down on the crash and pop. As evidenced by the first few seconds of “Future Mixtape for the Art Kids,” Alex opted for the latter. “Play it loud/ Play it fast,” he implores, an opening salvo that makes no apologies for staying right in the established Beach Slang sonic and lyrical pocket.   is more brash and hardcore than  , and in its full-throttle approach, it feels more like a debut than sophomore release.

Beach Slang make anthems that tap into the indie rock ethos of “our band could be your life,” igniting that heart-spark discovery when someone speaks your language, and capturing the reckless energy of living three lifetimes in one night. It’s all epic, and for the most part, it continues to work. The one track that feels forced, “Atom Bomb,” taps back into the hardcore past of Alex’s former band  , but it never really captures that band’s ebullience. The rest of the album clicks along at an almost unbearably fast pace, pausing only to tip its hat to Alex’s hero Paul Westerberg on standouts “Wasted Daze of Youth” and “Young Hearts.” Both songs are big, major-chord salutes to gutter fuckups and desperately wasted dreamers. While Slang salutes their heroes openly, what makes this band so special is Alex’s heart. It’s all over the record: open, unencumbered by allegory or cheap sentimentality.

The backdrop was dilapidated, underserved and surprisingly white. Peckham, and its neighboring area Camberwell, form one of the most ethnically-diverse pockets of the United Kingdom. It’s a cultural melting pot of Black African, Black Caribbean, Asian, Indian, White British, and many other ethnicities. For 25 years, it’s been home to some of my family; Vietnamese who pitched up there in the early ’90s and have since made it the home of a new generation of British-born children. Over the quarter-century, they’ve seen the area develop from the destitution depicted on   into one of the capital’s most exciting cultural centers. It’s where South East Londoners Yussef Dayes and Kamaal Williams—releasing music together as Yussef Kamaal—came together as teenagers in 2007, bringing their brand of smooth jazz to small crowds in local bars.

It’s a jazz record in the spirit of Blue Note’s finest recordings, but this sonic stew incorporates boogie, afrobeat, funk, hip-hop and the spirit of Roy Ayers, too. The arrangements are satin-smooth. The drums are crisp and funky, and the bass floats majestically throughout the record. “Yo Chavez” is built around a squelchy synth that’s pure aural candy. The bass-heavy bounce of “Lowrider” takes the curbs with a cosmic swagger. It’s ’67 Chevy tour of South East London, with nothing but sleek tarmac under the tires. Closer “Joint 17” encapsulates the album’s freewheeling excellence. The keys purr with soft sophistication, and are accented with popping bass and snaps. The drum breaks could launch 1,000 rap beats, and it’s the exclamation point on one of the year’s best jazz records.

The album has an almost classic vaporwave sound, full of hallucinogenic soundscapes, video game homages, and woozy synthesizers. While this might make it seem somewhat unoriginal, Equip pulls it off; each track is a fully fleshed-out progression of articulate melodies and engrossing chords. It’s a transportive and ethereal release, but also one that may sound reassuringly familiar to acolytes of the genre. The 25 tracks create the sense of a return to some primal state of peace—perhaps in this case, the ‘90s. They take some of the most blissfully tranquil and transportive synth-based music the genre has produced in some time, and they conjure otherworldly atmospheres. This mixture of floating, spacey music with a subtle vibe of familiarity has the effect of transforming  into something of an enjoyable contradiction. Have we heard such dreamy trips as “Reunited” and “D r u i d s [Encounter]” before, or is their welcoming aura simply a deception intended to hide how their alienness might change us from within? Their reverb-laden keys and 8-bit chirping fail to make the answer to this question any clearer since, even though they recall everything from ’80s sci-fi to ’90s video games, they slot their elements into tight, progressive compositions that end up being more than the sum of their parts. also ends up sounding like more than a debut. Rather than giving the impression of inexperience or rash over-exuberance, beatific songs like “D U N G E O N” and “Identity” stand as near-masterful balances of journeying melodies and weightless ambience. With them, Equip doesn’t simply take the listener on a voyage, but also takes vaporwave to new levels of compositional and emotional depth. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/equip-i-dreamed-of-a-palace-in-the-sky-review"}

For Sweden’s  , the answers to these questions are twofold: you flood your world with as much audiovisual stimuli as possible, and raise an army of questions in the process. How does the communal isolation of Goat’s Korpilombolo hometown inform the band’s boundary-free mélange of psych rock, krautrock, Scandinavian folk, and Afrobeat? Is the baroque-pop by-way-of King-Sunny-Ade in “Trouble In the Streets” a commentary on Goat’s West African dress? What process generates songs like “I Sing In Silence” and “Try My Robe,” peculiar feats in which Incredible String Band-esque finger-picking winds around propulsive basslines, djembe, and punky, shouted vocals? Did they give a tapestry of Persian acid-rock ambience a South African name—“Ubuntu”—just to fuck with us? On Goat’s third album,  , the roving collective casts the broadest possible net, anchoring all of their stylistic left turns with enough conviction to make them land, no matter how flittery the pan flute gets.

The Mahayana Buddhists believe the symbol was invented by Buddha himself as a way to help people understand his teachings. The (primarily) black metal band of the same name explore similar themes. Their compositions are cyclical; they spin like wheels, with guitar riffs spiraling inward toward blistering rhythms and sermon-like vocals. While blast beats and turmoil reign supreme across  , there’s order amidst the chaos. There may be full-on anarchy in “Oceans of Existence,” but the more atmospheric moments, on tracks like “The Burden of Attachment” and “Sybaritic Apparitions,” provide not only structure but relief. Intense, Liszt-like piano passages on “Prelude,” and flamenco guitar on “Rivers of Transmigration,” collide with the technical instrumental brilliance of “Untitled.” Bhavachakra’s musical interests are far-reaching, and their songs are large enough to contain them all. Throughout the record, Bhavachakra use confusion, discordance and disarray to explore dualism, human existence, and the death of the planet. But what’s most remarkable is that, for all its force and power, it never feels hindered by the genre’s constraints. Rather, it uses those techniques as a foundation to establish a cyclical work of art, one that weaves together technique, skill, philosophy, and pure guts. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/bhavachakra-self-titled-review"}

In fact,  journeys through the starlit skies of the two men’s samplers and sequencers with a modest but sure sense of purpose, even when they seem to dawdle. The 10 track names correspond with their sequence on the album—it opens with “First, Consider the Lillies,” ends on “The 10 Sultans Of Rudyard (Moo Moo Mix).” Yet despite the mischievous glints audible throughout (and visible in the title),  isn’t a silly record. Older and less prone to pure goofiness, Paterson and Fehlmann here make the icy keyboard lines and deep-echoing horns of “Wireless MK2,” and the gently chopped-up orchestra of “7 Oaks” seem both modest and effulgent. This is the Orb’s most genuinely ambient album, and the timing of its release, in the midst of massive global tensions, is especially fortuitous. That’s the case even as they nod slyly to their own past, as on the album’s highlight, “9 Elms Over River Eno (Channel 9).” With its CB-radio voice samples and twinkling minimalist loop, it’s an update of the ingredients that made the Orb’s first big hit, “Little Fluffy Clouds.” But the mission has changed, from chilling out as a break from dancing to chilling out as a break from a world that requires one. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-orb-chill-out-world-review"}

It’s a familiar theme, with many pitfalls—the proclamations of grandeur that register as uncomfortably un-ironic, the florid raving, the way  , on 2015’s  mistook ensemble incoherence for liberated improvisation.  however, finds Rønnenfelt and a cast of players focused and relatively toned down, having perhaps realized that sleazy nuance and shifty restraint is the best way to explore excess. It’s to the credit of the album overall that the supple, featherweight beauty of single “Heart of Life”—which luxuriates in spare piano and mesh-like percussive texture, exquisitely denying an expected climax—doesn’t outshine the other eight songs. Marching Church is a big band here, with about a dozen players on the record (including, crucially, Lower’s remarkably poised rhythm section), but it sounds like a small one: viola and saxophone, trumpet and flute—they’re garnish and zest, emphasizing and at the right times undercutting Rønnenfelt’s stagy delivery. A legible and resonant metaphor, “Inner City Pigeon” finds Rønnenfelt observant yet detached from urbanites, coasting past windows and “never coming down.” The song, with its atmosphere of velvety murk, makes potent that sense of debauched estrangement that stalks his catalog. Feel how the woozy bass and sagging toms approximate listless, weary flight. That is, until a cymbal bell and skittering, discordant strings sound alarm.

The result is a kind of expansive intimacy. “For as long as I can remember, I have found that what draws me to a piece of music can often be one small detail—a single characteristic or maybe a fleeting moment of beautiful sound or compelling rhythm,” Acheson explains in the album notes. On   that approach is on full display. The first track presents the entire finished composition. Then, the deconstruction begins: Each instrument or layer of sound is relegated to its own track, then listed as numbered “Sources.” Songs like “Wingbeats Source II – Cello” and field recordings like “Wingbeats Source VI – Dawn Chorus” offer up-close looks at the different components of the fully-assembled title track. The entire composition has a meditative force—a sonic balm to counter our age of deep anxiety. On the opening “Wingbeats,  church bells mingle with a flock of birds recorded in the snowy French Alps; a bass clarinet line delivers swelling, lyrical melodies, and a singing saw provides a gentle harmony.

Its songs morph as surprisingly as the color clouds in   or   for his excellent 2014 collaboration with astrophysicist/saxophonist Stephon Alexander,  . The primary theme across the Brooklyn producer’s full-length solo debut,  , is combative rhythmic interplay: Trap beats become stuttering free-jazz improvisations (“Aphasia”), then degrade into system-overload digital hardcore (“Synapse”) and haunted two-step (“Prime Matter”). There are nods to ambient and process music, too; single “Unfamiliar Cloud” explores the overlap between the piano licks that drive Radiohead’s recent “Daydreaming” and the stratified rhythmic interplay of Steve Reich. Throughout, Rioux’s smudged, reticent vocals — think a hoarser, more funereal Owen Pallett—drift in the middle of the mix. In polyglottish music like this, it’s easy for the disparate stylistic elements to cancel out a clear artistic signature. But Rioux distinguishes himself by making his thirst for staking out uncharted territory infectious.   isn’t ‘Like Nothing You’ve Ever Heard Before,’ but it’s just surprising enough.

Take “Montauk Blues,” a noise-punk barrage that comes off like Pissed Jeans if they swapped out emotional vomit for the real deal. There’s some churn in the track’s midsection that’s more Kilslug than Killdozer, but it’s too single-minded in its delirium to approach psychedelia. Throughout the EP, burly chord triplets brawl with relentless feedback before inevitably turning their fists back on you, the onlooker. “Vamp” kicks off with a Flipper-gone-pop progression and kicks it in the head just as quickly.

Since their acclaimed 2010 debut, vocalist Mara TK and producer Taay Ninh have gradually transcended their neo-soul beginnings, moving toward a bigger, more psychedelic sound. That’s not to say   or its predecessor, 2014’s  , completely abandon the group’s musical roots. But they’re clearly evolving—pushing themselves further, and digging deep to explore a new level of songwriting.   is a slow-burner, an album reveals its true magnitude over time. Its nine tracks were mostly created by TK and Ninh, but they benefit from the appearance of a few carefully-placed guests. On opener “ ,” rap producer Just Blaze adds light touches to the spare, melancholy beat, and the woozy, gauzy “ ,” wouldn’t be nearly as transcendent without the heavenly vocals of rising Hawaiian singer Deva Mahal. But   succeeds mainly because of TK and Ninh, whose music remains comprehensive and unique at the same time. They tease big bass drops and embrace Radiohead-like bliss on “I Light a Candle,” and, on the gently-weaving “Red Window,” they blend a thick low-end with slowly-winding vocals and curlicues of guitar. But beyond the musicality, there’s power in TK’s lyrics. He often speaks in riddles, but there are clear protest anthems here. “Aeons,” “March” and even “OH I”—with its Biblical references—all carry weight without being on the nose. The intention is clear:   aims to enthrall with its music, and uplift with its words. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/electric-wire-hustle-the-11th-sky-review"}

At times,   nods to contemporary genres like grime, drone, and techno, but the musicians do a masterful job of blending the live instruments into the mix, weaving esoteric twists throughout the album.

The two recorded their self-titled debut in fits and starts between Dust’s apartment in Nottingham, England and Mockasin’s place in Wellington, New Zealand. The resulting album is charmingly unorthodox, landing squarely in the Roxy Music art-pop tradition. Opening track “Relaxed Lizard” plays like scrambled disco, flavored with bongos. “Jealous Lies” is reggae funk with strategically-placed synths. “In Love” is a languid R&B song with exotic beats, instrumental fills, and layered vocals. Hearing two different male voices layered atop one another is still relatively uncommon—even moreso when each boasts a distinct falsetto. “Alive Without Medicine” is surf rock for stoned surfers, and the woozy synths and glimpses of percussive funk keep it floating in the stratosphere. Though Soft Hair borrows from an eclectic batch of genres, their sound is remarkably cohesive—falsetto vocals, dreamy synths, and Will Ricketts’ masterful percussion blending seamlessly.

But time has a funny way of sanding the edges of bands that once seemed confrontational. Music that felt oppressive two decades ago now wouldn’t sound out of place in commercial hip-hop songs, and some of the ‘80s most extreme genres—industrial music, in particular—now sound quaint and kitschy. Not so with Slug: the 18 songs that make up this collection still feel like repeated right-hooks from a studded boxing glove. Slug has no use for melody: “Freak of Nature” pits a preacher’s ranting and raving against guitars that groan like the failing engine on an old Camaro. The song bludgeons with repetition: the same pitch black four-note chord pattern buzzsaws over and over and over—like the noise rock version of water torture. “Elevator,” the closest thing on the record to a “single,” takes the notion of industrial music literally, with rhythms that sound like they’re being beaten out on hubcaps and guitars that are all feedback, no tone. And “Pink Party Dessert” hits the gut like a cement medicine ball, 400-ton guitars whaling away at the same note  . The closest analogue would be the similarly-maniacal anarcho-noise of New York’s Missing Foundation, but the fact that Slug keep halfheartedly feinting toward conventional pop structures—a chorus here, a middle eight there—makes their music feel more subversive, as if they’re providing us with entryways just to destroy them.

The UK duo Sun Palace achieved that honor in 1983, when “Rude Movements,” the B-side to their 1983 12″ “Winning,” became a staple of The Loft, Mancuso’s exclusive, invite-only dance party. The song developed during a jam session in a home studio between Mike Collins and Keith O’Connell. Because neither Collins nor O’Connell is a drummer, they built the track on a hissy-but-sinuous Roland CR-78 analog rhythm machine beat. Thanks the deft interplay of looming synths and soul-jazz guitars, “Rude Movements” played out like the offspring of cosmic disco and jazz fusion, a masterpiece of immersive smoothness, made DIY style. The compilation  sets that single alongside an exhaustive collection of early ’80s demos and unreleased cuts, taking one chapter of the Sun Palace story and expanding it to novel-length. On   Sun Palace’s music feels like an expansion of the proto-Balearic vibes popular at The Loft, into more ambitious terrain. Midtempo stargazers like “What’s The Time” and “I’m Going to Lie Down” (which adds percolating flute into the mix) will satisfy those looking for a sequel to “Rude Movements,” but electro heads will find pop-lock motivation in “Coral Reef” and “I Want You.” Cuts like “Love Train II” and “The Funkier Worm (Oscar From Hell),” positioned as sequels to classic ‘70s songs, offer insight into the duo’s inspiration.

Crump’s also been fond of duo projects, like his vibrant outing with saxophonist   and a long-running combo with guitarist   called  .

He assembled a strong, versatile quartet for  , enlisting the magnificent, polystylistic drummer  —whom he’s often worked with alongside Iyer—and two horn players that he yearned to play with; the exciting young trumpeter Adam O’Farrill and the veteran tenor saxophonist Ellery Eskelin. The keyboard-free combo brings a delicious airiness to the pieces Crump wrote, all of which allow the players considerable creative latitude and aural space. With the opening track “NoD for Nelson,” a piece that suggests a blues progression but with a sly chordal substitution, the band achieves the leader’s intended effect of saluting the great composer and arranger Oliver Nelson, with its hint of “Stolen Moments.” The group swings hard through the tricky melody of “Skippaningam,” opening up for some terrific multi-linear improvisation by the horn players, who blow terse phrases that dance around one another with preternatural intimacy. Given the loose funk groove Sorey imparts to “Esquima Dream,” it’s surprising to know that it’s the one piece here that was originally composed for Rosetta Trio, because its stabbing horn parts seem tailor-made for this combo. The two-part closer “Pulling Pillars—Outro for Patty” delivers a meditative farewell; solemn, spiritual, and, ultimately, celebratory.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/stephan-crump-rhombal-review"}

But as Quicksails, Billington opts for a more meditative, serene approach. His work under that moniker is constantly transforming: his 2015 album   alternated between moments of stately synth grandeur and computer-meltdown bleeps and crackles;  , released that same year, was ghostly and ominous—a long, weightless float through the unlit hallways of the Discovery One. All of them contained moments of defiance and difficulty—passages where the bottom seemed to drop out, instruments collapsed, and chaos reigned. In this context,   is Billington’s most straightforward and melodic work to date. It has the same galactic reach as  , but trades that album’s sinister mood for the soft twinkle of starlight. Album opener “Valley Voice” contrasts theremin-like synths with Carlos Chavarria’s mournful sax; “The Compound Blues” is build on a jazz-like brush-snare rhythm, Chavarria turning up again to weave drowsily through a plunking acoustic bass. Even the album’s most abrasive track, the whirring-and-clicking “Dance of Eyes,” is coated in gently-cascading synth, which blunts the prickliness of the rhythm. The tracks are layered and expansive; Billington avoids the temptation to cram every corner with sound. Instead, the bulk of the songs on   are built on simple, steady rhythms, over which Billington drapes electronic flourishes like tinsel. Ironically,   was born of personal upheaval; the album notes reference migraines and claustrophobia, and the album is meant to be read as a diary chronicling a particularly dark year in Billington’s life.

As Gidge, their field of expertise is electronica—specifically, the liminal space between ambient music and techno. Such music used to be umbilically linked to visions of futurism or modernity but, as with like-minded producers such as Christian Löffler or Ólafur Arnalds’ Kiasmos project, Gidge pursue something more in line with their immediate environment: a wintery, organic electronica that recalls the frosted forests they call home. LNLNN collects seven tracks, all new—sort of. The starting point for the LP was  , an album and film project made in conjunction with the production company Lamprey that explored the strange ambience of a cabin in which Stolterman was living, perched right on the edge of the wilderness. The result was desolate and atmospheric, but when they performed it live, Nilsson and Stolterman filled it out with new beats and textures, and soon it grew into a record in its own right. The result captures the eeriness and desolation of  , while adding a rhythmic quality that transforms and amplifies the material. “Eyes Open” and “White Curtains” wind mournful keys around beats sampled from struck wood and metal the pair scavenged from their wild surroundings. “Lit,” with its garage-y drums and haunted vocal, sounds like Burial transported to the edge of the Arctic Circle. But the album’s standout is “Midra,” where an unwavering, pulse-like rhythm winds through gusts of distortion and billowing, Enya-like vocals. It feels like a long walk through an icy wilderness, wrapped up warm in defiance of the elements. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/gidge-lnlnn-review"}

The first thing you hear on   is the sound of foaming waves, closely followed by a keyboard line that mimics the sound of a tropical pan flute.   follows a string of similarly coastal LPs— and its primary concern is not having any primary concerns. The two 15-minute compositions that make up the album drift by dreamlike, consisting of little more than ocean sounds and synths that ripple like the aurora borealis. Where his labelmates on the LA-based Not Not Fun bend and distend synths to create distinctly unsettling worlds, Wave Temples is more serene than surreal. But what makes   so engrossing is the way Wave Temples uses repeated patterns to hypnotizing effect. Nine minutes into “Part I,” the landscape suddenly shifts from a simple, two-note lullabye to what sounds like digital windchimes caught in a strong breeze. The tight cluster of notes repeats over and over, ocean roaring behind them, neither gaining nor losing strength. The net effect is weirdly calming, the twinkling keyboards becoming as regular and expected as the next heartbeat. “Part II” is even more translucent; the ocean keeps going, but the synth lines sound like they’re being played in a grotto far below. There are no sharp edges to the sounds on  ; everything is low and flutelike. The album ends with a simple, five-note melody plunked out on what sounds like a computerized kettle drum, the space between each note big enough to contain a whole other song.   doesn’t command attention or dazzle with complexity.

Decades later, Italian trio  are ramping classic country and rockabilly influences up to a frenzied, pace—fitting for a group whose name is apparently a homespun word that means “beautiful hysteria.” The band’s self-titled debut goes from soulful and harmony-driven (“River,” which sounds less like a song that was written than one that washed up on shore) to unapologetically badass (“Maybe Wrong”) to skittering and unhinged (“Let Me Down,” which sounds like a Riot Grrrl take on Cab Calloway). But it’s not just Kalahysteri’s country of origin that makes the trio special. The record could have been recorded in Brooklyn just as easily as Montebelluna, Italy. It’s the fact that the trio found this music, took it by the throat and squeezed: Kalahysteri’s is an urgent, big-tent brand of Americana, a small reminder that the U.S. can export more than just fear, and that what echoes back across the ocean is often a revelation. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/kalahysteri-self-titled-review"}

Like those bands, Heat have mastered the classic trick of dressing up pristine pop choruses in rain macs, fingerless gloves, and army boots so that they can convincingly bum cigs from the art kids after school. The aptly-titled   is a long, boozy odyssey through city streets after the bars have closed; there’s love—or, more accurately, lust—on the record, but the overriding sense is that all of these scenarios are playing out in the protagonist’s head as he trips from corner to corner under the pink streetlights. It’s closest in tone to the   episode “ ,” vocalist Susil Sharma rifling through past liaisons in his brain over the course of a single, blurry night. The lyrics, appropriately, evoke Verlaine—both Tom and Paul. There’s Jane the libertine, Buddha, Christ, and a “Joan of Arc of teenage lust,” all of which would land with a loud clang if they weren’t surrounded by sumptuous, black-velvet guitars and delivered in Sharma’s coolly detached, bored-lothario vocals. (Despite being born in New Brunswick and living in Canada, Sharma sounds impressively British throughout). Every song on   is immaculately constructed; big, pealing guitars kick out unapologetically melodic leads, basslines roam anxiously among thumping percussion, Sharma seethes and sneers; every element joins forces for soaring,   choruses. All of this sounds like a series of backhanded compliments, but it’s not:   stuns because every element is meticulously arranged to deliver maximum emotional impact. Wry verses explode into beaming refrains like a bitter cynic suddenly discovering true love. “The Unknown” opens with a clarion call of guitar and works its way into a chorus that struts and pouts with confidence. “Still, Soft” is almost entirely submerged in feedback, but the “doot-doot-doot” refrain bobbles its way cheerily to the top. And “Lush” is sewn up in sparkling spiderwebs of guitar, which gorgeously offset Sharma’s chiaroscuro vocal. By the end of  , Sharma has found his way out of the city and is walking along the beach, sun coming up, “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” floating above his head. It’s a surprisingly optimistic ending to a record that spends most of its time fusing pop immediacy with emotional distance.

It’s fitting because Baldi has always traded in propulsive, pound-the-steering wheel aggression.

Inspired by the discovery of  , a collection of obscure West African instrumentals from the 70’s, Anchorsong, who takes his name from Bjork’s 1993 “The Anchor Song,” emphasizes and incorporates complex rhythmic constructions and an expansive array of Afrobeat samples on  touching everything from surf rock to New Wave along the way. “Mother,” “Last Feast,” and “Butterfly,” which merge polyrhythmic structures with brief, indistinguishable vocal snippets and crisp house beats, are the perfect showcases for Yoshida’s Afro-house hybrids.

Landlady’s last LP, 2014’s  , was an energetic rock romp, but on their newest effort,   the Brooklyn ensemble is at its most polished, with sharper production and a brass section lending the songs extra muscle. Still, for all its instrumental flourishes,   doesn’t offer escapism from our noisy existence—instead, Landlady encourages emotional candor and a willingness to become radically vulnerable. Landlady starts off playing it cool. Opener “Electric Abdomen” is driven by rumbling percussion that gives way to flashy bursts of electric guitar. There are plenty of cheery moments on the record on the well—the playful “Driving in California” is one—but there’s an undercurrent of tension too, one that feels like a tacit admission that everything isn’t always rosy, even when you’re in love. “Nina,” for example, arrives as an adoring plea of devotion, with frontman Adam Schatz begging, “Nina, won’t you let me be your servant to your every breath?” He follows it with a drawn-out “Oh my God” that captures the dread, desperation, and delight of being in over your head. Restless drums toss and tumble behind guitar riffs that lurch and moan like an anxious stomach. And Schatz opens the record’s title track with an encouragement, singing “Go out of your way to be good in a world of pain/ Start at the top, then it bleeds on down the drain.” Fidgety little notes carry much of the song before a willfully unwieldy brass section joins in, sounding like a marching band heralding the end of the world. But even in the cacophony, the song doesn’t slip into doom and gloom. This approach seems to be Landlady’s songwriting sweet spot: feel happy, feel sad—just feel something. What Landlady delivers with   is a balm for the tumult of the human condition, an acknowledgement that we contain mutually inclusive multitudes that we’ll never fully untangle. The world is loud, chaotic, and increasingly terrifying, but it’s also a place where we can find wells of joy, humor, and affection.

Byrne’s musical takes on the hardships of love, the crossroads of change, and the uncertainty of decision-making were already honed and poignant, even then. , her follow-up, finds Byrne settled into a life in Brooklyn after years spent criss-crossing the country—Buffalo, Chicago, Seattle—and reflecting on the unresolved narratives that arose through years of transient living. While she seems to be tentatively embracing homesteading at the moment, the sweeping ambient soundscapes and lush, fingerpicked melodies of Not Even Happiness are an able device for working out the tension between her new stability and the piece of her spirit that still longs for the constant movement, could’ve-been loves, and starry roadside nights she’s left behind. In “Follow My Voice”, Byrne’s guitar thrums gently, but her low-range vocals are twisted by a lyrical love-hate relationship with a former home. “Melting Grid” is a wistful, harmonica-driven folk song in which Byrne reflects on the all-consuming loneliness of a life without roots. With strings weeping over mesmeric chord progressions, obvious standout “Natural Blue” is an ode to the fantasy of infinite freedom. When Byrne croons the words “When I first saw you/ The sky, it was such a natural blue,” it’s as if she’s fixing a mantra for herself to ensure she never forgets the strong connections between her emotional life and the natural world. In album closer “I Live Now As A Singer,” Byrne asks herself, “Tell me what it’s like to be here now.” Her battles with her restless heart against the strange appeal of stability resonates in a world where even the best-laid plans can be disrupted at a moment’s notice.  ’ gorgeous production and arrangements are just spare enough not to crowd out her earnest honesty.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/julie-byrne-not-even-happiness-review"}

Instead, they embrace the complexities of a full-on, grown-up existential crisis. “I’ve euthanized my youth,” guitarist and singer Kory Seal proclaims on opening track “Forever Poser,” setting the tone for what’s to come. Throughout the record, Thurst wrestle with dualities that never get resolved, and aren’t really meant to. They debate going out vs. staying in, judging vs. being judged, being cool vs. being yourself—i.e. uncool. The band employ few effects or overdubs, instead doubling down on their unvarnished quality without sacrificing fidelity. Seal’s voice is front and center, his words spittle-flecked and emphatic, with sister and drummer Jessie occasionally adding harmonies while holding down a solid backbeat. Where   had a more laid back, Feelies- type vibe, here the music recalls the post-punk pockets of ’90s indie, as well as the sad-sack parts of the Weezer discography. Though primarily an observational record,   isn’t afraid to go for the jugular when it counts. The lyrics take issue with complacency of any kind, saving a special irritation for complacency that’s cloaked in symbols of rebellion, like long hair (“Their unoriginality is starting to rub off on me”) or belligerent anti-government attitudes (“‘Fuck the government,/Somebody told me/That still counts as an excuse”). It’s also, at times, very funny, especially when Kory slides into the POV of someone he claims to hate in order to unleash a few biting “that’s so L.A.” bon mots: “Earlier in the song/ I was trying to express/Me and most fashion bloggers, we don’t get along.” Each song feels like a retort to the last. On “Electric Bill,” Kory bemoans his shut-in lifestyle with a crack about receiving a single phone call in a week (wrong number!) before diving into a drug-fueled bender on the very next track. He complains about living paycheck-to-paycheck, then follows it up with “Struggling Artist,” a flippant kiss-off to a bourgeois bohemian lifestyle that ends with the siblings harmonizing on the pointed rejoinder: “There’s no such thing as writer’s block/ if you’ve never come up with anything.” When his gaze turns inward on the searing, personal “Alienation”, Seal reacts with a shrug: “I try so hard to think of what I could possibly be but…I’m always just gonna be me.” By the time the album winds down with a short, spoken-word, boozy-party sequence (Weezer, remember?),  has lived up to its title. Though it will surely rattle some cages, this record will play well with listeners who relate to the old adage, “If you haven’t got anything nice to say about anybody, come sit by me.” —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/thrust-cut-to-the-chafe-review"}

Part of that is because of the gentrification process that’s squeezing so many out of rent they were once able to afford. But, also—growing up in and around the nation’s capital exerts a strange and particular pressure. The industry in D.C. is pretty much purely politics and its associated supports (universities included), and as such can feel suffocating.

Channels is comprised of three individuals who know this peculiar world intimately—the notorious   ( , Burning Airlines, many production and engineering credits) and bassist Janet Morgan (of  , also Robbins’ wife), who currently live in Baltimore, and drummer Darren Zentek ( ,  ), who is still in D.C. proper. And so, their anti-Trump Inauguration protest 7-inch, “Backpfeifengesicht/Airstrip One,” feels more natural and less opportunistic than many other political statements. Even when addressing entirely personal matters, and even in the poetic, playful lyrical abstractions with which Robbins often works, there’s politics in the water. “Backpfeifengesicht”—a word which can be translated from the German as “a face in need of a slap”—is as direct an indictment of Trump as possible. It goes from the sort of roiling, percussive noise rock this crew is known for (dual vocals from Robbins and Morgan urgent, overlapping) to chiming pop luxury at the flip of a dime, seeking the humanity of a man with seemingly no empathy. “Airstrip One,” a tense little jam that works expertly with post-punk negative space (particularly when it comes to Morgan’s vocal lines), locates the terror of losing ground that exists at the heart of xenophobia, fascism, and nationalism (“Who was holding all the gold in that Golden Age?”). It asks of those it critiques: “Were you fighting for the right side? Did you throw away your lifeline? Did you wake up on the wrong side of a burning bed?” As Robbins repeats those words, and as the song sharpens into punk glass, there is honest passion and power in his voice—grit, if you will. Resolve. “Backpfeifengesicht/Airstrip One” is also the first new Channels material in a decade; adult responsibilities, including complicated healthcare for Robbins and Morgan’s son Callum, who was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, made bringing the group together regularly too challenging for a time. There is an ease to these two complicated, coiled-up songs, a sort of effervescence that pushes through even in the most pointed moments; the band is obviously having a   playing with one another. This is reportedly only the first new material from Channels’ second life, and hallelujah for that.

His collaborators have included everyone from the late   to Daft Punk and Paul McCartney, and they’re not even part of his absolutely massive workload in 2016, when he earned credits on some of the year’s biggest records—Kaytranada’s   and Esperanza Spalding’s  —while also producing an entire album for rapper Common.

It’s a realm reserved for producers like Riggins and his contemporaries. They’re constantly searching for the next sample to chop, the right drum beat, the perfect bassline. And in doing so, Riggins has crafted vignettes (the Common-sampling “Keep It On,” and Dilla-referencing “Never Come Close”) and fully-realized moments (the moving “Suite Poetry” featuring poet  , and video game-blazed “Crystal Stairs”).

They’re no less political on  , their first full-length, but in the time since   they’ve both added a member and become more sophisticated in tone. It was a wise move; while   ‘shouty-dancey’ approach plays well with the converted, a pointed message packs greater punch when delivered in a way that invites close listening.   is dense and meticulous, balancing melodic hooks with slinkier passages so skillfully that it’s easy to get lost in the music before realizing you’re grooving to a song about AK-47s. The album telegraphs some of its intentions in its cover art, a neon pastiche of a solitary eye peering out over an endless stretch of oil wells and telephone lines. It’s like a Lisa Frank illustration of Fitzgerald’s Valley of Ashes in  . In Pollen RX’s songs, the world is baked by the sun, frozen by air conditioning, patrolled by authorities, populated by pre-fab housing and, on opening track “Billboard Promises,” full of ads offering relief in the form of lotto winnings and sleeping pills.   is about what happens when a country exhausts its resources (“Sand in the Well.”) “Sunbelt emptiness/ American design,” Maud Morgan sings on the title track; according to PollenRX, this national vacuum is no accident. To put it another way: it’s not a bug, it’s a feature. However dystopian the lyrics, the music remains bright, bouncy, and catchy. Propulsive pop number  “Again” is about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion; on the aforementioned title track, co-vocalists Morgan and Ben Hirsch alternate between high-register yelping and gravelly growls while darkly juxtaposing the plasticity of reality TV with flickering images of environmental disasters. Consumerism, both its temptations and its disappointments, is another prime target: “Packaging” (which first appeared on  ) is a whip-smart critique of brand-as-narrative that bares its fangs in the chorus: “Here’s a story/ See if you can sell it/ Truth is nothing /packaging is everything.” Despite their dissatisfaction with the world around them, Pollen RX is still able to find light in the cracks. “Paper plates on the kitchen floor/ but I adore you,” sings Morgan sweetly on “Apartment,” a song that’s heartbreaking in its elucidation of how small dreams can shrink, but still have meaning. By the time the album winds down with the dream-like “Control,” the band has found a kind of peace in their environment: “The sand and the sun and you all alone.” For all their vitriol, Pollen RX have no illusions about their own complicity in the evils they attack. On   they indict themselves in the sad and often violent processes that make the modern way of life possible as often as they do the listener.

It’s recorded and mastered evenly and professionally, as would be expected from an official release, but there’s nothing about it that sounds sterile. You can hear Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein moving to and away from their microphones, and there are some very natural moments, as when Tucker struggles to get all her lyrics in without losing any ferocity on “What’s Mine is Yours,” a breathless ode to love as subversive energy from 2005’s  , which sounds far more vital here than its studio version. Both her and Brownstein’s voices have ragged edges by the time they get to the blown-out bridge. Janet Weiss’ performance throughout the entire record should silence any rogue naysayers who don’t think she’s one of America’s best rock drummers—powerful and precise, Weiss keeps up a pace that’d have most gasping midway through the set, injecting the occasional sly, jazzy curlicue or syncopated part with fluid ease.

The setlist is pretty evenly divided throughout their discography—several tracks from  , and  , as well as a smattering of nostalgic selections from  ,  , and a stunning version of “Start Together,” from 1999’s  . It serves just as easily as a terrific introduction to Sleater-Kinney’s discography and ethos as it does as a treat for longtime fans.

After a trio of independently-released ethereal folk records, Showalter took bold first steps to transition Strand of Oaks from a hushed whisper to full-on scream. Enlivened by stadium-style arrangements and thunderous guitar heroics, Showalter used   to stare down his demons with unbridled energy and a brutally honest lyrical approach. “I know you cheated on me,” he sang on the title track, “but I cheated on myself.” Showalter explores that forthright, lionhearted approach to storytelling even further on  . Equally inspired by Creation Records, Trojan dub compilations, and Jane’s Addiction, Showalter turned to producer Nicolas Vern (The War on Drugs, Spoon) and best friend/guitarist Jason Anderson to help combine those disparate influences into a cohesive body of work. Together they achieve a loose, hedonistic vibe. With strident, sing-along style vocals and unrelenting solos, second single “Rest of It” nods toward multiple musical genres without feeling forced or dilettantish. The songs on   grapple equally with domestic issues, the near-death of his brother and, and his own impermanence, but instead of unraveling, Showalter chooses to celebrate his limited time on earth through rock and roll. The fuzzed out, synth-driven single “Radio Kids” bottles the pure teenage bliss that comes with hearing your favorite song on the FM waves, giving you a fleeting sense of courage and peace. Downtempo piano-ballad “Cry” pinpoints the devastating moment you realize that it’s you, not your partner, who are the source of the turmoil in your relationship. Frustration—with love, with family, with aging—crop up throughout the record, and Showalter speaks about them in matter-of-fact language. “You went away, you went searching” he sings at the start of the record, “You came back tired of looking.” If there were times on   where Showalter sounded lost, on  , he’s beginning to take control of his own life. Though it’s somber at times, the record is shot through with an underlying spirit of hope. Self-deprecation is replaced with honest contemplation, and whatever demons haunted   have been put to rest. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/strand-of-oaks-hard-love-review"}

But his new record marks a first; the rapping on  —fluid, dynamic and above all, thoughtful—finally matches the pull and urgency of his production. In the past, a solemn chorus of horns and bass, like the one on   opener “Digging Deep,” may have outstripped the lyrical overlay. Here, though, the music provides a backdrop for Oddisee to explain the album’s premise: Our actions are only comprehensible once you understand the circumstances that have shaped our respective characters.  zeroes in on those circumstances, while serving up another selection of near-perfect beats. On the clear standout, “You Grew Up,” one verse traces the divergent paths of Oddisee and a white friend who grows up to become a murderous police officer; another examines a man whose self-loathing leads him to radical Islam. Oddisee offers a complex portrait of both men, and his storytelling is complemented by sharp lyrical asides. The producer places himself under the microscope as well: The go-go beat on “NNGE” affords him an opportunity to return to his D.C. roots, while on “Rain Dance,” he explains how his ambitions as a musician confounded his Sudanese father. The parental pressure led him to focus on his finances. Oddisee’s focus on the business of his art led him to analyze the weaknesses of independent hip-hop as a whole.  , he explained his takeaways—“We rap about rapping, we chastise, we preach, we live in the past”—and said that he had challenged himself to do better.

By the early 1960s, the contentious struggle for freedom had erupted into an all-out war for national independence. By 1975, the Cape Verde islands and Guinea-Bissau were free from Portuguese rule, embarking on the long journey of post-colonial reformation. Throughout the next decade and a half, the cultural life of the Cape Verdean islands exploded, giving birth to a number of bands who took the islands’ traditional/indigenous styles and fused them with Portuguese fado (the folk music of Portugal’s urban poor and working class), while also taking influences from the rock and R&B sounds that had been coming over from the States. This eclectic mixture of musical ingredients helped produce a dynamic music community that would carry the spirit of the Cape Verde islands around the world. , the latest compilation from New York-based reissue label Ostinato Records, explores the broad range of electrifying music that blossomed up from this small cluster of islands. Primarily consisting of guitar-and-keyboard-driven, uptempo dance music, the tracks have strong stylistic resemblances to other musical styles of the Afro-Atlantic diaspora, most notably zouk music—as well as Trinidadian soca and the bachata music of the Dominican Republic. It’s a bit different from  ’s  —more dancefloor-oriented and less psychedelic—but they’re clearly two essential peas in a pod. America Brito’s catchy and celebratory “Babylon 79” features a nimble, pulsating rhythm section a sing-songy chorus and oddly phased/flanged keyboard chords that infuse the high energy dance tune with an odd, nearly psychedelic edge. The tracks are rich with colorful instrumentation. Tulipa Negra’s masterful “Corpo Limpo” rides atop a heavy, insistent groove, while the guitar deftly comps in the background, the dynamic vocals intertwine with a cheesy but absolutely perfect toy synth/organ. Throughout the compilation’s 18 tracks, the songs of unheralded acts such as Jose Casimiro, Pedrinho and Tam Tam 2000 stand out as examples of the bright, optimistic sound of the Cape Verdean people.

Back then, the combo cleaved toward an inside-out strain of post-bop, but in the years since—in duo, trio, and quartet configurations–its music has embraced a fierce sense of freedom, even within hypnotic, circular forms. These days, Mazurek and Taylor work most often as a  , where meticulously deployed electronics usually provide a muscular skeleton for the hornman’s powerful yet lyric improvisation. In April of 2016, the Duo was performing at Café Oto in London—its first visit to the city in a decade—and for part of the stint the pair invited two powerful locals to join them. Bassist John Edwards has been a fixture on the UK improv scene for decades—he’s recently contributed some of his strongest playing to groups led by German saxophonist  —while pianist Alexander Hawkins is one of the country’s brightest young talents, already involved in strong partnerships with free improv sax legend Evan Parker and the legendary South African drummer  . Their involvement on the four extended pieces featured on   pushed the Chicago Underground out of its recent modus operandi toward a raw sort of spiritual seeking, where Mazurek’s innate melodic gifts—still deeply informed by the tart playfulness of Don Cherry—regularly collide with the thrumming energy and spacious flow of his collaborators. As usual, Taylor provides an imperturbable pulse, driving the music with unerring instincts that accommodate Edwards’ fiery arco lines and furious plucking—which on a piece like “Something Must Happen” veer toward a viscous, grinding low-end a la William Parker—and Hawkins’ hammering, skittering notes, without losing a sense of movement. He’s one of the subtlest drummers in jazz—a player possessed with faultless time who can operate in the most blustery setting without pushing his partners to the side. Mazurek is at is his best here, uncorking epic solos built from short, indelible phrases scattered across the vast landscapes of these spontaneous creations. On several pieces he adds wordless vocals, tapping into an early ‘70s spiritual jazz vibe, albeit with a much coarser, immediate energy. Only “Boss Redux” draws on some previously composed material—it features some reworked music from the Duo’s 2014 album  —but still, the foursome serves up roiling, in-the-moment energy.

Bedwetter is candid about his strained mental health, and the mood transitions abruptly: on “fondly eulogizing sleep,” bedwetter displays exceptional skill at composing brooding instrumental suites before the negative vibes take over again. Just when you think things can’t get more bleak (the pinnacle is the funereal “square movement”), Miller dives deeper, cannibalizing his psyche on “Haze of Interference,” screaming “Are you happy, Travis?” The album rewards fans of Lil Ugly Mane’s Memphis-nostalgic production, and new listeners will be riveted by Miller’s nihilistic lyrics. The violence is not projected onto society, but rather the self, revealing an emotional core often absent from the macho rap music scene.

Malek worked as a film composer, and served as the conductor of the Algerian Television Orchestra for decades. Last year, the German imprint Habibi Funk    , a collection of some of Malek’s soundtrack work. It was during the creation of that compilation, while digging through Malek’s archive, that the label happened upon a cache of cassette tapes containing Malek’s experiments with a battery of early synthesizers, drum machines, and field recordings. Malek, who passed away in 2008, left little documentation about  the purpose of these loose, exploratory pieces. There’s speculation that some of them might have been used for an avant-garde festival in Cuba that he traveled to in the early ‘80s, but there are no photos to reveal what keyboards he was using, or who else might be playing on them. Their origins will forever remain shrouded in mystery. Even those enamored by Malek’s compositions and arrangements on   will be startled by the otherworldly tones on  . Few of the tracks here top three minutes, but there’s a density and wildness to the ideas explored in those brief bursts. “Tape 9 (Part 4)” moves from Riley-esque loops to INA-GRM clatter to fidgety arpeggios. “Tape 22 Track 2” does New Age soundscapes with gentle washes and trickles of water. “Tape 9 (Part 1)” mashes together folk strings, recordings from a bazaar and crazed circuitry while “Tape 16 Track 3” undulates like one of Popul Vuh’s soundtracks for Werner Herzog. At their root, these tapes reflect the sensibilities of European synth explorers of the same era, with touches of Cluster, Terry Riley, Klaus Schulze and the Berlin School bubbling up throughout. And while none of these Malek pieces are specifically designed to accompany a film, they nevertheless make for a thrilling imaginary soundtrack. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ahmed-malek-flako-the-electronic-tapes-review"}

The trio—singer-bassist Dylan England, singer-bassist Zack Schoedel and drummer Greg McClure—often center their narratives in the brutal isolation of upstate New York. “Honey, you ought to leave your phone on when you leave Fredonia,” England implores in the opening to “Wrong Distance,” using his artful vocal phrasing to make the words “phone on” rhyme with the name of the college town. The brutal weather of the group’s Buffalo, NY home is often used as a metaphor for spiritual loneliness. “Buried under the covers/Buried under the years like the others,” a snowed-in England sings halfway through the record. Occasionally,  ventures outside the standard guitar/bass/drums formula to thrilling result. “Coast to Coast AM,” an ambient two-minute song that features programmed drums and a single repeated refrain, draws its power from minimalism. But what remains clear throughout the record is that the group’s greatest strength lies in their ability to wring deep feeling out of simple wordplay. “You taste like fall/ Cold and desperate and alcohol/ I fall,” England sings on “Loose Leaf,” the album’s emotional centerpiece.

A former bandmate of Jose Gonzales, Wästberg inhabits all corners of his records; he plays all the drums, basses, keyboards, guitars, clarinets, and saxophones himself before chopping them into hypnotic tracks that bridge the gap between folk and ambient. It’s a master class at combining elements that wouldn’t work together in any other context—from the forlorn bagpipes mixed into “A Minor Life,” to Wästberg’s staccato vocal delivery on album opener “In the Mist.” (The latter, when coupled with the track’s driving bass line, has a distinct hip-hop influence.) But it’s the rhythmic experimentation that truly elevates  . It ranges from the mid-tempo shuffle of “In the Mist” to the piano and hand-clap created backbeat of “Revoke.” There’s even a hint of pan-African rhythms on “Leave it Here,” a sonic souvenir from the Swede’s time at the University of Kwasulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. Be warned: It’ll take a few passes to fully unpack the album. An arresting release that’s equal parts street grit and John Cage/art house fantasy,  sees Wästberg happily sifting through his influences. He’s constructed a sonically complex world, full of rewarding creative moments and hard-to-pinpoint emotions.

But these songs are so exuberant, and Charles’ voice is so defiant and confident, that it hardly registers that way. Charles’ 2010 EP   demonstrated that the Edmonton singer wasn’t content to stay within the parameters of retro soul—the G-funk-influenced “Parkdale,” in particular, demonstrated her eagerness to cover fresh ground—and  continues that imaginative streak, yet often in subtler ways. Charles constructed these songs with a series of producers, including the Drake collaborator Slakah the Beatchild, and as a result  presents itself as a grab-bag of surprises. The short “Intro,” with its modulated voices and effects, provides a thrilling launch pad into the thumping title track, while “Two Steps” leans on an unexpected and glimmering Afrobeat guitar riff. Both “Endless Chain” and “Money” evoke vintage Muscle Shoals recordings, but with an emphasis on precise and booming percussion that keeps them fresh and modern. These varied styles give Charles different contexts to experiment with her vocal gymnastics. Throughout the album, she pays homage to legends like Aretha Franklin and Etta James—on “Sweet Memories,” she does an uncanny take on the Jackson 5’s shrill howls—but she’s got a sense of spunk that’s all her own. From start to finish,  serves up one kiss-off after another to Charles’ ex. At one point she insists that she “don’t need a man to walk me home,” and by the album’s conclusion she declares, definitively, “I won’t be back.” But because she manages to channel her angst in a way that sounds more playful than bitter or mournful, Tanika Charles makes it clear that she’s moving forward.

In fact, even tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby—one of the most loquacious soloists in jazz—reels it in, frequently adding to the rhythmic fabric as much as he elucidates melody. Although Overseas is most certainly a modern jazz combo, the way the record was mixed and the arrangements often suggest a more rock-oriented sound—the tautness of ‘70s post-punk. In press materials for the record the bassist says, “My music doesn’t really sound like Talking Heads or the B-52s, but I listened to a lot of that on the road lately, so the sound and sensibility seeped into my writing.” Indeed, from the opening bars of “I’m Up on This Step,” a slithering, funky marvel of polymetric precision, the groove is shaped by a number of overlapping patterns: a jagged guitar line by  , a stuttering beat from Kenny Wollesen, interlocked, cascading figures by Malaby and keyboardist Jacob Sacks, and the leader’s pumping pizzicato bass. As the tune hits full steam, it seems to unravel into abstraction, with all of the instruments engaging in a feather-light dance as they slowly disengage. “Extraterrestrial Tantrum” percolates inside an ambient glow, opening with rudimentary drum machine, elegant piano chords, and texture-rich guitar and saxophone tones that coalesce into one lovely cloud of sound, while Opsvik offers plaintive arco sobs, drifting into the din. “Brraps!” deploys a heavy funk vibe, with Seabrook channeling Nile Rodgers while the leader virtually sings with his bow; Malaby and Opsvik eventually trade 12-bar solos, demonstrating the lean efficiency at work throughout. “First Challenge on the Road” shows how the group can do a lot with a little, as the bulk of its substance is a repetitive, motorik coda where the guitarist subtly unleashes a constantly shifting series of galloping chords. The energy and timbre of the music could produce clumsy fusion in the wrong hands, but this band masterfully balances power and subtlety, highlighting its time-tested rapport by shaving away all that’s extraneous.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/eivind-opsvik-overseas-v-review"}

It’s easy to speculate that the supernatural tightness of those groups has something to do with “family bonds,” but it’s also worth noting that, over time, a lot of those sibling bands of the ’60s ended up getting really weird. Not as weird, perhaps, as  , the tough-to-pronounce and tougher-to-categorize brotherly psych-rock duo originally from Orlando, Florida. On the band’s new album,  , Tonstartsshbandht prove themselves a contortionistic outfit capable of impressive shifts in tone and musical approach. In just three songs, Andy and Edwin White meld Can’s propulsive math-rock with summery guitar licks worthy of Shuggie Otis (“Breathe”); deep-dive into acid-soaked southern rock (“Sorcerer”), and indulge in a skittering punk opera with drumming and elastic vocal harmonies that evoke The Who (“Opening”). This is, technically, the band’s first studio album since 2011—even if a decade’s worth of demos and live recordings paved its way. While Tonstartsshbandht takes full advantage of their newfound studio setting, the duo’s Southern roots—the band has been based in New York City for years now—bubble to the surface in a congenial looseness that belies spooky psychic myths about “family bands.” The fact that two players can pack this much sound and style into three songs is the minor miracle here. —", "genre": ["Rock", "experimental rock", "psychedelic rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/tonstartssbandht-sorcerer-review"}

One of them is full of freaked-out, bug-eyed punk rock—like Devo on a sugar high—and the other is a collection of sun-warped folk, country, and religious music (!). Some of this sonic whipsawing is a result of the DNA: it’s a combination of the group’s early tape-only recordings and newer, more aggressive work. Taken together on  , they function as an accidental mirror of our present age, one characterized by uneasiness, uncertainty and moments of full-on, body-wracking panic. It’s that last emotion that comes through clearest on  . Album opener “Heaven is In My Head” operates at 600 miles per hour, Laurel Horrell’s rubberband voice stretched taut over guitars that pummel like light artillery fire. Though slower, “Won’t Forget to Die,” which follows, is no less freaked out. Playing like a kind of LSD-doused minimalist country song, “Die” opens with a dead-eyed Horrell declaring, “First you feel its breath/ then you feel its sting/ and when it’s finally over/ you won’t feel a thing.” The song rides the same descending four-note slide guitar line over and over as a violins groans like the broken front door of a haunted house in the background. From there, the album more or less follows the old Hollywood dictum of “One for them, one for me”—one blistering, crowd-pleasing rave-up followed by an excursion into open-ended psychedelia. The lo-fi stomper “Thing” is followed by the chilling “Blood Chant,” a weirdo cultish singalong in which the group sings their own name Hare Krishna-like over rattling tambourines and loose acoustic strumming. On  , both halves of a disheveled whole work perfectly; the adrenalized charge that comes from the synth-punk rave-up “Cold Foreign Advisor” is no less satisfying than the psychotic children’s-song see-saw of “Parasite Inside.” They even work wonders when they’re playing it relatively straight: “I’m Lit” has the dirt-under-the-nails grit and leather-pants swagger of early Stooges, but is lit up by a pinwheeling keyboard line. Ultimately, the group’s stylistic grab-bag is a perfect reflection of the album’s unspoken—but deeply felt—theme: if the doomsday clock is accelerating its race to zero, you may as well try to do as many things as you can before the bell tolls. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/aquarian-blood-last-nite-in-paradise-review"}

Throughout  , comedian Catherine Cohen and singer/guitarist Jeanette Wall (aka the surprisingly Googleable Band Practice) ride a wave of giddy, nervous energy. The applause is enthusiastic but sparse. The mood is loose and friendly, raw and real. It’s not lo-fi, but it is distinctly, proudly no-frills. Wall goes first, juxtaposing her dry one-liners with vulnerable asides and disarmingly sincere love songs. The unsettlingly pretty “Freddy” imagines romance on Elm Street. “Put Up a Fight” is a peppy little anthem for adorable fuckups. “I want to get real lost,” she sings over a casually strummed guitar on the brooding standout track “I Wanna Die Like Elvis.” “I’m gonna make you love me and see how much it costs.” Wall’s style is charmingly funny, genuine, defiant, and coy—all at once. Wall introduces Cohen by saying things are about to get weird, and she’s not wrong. “I’m fun, I’m chill, I’m a guy’s girl,” Cohen says before unleashing a laugh that teeters on goat-ish. “I say that because I have a tilted uterus.” What does that mean? No idea. But it works. Cohen’s comedy moves quickly, sometimes switching from millennial NYC vapidity to absurd non sequiturs so quickly your mind may start trying to connect dots that aren’t there. “I keep doing this weird thing where I forget that nothing matters,” she says early on, and that’s pretty much her in a nutshell. —", "genre": ["Comedy", "indie", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/band-practice-catherine-cohen-friends-live-1-review"}

It recalls some of the key themes of early post-punk; if punk stripped away all the fuss and pomp of ‘70s rock to its bare essentials and set it at warp speed, post-punk bands drilled further down into the dark core of psychedelia, to all the bad drugs and isolating cults beneath the swirling colors. “Attic” is rickety in that same way, with a woozy synth line and Eva Hannan’s spiraling vocals taking us up there. It brings back the childhood dread of seeing that unstable little ladder pop down from the ceiling at a relative’s house:  This is the territory that Rays explore—though you shouldn’t expect any of those secrets to be made explicit over the course of these 11 songs. Where punk can be didactic, post-punk works best with lyrical bones, letting the listeners, like forensic specialists, follow the story back themselves through clues that might not seem obvious at first. Rays, of course, know punk and post-punk so intimately these tropes are second nature to them: Hannan, Stanley Martinez, Alexa Pantalone and Troy Hewitt have been/are in more excellent bands than one can count (Pang, The World,  , Life Stinks, and so forth), and they genuinely sound like they’re having a good time with one another here. That’s especially evident when they’re working with the existential dread of everyday life, as on “Attic”; other tracks in that vein, like “Drop Dead” and “Pain and Sorrow,” sound positively ebullient in much the manner of the best Fall songs, curdled with wicked delight. Master engineer Mikey Young (of  ,  , etc.) brings this quality out perfectly; the album sounds, essentially, like a well-recorded live performance, rather than an airless studio artifact. Rays’ debut is, thus, a very good document of a very good band, and its restraint is part of what makes it special. This isn’t a band that could come out of the gate hard; these songs work so well because they hang together so laconically, belying the tension beneath. If they went full bore, they’d fall apart. These songs’ subtle construction and delicate equilibrium are necessary.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/rays-rays-review"}

That’s part of its elegance and efficacy, as much as its range is. But it’s also catchy, and well-constructed in terms of pure songwriting, and while there’s no room for mistakes, she makes none.

Aside from deeply influential acts like Severed Heads, much of that era’s gems have languished outside of popular memory, at best graduating from tiny tape runs to obscure internet uploads. Aussie reissue label Efficient Space excavates 10 such lost wonders on the new compilation  , curated by Sydney-born DJ Steele Bonus. Though united in their unpolished, DIY vibe, the selections cover a wide range of sounds. Some are disturbingly dark (the engrossing bass throb of Prod’s “Knife on Top”; the jarring, competing layers of The Horse He’s Sick’s industrial-edged “Larynx”). Others are almost contagiously bright, like Moral Fibro’s bossa nova-kissed “Take a Walk in the Sun” and Zerox Dreamflesh’s dubby instrumental “Squids Can Fly.” Of them all, the gleefully sacrilegious “Jesus Krist Klap Rap (Orthodox Mix)” from MK Ultra & The Assassins of Light is the most immediately danceable. Irena Xero’s punch-drunk “Lady on the Train” and He Dark Age’s itchy “Holding Out For Eden” feel like fever-dreams, while the previously-unreleased “Will I Dream?” by Andy Rantzen (half of seminal Aussie techno duo Itch-E & Scratch-E) has a frazzled, mechanistic hypnotism. Meanwhile, Software Seduction’s squiggly slow burn “New Collision” and Ironing Music’s twinkling “Don’t Wish it Away” seem to anticipate the likes of Stereolab and Broadcast. The result of a diverse scene that extended to zines, visual art, and beyond,   is a valuable invitation to explore these and other overlooked outliers of the time. Many of the artists featured here are still at it—among them,   and   . Both then and now, they emerge as misfits seizing the means of production—via affordable synths, drum machines and cassette duplication—and bending it to their will. —", "genre": ["Electronic", "post-punk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-oz-waves-review"}

Though these songs play with a variety of electronic styles—dance, dream pop, new wave, dance punk, and Italo disco—the album finds the band carving a consistent niche in the ever-expanding world of synth pop. Icy synthetics collide with beachy melodies, shaping an environment that’s both sweaty and chilling. “Mysteries,” an electro-dance delight, sounds like the band is performing at a discotheque cut into a glacier, with candy-colored lights refracting through the crystal and into a purple sky.  allows Sims to slip into a series of characters, turning each song into a vignette that captures her versatility as a performer. On the album’s second track, “Brat,” Sims embodies a glutton without abandon, taking the world for all its worth over a booming Italo disco beat. “I live a life of vice and convenience,” she boasts convincingly. “I live my life in front of the aperture.” Later, on “Swimming,” she’s pleading with a lover to let their tryst continue, while the instrumentals lay a spacious groove. “Stay with me forever/Something in the air that feels so right.” On “All of the Punks,” the album’s most exciting track, Sims synthesizes potent agoraphobia into a banging DFA jam. She sings in a whispered deadpan while the composition swirls in the background, leading to a disorienting combo—almost like being at the club while a panic attack sets in. While the themes of Perfect   never cut too deep, the opportunity to experience someone else’s created world is enough to relieve the pressure of reality, if even for a little bit. —", "genre": ["Pop", "dream pop", "Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/furniteur-perfect-lavender-review"}

The quartet’s more crowd-pleasing songs, like “Don’t Touch Anything” and “Baby Boy,” have become occasions for joyous basement singalongs across the country, for crowds to recognize a shared love. No longer content with this endless cycle of writing and touring, Pile’s principal songwriter Rick Maguire  . The result of this creative respite and reflection is  , an album weighted heavily by Maguire’s bucolic surroundings and his self-imposed solitude. Historically, Pile’s LPs have never had much of a central theme. But on  , the thirteen tracks are connected by a clear thread of consternation. “Leaning on a Wheel” displays a prickly restlessness in its flirtation with Americana and acrimony. “So play in traffic/ Have a kid/ And may every good deed be in self-interest” is a statement charged with resentment. Leading with cutthroat strings under percussionist Kris Kuss’s simmering drumroll, “Rope’s Length” evokes an unsettling disconnect. When we reach the chorus “But I want it at rope’s length/ If I’m not being used”, the song’s protagonist is already proverbially lost at sea. Pile have always been masters of askew chord progressions, and on   these riffs pair with lyrical brooding to add an extra layer of tension. The sense of chagrin that’s woven into   goes beyond bellowing and bombast. “Making Eyes,” with its reluctant piano and lumbering tempo, contributes to the song’s theme of cloistered paranoia. As expected, Pile still manage to get in some bruisers like “Texas” that take the reins off of the rhythm section and let dual guitars tangle for some raucous jousting. Bitter sentiment and churning cadence merge on “Dogs,” a pitter-patting of tender chords steadily swelling into an orchestral thunderstorm. Mustering all his spite, Maguire finally cuts loose: “Then I pretend to sleep alone/ I’d rather on the ground than in your bed/ I’ll sleep on the lawn or stay up instead.” For a band that has been so closely tied to its homebase,   is a powerful album driven by anxiety and separation.", "genre": ["Rock", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/pile-a-hairshirt-of-purpose-review"}

On “Final Eclipse,” in particular, the crew assembles a steady 4/4 beat that grows more turbulent as it unfolds. Near the four-minute mark, Hallett and Hutchings inject squealing horns and gushing drums into the mix, pushing the song to its euphoric peak. It’s not only the EP’s best song, it best epitomizes the record’s disparate ambience: the existential dread and the joy of surrender. The EP conceives of death the same as Flying Lotus’ 2014 LP,  , which also viewed extinction as a bright journey to the afterlife. “We see death as the first stage of rebirth,” goes a line from The Comet’s  . “A chance for new ideas, sounds and ways of interacting to grow.” In a way then,   isn’t just about literal destruction; it conceptualizes life after the apocalypse, when the world we’ve known is gone, and it’s time to create new political, social, and economic structures.

As suggested by its moonlit album art, this is a record that reaches for the stars rather than the pavement, often pushing its post-metal experiments well past the six-minute mark. Bannon also knows when to let other musicians shine, as evidenced by a solid backing band that includes Ballou and heavy hitters who have logged hours with The Red Chord (guitarist Mike McKenzie), Coliseum (drummer Chris Maggio), and Hatebreed (guitarist Sean Martin).

In fact, “I thought we’d give it up,” Oldham said of he and his group’s work. We’re glad they saw this through.  surveys a wide swath of Haggard’s discography, with a pointed emphasis on lesser-known material. There are a number of tunes here that Haggard didn’t write—Blaze Foley’s “If I Could Only Fly” or the Jimmie Davis classic “Nobody’s Darlin’ But Mine” (the title is simplified to “Nobody’s Darling” on  )—but they help fill in a portrait that Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy paints, indicating the breadth and poetic sensibility of the country great. He leads a fantastic band, roomy enough to touch on Haggard’s broad curiosity as a true purveyor of Americana—a guy who made records paying tribute to the music of Western swing-heavy Bob Wills and Texas troubadour Jimmie Rodgers—including airy saxophone and flute lines prominently featured in the arrangements. Guest guitarist A.J. Roach beautifully takes the lead on “The Day the Rains Came” and flutist Nuala Kennedy offers tender contributions to “Some of Us Fly.” The arrangements reach toward a cosmic strain of honky-tonk with a loose, swinging rhythmic feel shaped by drummer Van Campbell and bassist Danny Kiely that feels warmly lived-in, allowing the band enough space to chime in with instrumental asides—particularly from fiddler Cheyenne Mize and fellow guitarist Chris Rodahaffer. It’s hard not to sense the affinity Oldham felt for Haggard, a guy who bent the rules of Nashville to suit his own quirks for more than five decades. But ultimately, it’s the songs themselves and the singular soul Haggard imparted to them that provides the inspiration for this homage, an effort that celebrates its subject through Oldham’s stubborn originality.

Their minimal instrumentation—just a guitar and bass—emphasized vulnerability, bolstering the impact of their interlocking voices. On  they’ve subtly shifted gears, opting for songs that are alternately calm and cutting. Sonically, Tucker and Tividad are still experimenting. They introduce drums on this album, but the transition isn’t jarring. Drummer Miles Wintner is a patient, measured player, who allows them to harvest elements of ’90s rock they couldn’t have explored without a backbeat. His serene rhythms smooth out slowcore jaunts like “Sleepless” and “Your Heart,” which adopt leisurely tempos and a lethargic cadence. Girlpool makes sharp turns into noise-rock on tracks like “Corner Store,” where a jangly, sanguine melody suddenly gives way to messy distortion. Other times, the duo gleefully employs swirling guitars (“She Goes By”), bass flourishes (“High Rise”), and bright, plinking piano chords (“Powerplant”). Lyrically,   often nods to adolescence—the narrator of one song holds a jar of change, makes a mess on a kitchen counter, and carries crumbs in her pocket—but it gradually twists into bleaker terrain, offering grimy visions of industrial America. They consider lost innocence on “Soup,” an eerie, slow-moving song about a teenage addict; they make quips about climate change on the dream-pop slow burn “It Gets More Blue.” Later, they’re tackling much bigger fish: On “Static Somewhere,” they weave together wry metaphors about losing yourself in modern vices; the title track grapples with the inevitability of a drone-powered future. The album ends with optimistic longing to find a way out of the mindless landscape: “I hope I’ll find you / Static somewhere.” It’s Tucker and Tividad’s quiet refusal to shy away from darkness that allows them to persevere through the noise. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/girlpool-powerplant-review"}

In Vrebalov’s “Bubbles,” a line from a poem written by Robert Creeley and John Cage—“Then what is emptiness for”—is voiced by a lone soprano, between moments of animalistic cacophony and urgent chanting. The noise soon gives way to resonant bells and a glistening chorus. The album closes with Parry’s brazen anthem “Their Passing in Time,” which, in the beginning, trembles with solemn minor-key sopranos singing, “With the passing of time …” At first, the line is delivered in solo; then two, then several voices, framed in “ah-ah-ahhhhs,” droning hums and dirge-like strings, join in just past the halfway mark.

Before the major labels caught on and launched them to multiplatinum success, they were signed to Sub Pop, and then to Greg Ginn’s SST Records for debut full-length  . Even on that punk-driven indie label, Soundgarden was a square peg. Guitarist Kim Thayil had become an Iommi-worshiping conjurer of detuned, sludgy blues—punk in ethos, but far more of a metalhead in style. Thayil gave the band a sonic backbone that bridged the metal ’80s with the impending alt-rock boom of the ’90s. But the weapon that made them a mainstream force was singer Chris Cornell, who tragically passed away last week. The many tributes to Cornell that have been written since his passing have rightly focused on his massive range and masterful control of his vocal instrument.  presents him as a much rawer presence than the generational talent who stalks the songs on  and   But it also shows limitless promise, like a rookie who can’t defend the pick-and-roll yet but can dunk from the foul line. The ecstatic joy of Cornell’s voice breathes pulsing, wriggling life into the album. His lyrics sometimes skew dark, as on the jaundiced love song “Head Injury,” but they’re written from a perspective far more inscrutable than the bleak autobiography of later songs like “Outshined” and “Fell on Black Days.” The Cornell-penned “Beyond the Wheel” is the best song on the record, and it’s a stone-cold Soundgarden classic. Cornell starts the song in a low, rumbling baritone, but ratchets his register up to a Rob Halford-like falsetto, doing battle with Thayil’s jagged guitar. A crisp new Jack Endino-helmed mix—the way the album was always meant to sound, according to the band—makes the song’s impact even stronger. “We’re driving flesh and blood / Deep into the ground,” Cornell howls at the song’s climax, and those lines induce chills every time. Cornell would go on to be one of the best singers in rock history, but the primal yawp of “Beyond the Wheel” remains a major high point — gloriously unhinged, and brimming with the possibility of what was to come. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/soundgarden-ultramegaok-review"}

But in a union made in Afrobeat heaven, Ahehehinnou connected with Ignace de Souza at Decca Studios in Lagos, who agreed to serve as his arranger for several unrecorded songs.

Founders Brett Parnell and Geremy Schulick met while studying guitar at the Yale School of Music and released two albums of spare instrumentals, interpreting Bach and Scarlatti on the former and playing their own compositions on the latter. Since then, Threefifty has gradually grown into something resembling a rock band, as they added new members (including their multi-instrumentalist wives) and expanded their sound from classical to folk, bluegrass, and the post-rock of groups like Rachel’s and Mogwai. That “post-” prefix has dogged them for a few years now, and on their latest album,   Threefifty have done little to dispel the label. Opener “Crossing State Lines” and “Andromeda” feature pointillist guitar notes that arrange themselves into melodic constellations, the band churning up a dramatic din behind them. Acoustic instruments, mainly mandolin and fiddle, mingle with electric guitars, picked and strummed to add a folksy flavor to the “The Door” and “You Are Going the Right Way.” To that framework, they add unexpected flourishes: L.A. electronic musician Daedelus undergirds “More” with jagged rhythms, which spar violently with Parnell and Schulick’s guitars—it doesn’t evoke a jam session as much as a knife fight. “Running in a Burning House” is a showcase for New York multi-instrumentalist Nathan Koci, whose deployment of whistling and trumpet call to mind the gunslinger soundtracks of Ennio Morricone.

In the half-century since, the three have remained best friends and Como residents, regularly singing together at their childhood church, Mt. Moriah. It has only been in the past decade, as the trio has entered later age, that they have solidified their friendship into a musical ensemble—the Como Mamas. After a chance encounter with Daptone Records producer Michael Reilly, the Como Mamas recorded their 2013 debut,  , at Mt. Moriah; its 13 tracks were comprised solely of their voices. Offsetting gruff and gritty howls with sweeter tones, the album was rich in both texture and melody. , their follow-up, is immediately distinct from its predecessor: it features a full band. But instead of diluting the trio’s magnetic voices, the arrangements, recorded live in the studio by Daptone Records’ “family band,” give the songs momentum and energy. While the band’s contributions are at times minimal—like the sparse percussion on “Glory Glory Hallelujah”—they can also pivot on a dime, delivering a walloping proto-blues romp. Lead single “Out of the Wilderness” swings like a long-lost Otis Redding track, and the title track features an infectious call and response. Thematically, the album is grounded, fully, in the culture of the church. As Daniels recently explained, “In Como, church is  ,” and these songs, all of which are interpretations of old traditionals and spirituals, focus on themes of redemption, gratitude and the glory of a higher power. Yet it’s hard to approach these sentiments solely through the lens of religion; the Como Mamas lived through segregation in a largely impoverished town, and have seen tough times become, at least on surface level, less so. As Smith explained recently, she’s “infinitely grateful to God for giving her the resources to raise two kids who never had to pick cotton, wear clothes made from old flour sacks, or go hungry in lean times” like she did. The Como Mamas’ music is both celebratory and redemptive. —", "genre": ["R&B/Soul", "Soul", "Gospel"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/como-mamas-move-upstairs-review"}

It’s not difficult to understand why the song was a success. Miranda and her band engineered a fusion between bossa nova and trip-hop that benefitted from her cultural fluidity—she’s of British and Brazilian descent. Navigating between those two worlds, she drew from both her knowledge of  , aka MPB, as well as the sounds of ‘90s Britain (think: Basement Jaxx, Massive Attack). Miranda sang—half in Portuguese, half in English—in the soft, melodic lilt typical of the bossa nova singers of the ’60s, using the beauty and gentleness of one language and the brevity and directness of the other to paint a picture of living and loving in two cultures. On her first solo album,  Miranda builds on that blueprint, creating music that straddles the line between nostalgia for her homeland, and the need to embrace the world that surrounds her. Perhaps that’s why   feels like a musical tug-of-war. On tracks like “Capoeira 2020,” “Julia,” and “Silken Horse,” Miranda playfully explores samba percussion, mixing it with nu-disco, funk, and bossa nova. But she’s also not afraid to experiment: “The Cage” combines buzzsaw guitars with ‘70s funk basslines, distorted vocals, and soulful choruses, while its lyrics plead for freedom in a country that’s growing increasingly restrictive. Miranda’s voice shines on the dramatic slow burner “Amazonia Amor,” where she trades verses with both a male vocalist and the sounds of the rainforest. The net effect recalls Carla Bruni’s performance of “Dolce Francia”—both songs are beautiful homages to the respective singers’ homelands.  is Miranda’s way of reintroducing herself to the world as both a singer and performer, an album that revels in experimentation, but doesn’t shy away from embracing tradition.

On the cover of her new release,  with her band Big Thief, Lenker’s uncle holds her as an infant. His piercing stare correlates tangentially with lyrics from “Mythological Beauty,” her most straightforwardly autobiographical song to date. “I have an older brother I don’t know / He could be anywhere.” She casts outward, hoping for a reconnection that grows more distant with each passing day. , Lenker speaks to host Bob Boilen on how making music assists with her coming to terms with the past: “I feel like my capacity for loving and understanding who I am, where I come from, my family…is always growing through the songs.” This is a distinct progression from  , Big Thief’s first LP that largely presented her ruminations on unique people (“Paul,” “Lorraine,” “Randy”), places (“Vegas,” “Interstate”), and entities (“Humans,” “Animals”). No longer sufficed by one-step-back storytelling, Lenker takes on the demanding process of revisiting her childhood on  , but chooses to meet the painful moments with a emotional strength born from empathy. The bracing manner of her retelling an assault on “Watering” finds her regaining control over trauma. Elements of mortality appear throughout: tears, blood, oxygen, skin, sexual fluids. Lenker’s perspective changes from storyteller to active participant, speaking as her present self: “And you know that I’m there / As you soak in my stare.” As “Watering” finishes on a tender note, Lenker relieves her younger self of the pain and guilt that has festered for too long. Big Thief attunes their music to fit the finer details, as on “Shark Smile,” where a harrowing tale of losing someone in a car accident is met with classic rock gravitas. The entire song plays like  -era Springsteen, sparking with the insistent riffs of a midnight road trip as Lenker’s escapism runs into reality: “It came over me at a bad time / She burned over the double line / And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail.” Her last lines spark with a hint of regret, but abruptly let go with the track’s hard stop. As the album concludes its excavation of Lenker’s past, the atmosphere on the later songs becomes solitary and therapeutic. The necessary determination of electric guitars and painful recollections dissolve into acoustic instruments, subtle rhythms, and meditative serenity. Accented by organ hum and solo piano, the chorus on “Mary” works as a focused mantra, sweeping away bitter remnants with lilting elegance.  For the whole of  , Lenker and Big Thief firmly take the wheel of each song’s narrative, spinning together threads of memories and events, weaving them into newfound empowerment.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/big-thief-capacity-review"}

While it’s easy to call this album avant-garde or psychedelic due to its spectral mood, it’s really that   is a remarkably focused effort that’s rooted in jazz while pulling in hip-hop, folk, and ambient work. Branch arrives at her debut having spent her formative years in the Chicago music scene, where she played with noise-rock group Musket and experimental jazz trio Rupert, among many other outfits. Now living in Brooklyn’s Red Hook community,   finds Branch at the helm of her own quartet, which features Chad Taylor on drums, Jason Ajemian on bass, and Tomeka Reid on cello. Though   is technically a solo album, each musician plays a vital role in the album’s meditative aura. Songs like “leaves of glass” and “waltzer” rumble along slowly, emitting Eno-like vibes as they progress. “Theme nothing,” the record’s centerpiece, exudes a strong Latin jazz melody centered on Branch’s sporadic horn wails and Taylor’s percussive groove.

Today, we can point to new or recent albums by envelope-pushing artists like  ,  ,  ,  , and others as hallmarks of a creative climate that’s rife with out-of-the-box thinking. And with hip-hop’s international reach more prevalent than ever, the genre’s capacity to absorb outside influences appears limitless. It says a lot, then, that Lando Chill’s third full-length,  , sounds as inventive as it does. Where Chill’s previous two full-lengths and EP hewed closer to your typical soul-rap fusion, the new album immediately announces itself as the most richly varied work of the Tucson-based rapper/poet’s career to date. This time, Chill and returning producer/multi-instrumentalist Lasso take a quantum leap forward, arguably bringing the alternative hip-hop paradigm along for the ride. This is all the more remarkable considering that Chill, whose real name is Lance Washington, didn’t grow up as an especially avid fan of rap music. Instead, he had a much deeper affinity for jazz and classical, which shows in his emphasis on timbre, as well as in the way he frequently foregoes beats for free-form atmospheres. A haunting piano loop, for example, anchors “o sicario e o padre” (Portuguese for “the hit man and the priest”). The song does contain a rather stock, minimal hip-hop beat, but the piano, which is fragmented and heavily smeared in reverb, lands the music closer to the moody stillness of, say, the electronic duo Lamb than to Chill’s alt-rap contemporaries. A less imaginative artist more focused on keeping up with trends might have thrown in some trap elements, but Chill and Benbi, the track’s producer, clearly weren’t interested in taking the easy way out. Instead, they let the beat drop out in the song’s ambient-leaning middle section, where Lando trades in his rapid-fire flow for a more melodic delivery that’s treated with effects for a touch of surrealism. As spare as it gets, “o sicario” is a gripping, utterly sumptuous piece of music—just one of several in a sprawling track sequence that unfolds more like a suite than a grouping of 15 disparate tracks. Much like on Joni Mitchell’s 1975 landmark  , jazz functions as a departure point on  , so that the music is no longer quite recognizable as jazz. The album also strains against the limits of hip-hop. Dense and challenging,   doesn’t digest easily in one sitting, at least not at first.

Through these projects, Weaver delved deep into wildly adventurous and equally inviting prog-pop. The work represented a sensational creative breakthrough that continues to animate and propel Weaver’s activity. Where she loped from star to star on  , the new song cycle on  appears more rooted and determinate, like a report or interrogation to map the astral explorations of her two prior releases. While the motorik rhythms and multi-tracked vocals are sure to kick up cosmetic references such as Stereolab, there’s an intimate aesthetic sub-layer that hearkens back to Weaver’s earliest recordings in the mid-’90s with her first group, Kill Laura. Recollections of  ’s transcendental folk modes and Sparklehorse’s scrappy studio alchemy are evident, and would have certainly been in the orbit of a young Mancunian listener circa 1995.

On previous albums  released in 2013, and their self-titled 2010 debut, the band have fleshed out Payseur’s delicate, melodic compositions, amassing a solid catalogue of songs that toe the improbable line between dreamy and anthemic. On their latest full-length,  , Beach Fossils add even more nuance to their brand of melancholy guitar pop. While the music is bright and playful, the lyrics find Payseur struggling through loneliness, underscoring the impermanence of personal relationships. The heady, mid-tempo, piano-pop groover “Saint Ivy” combines a bouncy rhythm with dynamic classical strings, as Payseur’s lyrics touch on both cynicism and hopefulness. With its weaving bassline and the chorus’s gently-circling guitar, “Sugar” could be an outtake from a lost 4AD record. Underneath the gauzy instrumentation, Payseur’s vocal refrain—“On the outside, change your mind, feeling nothing”—hints at detachment and alienation. The album closes with the softly-jangling “That’s All for Now,” which opens with sorrowful lyrics: “It’s new regret / Isn’t it funny how we forget?” Payseur sings. Eventually, the song’s mid-tempo groove gives way to tender, wilting slide guitar, as Payseur advises: “Keep moving on, keep moving on.” It’s a fitting end to an album that reconciles the immediacy of heartbreak with the transitory nature of life and love. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/beach-fossils-somersault-review"}

Atop brittle, needling guitars and rigid grooves, Brown seems to mine the pain of repressive adolescence in strikingly literal terms. When Brown isn’t near sobbing, he’s   sobbing; it sounds channeled from within the process of confronting trauma, rather than from some later moment of relative resolution, especially on the 2015 full-length  Institute’s first record since, is a slight yet significant departure. A thicker and firmer recording, it’s more akin to Institute’s punchy live presence (and less to the old leftist English punk band Crisis). Far from the great jostling simplicity of early material like “Giddy Boys,” the songs on   expand to accommodate instrumental detours. And Brown, though still a wailer, mixes his spittle with a bit more venom. The lyrics refer to “oil wealth” in a “Southern state” rife with racist “good ol’ boys,” plus heteronormative indoctrination via television and how “sexually insecure police cause violence.” (There are certainly shades of The Dicks’ classic “Hate the Police.”) He’s zooming out, dismayed by how patriarchy and racism conspire to impoverish and destroy nonconforming bodies.  . You won’t make out many of the words (there’s a lyrics sheet), but the band’s politics are refreshingly earnest. Brown uses vocabulary—words like “bourgeois,” which he memorably burps in two songs—that other contemporary punk lyricists might find pretty tired or hackneyed. It works because, rather than taking a stance of righteous distance, Brown’s queasy delivery and personal tie-ins emphasize the suffocating omnipresence of intersecting oppressions—much like The Dicks’ Gary Floyd. Critical observation leaves him indignant as well as depressed, no further from a society that prescribes him an unwanted sort of masculinity—just more aware of the coercion.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/institute-subordination-review"}

The U.K. ensemble has spent years squeezing fragments of hip-hop, jazz, psych, and krautrock into their hypnotic, thrumming compositions since debuting on DJ Shadow’s 2006 album  . The group’s fourth album,  , boasts a similar blend of sounds, but the addition of Slovakian vocalist Barbora Patkova brings a fresh element, putting their minor-key grooves into thrilling new context. Although Patkova, like her new bandmates, has a tendency to construct music out of improvised jams, her melodies here are airtight and highly finessed. On opening track “Made of the Sun,” she delivers a scorching, operatic performance that stands in sharp contrast to the slow-burning arrangement. On “Oh Brother,” she snakes effortlessly through an avalanche of percussion and, on the title track, she seems to disappear into a hazy horn arrangement. Which is not to say that the Heliocentrics themselves don’t bring the heat;  remains a largely instrumental affair, full of complex rhythmic ideas and taut horn lines. Drummer and bandleader Malcolm Catto continues to deliver deft work, particularly on the nimble “The Silverback” and the aptly-titled “Human Zoo.” Jake Ferguson’s agile bass parts add a subtle warmth throughout the album, and Oliver Parfitt’s sprinkles of keyboards provide a balance to the group’s thundering low end, like on the lurching “Dawn Chorus.” While the album doesn’t necessarily revolve around Patkova, the Heliocentrics’ constellation benefits from her captivating presence—and, as a result, burns all the brighter. —", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/the-heliocentrics-a-world-of-masks-review"}

Greene’s new album,  , is yet another departure for him: here, he reflects on what it means to be a young adult in these trying times. That topic hits home for the 34-year-old Greene, though he doesn’t take it too seriously. “The album guides the listener through the highs and lows of this often ridiculous struggle,” says an album description on label Stones Throw’s website. To convey the absurdity of everyday life, Greene litters   with oddball samples, twisting the cuts to make them sound even crazier. On “Zonked” and “I’ve Been Daydreaming My Entire Life,” in particular, the manipulated effects add moments of levity, defusing the gravity of such a weighty topic.

On their new album  , the band keeps this experimental spirit alive—but this is music to get people dancing. ’s jumble of ambient, funk, and post-punk isn’t exactly what anyone would call “poppy,” though, or “accessible,” which implies it’s somehow unchallenging. “Crystal Run” opens up with vocalist Kassie Carlson warbling “Change the frequencyyyyy” over murky synths and buzzing background chatter that makes good on  ’s blotter acid cover art, hurtling headlong into a weird trip. Still, the songs on  are bright and catchy, and Guerilla Toss’ fringe styles here are fueled by a genuine desire for exploration rather than cheap shock value. “Can I Get the Real Stuff” gives us the purest hooks of the sort they teased on their previous LP release,  . “TV Do Tell” is a neon-hued punk song in the tradition of X-Ray Spex, complete with tongue-in-cheek lyrics about media consumption. On past albums, Carlson’s lyrics were buried in the mix, but here they’re pushed up to the front: “Personal persona, can I get the real stuff / Swimming in the makeup”; “My eyes were on the screen of my own interests,” and lead single “The String Game” and the hectic “Dose Rate” pack in enough spoken word sections, scorched-Earth guitars, and sci-fi synth histrionics for plenty of repeat listens.

Insular, moody, and at times abstract,  captures sentiments rarely heard in Chaz Bear (formerly Bundick)’s work: self-doubt, loneliness, and, ostensibly, heartbreak. Although the album begins with an upbeat sentiment—“I just wanted everybody to have a good time”—things quickly get darker from there. “No Show,” for instance, offers up a bittersweet summation of Toro y Moi’s success, delivered in a beautiful cadence—“Wasn’t even thinkin’ we were going worldwide / Figured it was better than the Southern life”—but also presents the repercussions: a partner who eventually “got fed up with my ego.” Later, “Windows” finds him acknowledging a need for a “new state of mind” and “You and I” paints an unflinching picture of Bear working obsessively to distract himself from the aftermath of a relationship. Yet  is also jam-packed with exquisite arrangements that provide a counterpoint for Bear’s angst and confusion. “Labyrinth” possesses the sublime pulse of the Talking Heads’ “Naïve Melody,” and lead single “Girl Like You” is a smart R&B slow-burner that culminates in a radiant piano bridge. Bear has always had an ear for minute detail, and  is no exception. Those looking for a party album will not find it here.

On   (“The Deaf Ears” in French), Megarbane’s latest album as Cosmic Analog Ensemble, the composer opts for cinematic 1970s funk and soul, the type you’d hear in a spaghetti western or Quentin Tarantino flick. Using electric and acoustic guitars, flutes, and clavinet (among many other instruments), Megarbane builds a lush, beautifully constructed suite—incredibly haunting and robust, nodding to the orchestral soul of forefathers Curtis Mayfield, David Axelrod, and Isaac Hayes, and newer conductors like Adrian Younge and BADBADNOTGOOD. While there are standout songs,   should be played without breaks to thoroughly absorb its scene-setting ambience.

Oreilles harbors a distinct ‘70s ethos, yet it draws from the same well of which rapper Ghostface Killah and producer Madlib pull their sounds.

One of the few things they haven’t done, until now, is release a double album. In typical Melvins fashion,   is no ordinary double album. Disc One ( ) is the more straightforward of the pair. In the late 2000s, singer and guitarist Buzz Osborne complained that Melvins were too often stereotyped by lazy listeners as a slow band when they actually had plenty of speedier numbers in their repertoire. He’d be hard pressed to deny that  ’s songs veer back towards the slower end. Yet in a refreshing twist to Melvins’ usual Sabbath-smitten sound, they’re also kinda light and breezy, even lighter than the “Melvins Lite” incarnation of the group from circa 2012. Naturally, Osborne’s phat riffs and Dale Crover’s Bonham-esque drum fireworks remain present and correct, but there’s a novel softness here to suggest the two hard-rock curmudgeons may finally be starting to chill. Perhaps the laid-back feel is thanks to latest bass recruit, Redd Kross’ Steven McDonald, who has been a perma-grinning and happy-go-lucky presence on the band’s recent tours.

In their familiar-to-some blend of classic rock, hardcore, melodic punk, and rootsy country-grunge, Lee Bains III and the Glory Fires insists on a version of Southern rock that interrogates its region’s history while explicitly fighting for Southern progress. With its sprawling 17-song tracklist,  finds Bains zeroing in his focus as a songwriter. The album is primarily an expansive, multi-angled exploration of the way in which Bains’s hometown of Birmingham socializes its children along racial and class lines. Songs like “Black & White Boys” and “Good Old Boy” are fierce polemics that jolt the band’s message into sharp clarity, while the album centerpiece triplet of “I Heard God!,” “Crooked Letters,” and “I Can Change!,” complete with a sample of children chanting and audio snippets of protester rallying calls, show off the band’s  -level ambition. Bains is a bookish songwriter whose intersectional Southern-punk has always been interested in the colliding worlds of religion, history, gender, and identity. With  , he’s made his most thoroughly urgent album, one that concerns itself with the problems of the here and now more thoroughly, and convincingly, than any of his previous work, which tended to be more historically-minded. But for all his scholarly leanings, Bains is an unpretentious, pop-loving, rock ‘n’ roller keen on physical detail as a songwriter and sympathetic to the occasional anthemic chorus (“Whitewash,” “Nail My Feet Down To the Southside of Town”). On  , which blends the band’s heady conceptualizing with a sturdy batch of solemn sing-alongs, Lee Bains III and the Glory Fires have finally made an album worthy of the group’s outsized ambition. —", "genre": ["Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/lee-bains-iii-glory-fires-review"}

While Lee is a master of digital samples and beats, every note Bei Bei plays enjoys its own life and meaning. On “Love in Hong Kong” and “Year of the Funky,” Bei Bei improvises inventively over Lee’s dance beats. Her guzheng sounds particularly rich accompanied by mallet instruments, as on “Purple River,” where she deploys tactically precise quavers over Lee’s four-on-the-floor. But her playing displays a different quality entirely on tracks like the traditional Chinese folk song “Water Lotus,” which she performs subtly behind the beat, over Lee’s liquid bass lines and hand percussion. The duo extend their parameters on “Black Nylon,” a guzheng boogie punctuated with sharp attacks, and “Danxia Disco,” a modern take on happy hour at the Hong Kong Hilton circa 1982. The duo’s elegant minimalism comes together sublimely on closing track “For Your Smile,” in which Bei Bei duets poignantly with herself over Lee’s retro beats.

On its recent EP,  , the Brooklyn quartet offers four songs that use indie rock as a gateway for more expansive sounds, continuing the heavily-detailed miniaturist mode that drew attention to their 2016 self-titled debut EP. Psychedelia at its best works as a synthesis of opposites; happy contradictions animate Crumb’s work. The group is fronted by singer and guitarist Lila Ramani, whose unhurried delivery communicates a certain restlessness, as she leads her bandmates through intimate territory that seems emotionally vast. On the title track, for instance, she describes the effect that precipitation has on her emotional state: “Every time it rains,” Ramani sings, “I can feel my brain is moving, back and forth, upside down, east-west.” The music on   bucks against the claustrophobia of the lyrics, with meaty bass from Jesse Brotter and myriad flourishes from Brian Aronow, who plays a variety of instruments in service of the record’s quiet sonic diversity. It feels like a milder version of Tame Impala’s reverberating guitar, bass and synth combos, or a slightly more cheerful echo of Whitney’s melancholy Americana. And Ramani, whose lyrics hint at heartbreak, is a remarkably easygoing vocalist, her voice winding its way around the riffage. On “Thirty-Nine,” she casually prompts the band to let loose with one of several killer instrumental breaks, singing deadpan, “I hope they’re ready for the hot, crispy sound.” That’s all it takes for the rest of the group to join in, with all the relaxed proficiency for which it’s becoming known. —", "genre": ["Rock", "fusion"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/crumb-locket-album-review"}

Her music—a darker take on Americana that calls to mind Lee Hazlewood and Mazzy Star—should be hits in another world’s Top 40, no question, but they’re definitely not crap. Range is key throughout  . One of the album’s quietest songs, “Mary,” is nestled at the heart of the album, and is immediately followed up with the big, easy-going swagger of “Life’s A Lie.” Other songs carefully invert expectations: “Paranoia” starts with bass and vocals only, suggesting a bleaker approach, but then shifts into a lovely, downright uplifting full arrangement and chorus before concluding with a big—but not ham-fisted—ending. That makes the slow doom grind of “Nothing” hit harder, with growling tones underscoring its final two minutes, like a threat. If the album has a standout track, it’s “Soon,” an intimate performance which showcases Von Schleicher’s precise creative control. You can hear that focus in the way gentle drum taps cut through the arrangement, the way the keyboards and guitars complement and echo each other, the way saxophone carefully emerges towards the end, and the way that ending is sudden, but not abrupt.

His compositions, and the label itself, serve multiple purposes: to make the avant-garde more accessible, while pushing the limits of pop music. On  , Gunther’s third LP as Dzang, the multi-instrumentalist crafts dance-indebted rap, gorgeous piano ballads, and everything in between. Gunther uses   as a showcase for L.A.’s up-and-coming singers and songwriters, allowing vocalists like Maria Minerva and Olivia Kaplan to shine without obstruction. Minerva and Kaplan are featured on two songs apiece, and their voices mesh perfectly with Gunther’s slinking psychedelic romps and minimal, pop-oriented melodies. Elsewhere, on “So Young,” an alt-R&B tune with massive percussion, Gunther enlists L.A. mainstay Maxim Ludwig, whose floating hums wash in from a celestial place. Conversely, on album opener “My Name (Nana),” Gunther gets help from rapper Don Christian, who spits double-time flows over an austere dance beat and pitch-shifted vocals. This and other tracks speak to Gunther’s equally thrilling and off-kilter sonic world. Though Dzang is a project based on collaboration, some of  ’s strongest moments come when Gunther performs alone. “Supercomplication” is a warm, electro-shoegaze anthem, blending the astral progressions of M83 with the low-end thump of Flying Lotus’s early beat scene forays. The album’s final track, “Take You Down To,” begins with hypnotic looping before descending into free jazz. Its thumping, four-on-the-floor bass drum keeps the song rooted. ’s most impressive trick isn’t the album’s diversity, it’s how seamlessly this multitude of influences blend into something entirely fresh.

Heinali’s soundscapes are often classified as ambient, but he’s also acknowledged metal bands like   as inspirations. The droning, pulsing textures of a song like “October Light,” off the duo’s latest,  , fit into the tradition of fuzzed-out, cross-eyed psychedelic drift from Pink Floyd through Sonic Youth post-rock. It’s easy to see Heinali listening to fellow countrymen  , or vice versa, especially as the track hits the five-minute mark and it starts to emit a feedback-driven, wailing howl, coupled to a frantic drumming groove. It’s like a soundtrack for fleeing in dreamlike slow motion from wolves across a frozen tundra. Finney’s spoken word contributions are mostly mixed low—inflectionless nightmare whispers. “Maybe you stumble out of the wilderness four years later and you think you still have something to say, but all you do is go from desperate moment to desperate moment,” he mutters on “Wilderness.” “Lose your hair, lose a child, your dad dies,” he adds, his bland inertia and despair increasingly drowned out by Heinali’s shimmering symphony of moans—a fleet of ghosts eating literary fiction’s corpse.

Even Cloher’s famous wife and collaborator, Courtney Barnett, doesn’t quite approach the level of scouring self-examination and fearless venting that Cloher makes routine against the full-band rock of her self-titled fourth album. “Indie rock is full of privileged white kids / I know because I’m one of them,” she sings on the T. Rex strut of “Shoegazers,” which also skewers music critics (“Those who can, they do / Those who can’t, review”) as well as anyone who confuses commercial success with artistic fulfillment. That song sprang from Cloher’s experiences on tour with Barnett, who also plays guitar in Cloher’s band. Others, like “Sensory Memory” and lead single “Forgot Myself,” are about the psychological pitfalls of staying home while your wife is on the road for months on end. Typical of Cloher, “Forgot Myself” is generous with references, casually citing peers like The Drones and Patti Smith before paraphrasing two iconic lines from The Stones: “You’re riding round the world / You’re doing this and you’re signing that.” “Loose Magic” is a freewheeling fable about the power of live music that was inspired by Dirty Three; “Great Australian Bite” is about Aussie bands that nearly destroy themselves moving overseas to make it. Those referential flare-ups only fuel the gnashing release of Cloher’s songwriting, which can call out Australia’s piss-poor progress on marriage equality (“Analysis Paralysis”) just as easily as it can celebrate her sexuality (“Strong Woman”) and articulate the depth of her love (closing ballad “Dark Art”). She even strikes out into Bacharach-meets-Callahan jauntiness on the distinctly hopeful “Waiting in the Wings.” Released on Cloher and Barnett’s own reliable label, Milk!

Murky and enigmatic, their old-school doom metal rises out of the bayou like a sultry bog witch, throwing an electric funeral for the Delta blues. They certainly aren’t the first to inject that Southern swagger into classic metal. They just do it with a singular panache. The voodoo rituals on could make the dead get up and dance. Pierina O’Brien’s ominous figure on the cover recalls the mystery woman who adorns the first Black Sabbath record, and I suspect that’s deliberate. Devil Electric don’t exactly hide their Sabbath worship, but they also don’t let it get in their way. Tom Hulse’s bass intro to “The Sacred Machine” is pure Geezer Butler. Still, even on that song, Christos Athanasias’s guitar work has a southern bite that distinguishes it from Tony Iommi’s. And you would never mistake O’Brien for Ozzy Osbourne. Her throaty howl continues a blues rock lineage that stretches from Janis Joplin all the way to Royal Thunder’s Mlny Parsonz and Blues Pills’ Elin Larsson. Drummer Mark Van De Beek rounds out the quartet, his drums bringing a welcome swing that they lacked on their previous   EP. Tom Glover’s production makes it all sound devilishly heavy. The thickness of the sonic gumbo wouldn’t really matter if the songwriting wasn’t catchy, but Devil Electric didn’t neglect that ingredient. “Monologue (Where You Once Walked)” sets the tone perfectly, bouncing from foot to foot in mocking revelry. O’Brien’s vocals on “Shadowman” ooze libidinous tension, “Lady Velvet” tightens the screws until the guitars explode into violence, “The Dove & the Serpent” uses the dynamics between the minimalist verses and fuzzed-out choruses to create an apocalyptic mood. Much as Black Sabbath appropriated the blues in their own way, these Australians successfully take sounds that originated halfway around the world and decades in the past and make them their own.

But their approach is decidedly psychedelic: where much of punk favors distinct riffs and big, melodic hooks, Weeping Icon instead drape loose blankets of guitar over ramrod percussion. In a short time, they’ve become one of New York’s most captivating live bands, and in the concert setting, they extend songs to epic length, letting the layers of hypnotic sound pile up one on top of the other, and allowing the songs to wander instead of move directly from point A to B. The effect is absorbing and mirage-like, wavy, distorted chords dissolving from concrete noise to abstract sound. They capture that same sense of free-roaming adventure throughout  . Though most of its songs remain comfortably inside of four minutes, there’s the sense that they could go on four times as long and not lose any power. Instead of bludgeoning with force, they unnerve you with repetition. Album standout “Teeth (& A Handbag)” tells the same story of a subway robbery over and over; the song’s lyrics feel jarring at first, then determined, then, finally, furious. The music works in tandem; the bass and drums adhere rigidly to a single pattern, but the guitars billow out infinitely, filling all available airspace with sound. When they finally arrive at the idea of revenge, it appears in a kind of chilling moral isolation chamber—it’s presented, but never commented or acted upon. The rocketing “Jail Billz,” a snarling tale of street harassment, follows a similar M.O.: guitars saw away at a single transfixing riff while the cold-eyed drumming rockets forward at a furious pace. The walls collapse and the song seems to expand outward endlessly.   isn’t an experimental record so much as an   one. You don’t listen to it—you let it envelop you, until you finally disappear within the haze. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "psychedelic rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/weeping-icon-eyeball-under-review"}

Nimco Jamaac’s “Buuraha U Dheer (The Highest Mountains)” is a soaring mid-tempo rocker with winding synth and string parts running counter to the gorgeous vocal melody. With its slow-rolling blues tempo and chicken-scratch guitar hitting on the on half-note downbeat, Iftiin Band (featuring Mahmud Abdalla “Jerry” Hussen and Maryan Naasir)’s “Xuduud Ma Leh Xubigaan (This Love Has No Boundaries)” is reminiscent of a psychedelic, East African take on James Brown’s classic “King Heroin.” When Naasir takes over the start of the second verse, her shining soprano cuts through the mix with fire and passion. The majority of the tracks here posses many similar aesthetic characteristics: rickety electric organs, reverb, tape delay-saturated vocals, and the percussion-heavy rhythms of Northeast Africa. One could characterize the recording aesthetic here as “lo-fi,” but when listening to the songs of love, passion, devotion, and celebration compiled on  it is abundantly clear that there is something deeper happening here. The musical choices made on these recordings were both borne out of necessity and are a reflection of the unique tastes and triumphs of Somalia’s musical community—and, by extension, the Somali people. As brilliant as this and similar compilations are, they will not stop the violence or free the Somali people from the cycle of war, poverty, and the aftermath of Western neocolonialism that plagues many nations on the African continent.

{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0014509243_2.jpg", "album": "S/T", "artist": "Rainer Maria", "description": "In the early days, Rainer Maria was a band of shouters. The crashing drums, the thunderous guitar, the serpentine bass—the trio created a mountain of sound that, it seemed, could only be scaled by Caithlin DeMarrais and Kaia Fischer screaming their heads off. It was glorious and youthful, but it was also unsustainable. By the time the band moved from Madison to Brooklyn in the late ’90s, they were already looking for ways to pretty up their sound, lest DeMarrais lose more and more shows to shredded vocals cords. “Pretty” was something Rainer Maria aspired to anyway, of course; the increasingly softening force of the music left room for soft thoughts and complicated emotional revelations. The band that, on its first album, had belted out the most emo line of all time—“Call an ambulance, I don’t want to walk home alone” on the track “Tinfoil”—was now summoning mature and peculiar moments of grace. , released in 2006, was instantly appealing and the band’s best attempt at balancing the musical id with the lyrical superego. Song after song predicted the end of the world. On the heavier tracks (“Life of Leisure” and “Catastrophe,” in particular), they put their sweetest thoughts on asteroids and let them burn up, sometimes with explosive results. And then there were the gentler songs, like “Terrified,” which DeMarrais sang with awesome bewilderment and fragility: “On these old streets, I can’t believe you’re not walking next to me / I can almost feel your hand in my back pocket.” By then, she’d long become the lead singer. Fischer was best making her presence felt with moody, muscular guitarwork that provided endless opportunities for the band to go nuts in exhilarating ways. Having achieved the kind of underappreciated perfection that mostly leaves you gasping for air in hot basement shows, the band called it quits later that year. A return did not seem inevitable, but it came, first with reunion shows and now with  , a comeback album that makes progress on all the things this restless band has always done well. Self-titled albums are handy for bands looking to make a statement, that statement usually being, “Here we are.” Rainer Maria already dropped an album called   a long time ago, so this one’s called , and it’s a statement by a band reborn—“here we are  .” A lot has happened in the 11 years since  . DeMarrais released two complicatedly pretty solo records and started a family. Fischer studied Tibetan Buddhism and came out as transgender. Drummer Bill Kuehn traveled the world, studying music and living in Syria and Yemen, among other places. Produced by Kuehn,   is Rainer Maria at their brightest. The songs bubble with nervous energy. Many are loud. Several are joyous, in a we’re-still-alive kinda way. Bolstered by Fischer, DeMarrais’s voice finds new depth, and comes closer to shouting than it has in a long time. This band is fired up. “Let the rest of the world be coarse / You stay sweet for me,” DeMarrais implores on the blazing and catchy “Suicides and Lazy Eyes.” That song leads directly into “Lower Worlds,” an artful and unexpectedly groovy rocker bolstered by Fischer’s fierce backup vocals. “Communicator” is fun and ferocious, shot through with rocketing punk energy. If there’s any of that that old apocalyptic angst left, it’s turned inward. On opener “Broke Open Love,” crashing cymbals and heavy guitar dissipate for a hopeless refrain—“I know, I know, I’m fucking up / I don’t want to fuck up”—then return with a vengeance. DeMarrais’s bass never stops careening and coiling. “I’ll never be alone if I can help it / Talkin’ to the flowers just to have a friend,” she sings on “Forest Mattress,” one of several songs that reference the natural world as a place of mystery and refuge. The slow and spooky “Hellbore” swoons with softly spoken words and long, angular chords, recalling the shadowy beauty of Mazzy Star. The hellbore, by the way, is an oddball in the arboreal world: It’s pretty and it’s poisonous, and it blooms in winter.

That decision to “hide” his voice is an indication of why   is so successful: it plays out like a true collaboration, with no one half hogging the spotlight. Anyone familiar with Kidkanevil or Noah’s previous work knows they have a penchant for creating music that lands on the drowsier side of the spectrum, but rarely has either of them grasped what it means to be truly   in that restfulness. In a world full of humanoid worker bees, it’s comforting to hear a record so keen on relaxation. —", "genre": ["Ambient", "chill out"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/nemui-pj-pumpkin-ep-album-review"}

The elusive duo has always been allegedly made up of provocative singer-songwriter Dean Blunt and enigmatic Russian artist Inga Copeland. Their myth goes like this: they’ve been working together since 2005 and began releasing projects in 2009 including the 2011-released compilation  . Two years later, the duo split. New music released under the Hype Williams moniker began to surface again in the middle of 2016, but everything since   has now been dubbed as frauds by Ninja Tune imprint Big Dada, who will release  , the supposedly first true Hype Williams album since  .

Many of them, like standouts “Puredamage” and “Smokebox,” clock in at less than a minute, but still make an impression; the former is 30 seconds of glassy electronics and tripping, detuned guitar; the latter features a rubbery bassline bouncing beneath mirage-like synths. The album’s brevity—maintained almost throughout except for the six-minute ethereal meditation “Spinderella’s Dream”—makes way for its mysteries. You can spelunk for the origins its samples (like the relationship advice call-in show clip on “Ask Yee”) and other references, ad nauseam. With so many tracks packed into 37 minutes, there is a lot to discover under the static. The best and most meta moment on the album comes is a crackling track called “This is Mister Bigg. How You Doing Mister Bigg,” which is full of ominous synths, creeping, doomy percussion and a keyboard line that sounds like it was plucked from a John Carpenter score. Its title is a reference to the cinematic remix of R&B singer Kelly Price’s 1998 breakout single “Friend of Mine.” That song featured vocals from R. Kelly and the icon Ronald Isley, who duet in proto-“Trapped in the Closet” fashion. Its video was created by acclaimed music video director and group namesake, Hype Williams. The group could have referenced Williams in a host of more obvious ways, tipping their hat to, say, Missy Elliott’s breakthrough video for “The Rain,” or the sensual cyberpunk world of Busta Rhymes’s “What’s It Gonna Be.” Instead, they went with an odd lyric, cherry-picked from a song that was never a crossover hit. It’s just the kind of maverick ornament that’s become expected of Hype Williams—whoever they may be. —", "genre": ["Experimental", "underground hip hop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/hype-williams-rainbow-edition-review"}

It’s easy to forget how whispery-gorgeous and moving Beam’s debut,  , and the nearly-as-excellent follow-up,   were, how much they spoke to indie kids and psych-folk nerds alike, how they answered the musical question, “What if Paul Simon was a young, gentle post-9/11 dad with a four-track?” Save for the stunning epic tune “The Trapeze Swinger” from his double-album  , nothing that Beam has done since quite captured those albums’ verklempt intimacy.

As heard on her previous EP   and her new album  (both on 2MR Records), Kedrina’s spirit aligns with the pinched, analog sound of early acid house and hip-hop.

From this foundation springs  , Shabason’s first solo LP comprised of nine intimately delivered ambient jazz meditations. Jazz skeptics may already be eyeing the exits, but   is the kind of record that converts the unconvinced. Shabason’s contribution to the lively world of contemporary jazz is full of warmth and invitation; there are subdued chordal constructions from looping saxophone, airy synth layers, and sharp electric guitar crackle. A few traditional percussive elements bubble to the surface as well, like the scattered metronomic clicks on “Neil McCauley,” panning snare brushes on “Long Swim” and the ecstatic rumbles and cymbals on “Belching Smoke.” Though the music on  is experimental, Shabason’s take on the avant-garde is still firmly connected to pop; breathy saxophone lines coo in conversation with stocky synth chord progressions. Shabason has a sensitive, sophisticated ear for tonal development, suggesting a more ethereal Bill Evans, a more terrestrial Brian Eno, a less turbulent  , a contemporary to  ’s EVI invocations and a direct descendant of Donald Byrd’s transcendent   sessions. Shabason is cautious but deliberate with his application of vintage effects, and the results are reminiscent of a late 20th century film score or TV theme.

In biology, apoptosis means “programmed cell death”—i.e., organisms sacrifice pieces of themselves in the name of overall growth. For songwriter Charlie Pfaff (who takes the pronouns they and them), it’s a handy metaphor for all the small losses we suffer just for wanting to be loved. (Pfaff is into science, it seems; the lyrics to the band’s only other release, the   EP, are full of references to bugs and guts.) “I keep thinking you’ll apologize if I give it some time / If I give it some time,” Pfaff sings on “Skate Ramp.” The song is soft, raw, naked, and every note of muted electric guitar is punctuated by the sounds of fingers sliding across the strings to find their next position. Every word is murmured and echoing. “Sometimes pain brings us back to where we gotta be,” Pfaff concludes. As is often the case on  , the specifics are left to the imagination. All we really hear about is the aftermath, the wounds that won’t close. Pfaff’s intimate lyrics are frequently numbed by their semi-detached vocal delivery, sounding not so much weary as steadfast. They never scream, never linger, even when the pace quickens. On the handful of genuine rock songs on  , Pfaff’s words convey deadpan frustration and disappointment while the drums give you something to nod to. “Radio” and “Natural Things” are catchy and lovely, the former boasting a cockeyed guitar line and brittle percussion, the latter rolling along on a loping bassline. “Oats,” the record’s longest song at two minutes and 14 seconds, even shreds a little bit at the end; the song’s gently-whirling guitar line slowly growing fangs.

The soft, melodic timbre of her voice is soothing—it’s almost as if she’s trying to convince herself to follow her own advice. Those simple words, delivered in Naggar’s comforting voice, arrive at the center of a piercing, intimate tale about pushing forward, leaving behind the demons that haunt you. “If After All” is a brief, unguarded glimpse of the Montreal singer’s journey toward growth and freedom. is full of moments like this, and Naggar’s wordplay, and the forcefulness and ingenuity of her writing, give each of them a sense of urgency.

On “Devil’s Doubt,” a song about uncomfortably settling into adulthood and the sadness and wisdom that accompanies it, she gilds her sparse country with a cinematic string arrangement, adding both gravity and depth. That theatricality continues on “Lullaby,” featuring celebrated French Canadian composer . True to its name, the song is a strange, sad bedtime story, in which Naggar finds herself consciously maintaining her distance from a past love. Her haunting voice, the sparse, tinkling piano, and the soft guitar melody are blanketed in a thin layer of reverb that, much like the subject in the story she’s telling, keeps her at a distance from the listener. This is where Naggar shines, composing sonic experiments that perfectly embody the sentiments her lyrics contain. ends with the track “New Bed,” a song that’s about more than just Naggar getting new sheets. Under a veneer of static, she says goodbye to her old surroundings and her old friends, and welcomes—with some trepidation—the strangers that await in the future.

Diron wears oversized dark glasses, a black leather motorcycle jacket, and sports an enormous Afro as he boogies, jerks, and clambers over monkey bars as the infectious beat jiggles and thumps and a sax sample cycles through. “Let me see you dance!” he declares, as attractively muscled individuals of all genders bounce on trampolines, lift weights, and pose in front of mirrors. It’s sexy, eclectic, ecstatic music for freaky goofballs of every persuasion. Indeed, the title  , suggesting isolation and contemplation, is a singularly poor fit for the actual contents—though the image of Diron in full-body jumpsuit with multi-colored patches and space-age attachments is on the mark. Hailing from Angola, the singer and instrumentalist is now based in Portugal, but his music draws from everything—hip-hop, rock, disco, electronic dance music, and the Angolan dance music Kuduro. “Kema,” the album opener, starts with a sinuous melody and slides into grooving polyrhythms with electronic laser noises, with Diron and the background singers doing a call and response mixing Portuguese and Kimbundu. “Ghetto Ghetto” sounds like a somber or angry title, but there’s nothing downbeat about the track itself, with its shake-your-butt beat and Diron shouting “Ghetto! Ghetto!” in a crazed chipmunk voice, until the syllables are lost in a frantic stuttering repetition of the hard “g” sound. Other than “Don’t Stop,” the high point of the album is probably “NCrazy,” which features South African rapper Spoek Mathambo. The popping electro bass would be right at home in the early ’80s, and Mathambo spills syllables over it like a man spitting supercharged ping pong balls. “Tell me tell me tell me what the ratio / Of good time to bad / Baby, let me know!” For Diron Animal, joy bumps sadness off the dancefloor every time.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/diron-animal-alone-review"}

But a knowledge of Wand’s bleary past isn’t necessary to appreciate  ’s new beauty. The title track could be an outtake from Paul McCartney’s  : there’s a steadily-blinking piano, a roving bassline, a tangle of silvery guitar, and Hanson’s creamy tenor carrying a gently-drifting vocal melody. “Charles DeGaulle” is full of empty space; organ and guitar tumble out in tight bundles, and Hanson—sounding eerily like Thom Yorke—slips like a ghost in the vacancies between them. Even the more aggressive numbers are elegantly sculpted. The crunching “High Rise” opens with a greasy, bluesy guitar pattern, collapses briefly into cemetery silence, then the riff returns to ride the song through to its conclusion. And the grinding “Bee Karma” nicks the guitar line from “Pictures of Matchstick Men” and alternates between dreamlike verses and a big, roaring chorus. Hanson has said that the record was shaped by heartbreak, but nothing about   feels bleak or disconsolate.

That’s the question that Daphni, the dance music-minded alias of Caribou’s Dan Snaith, seems to be asking. While his main outfit has evolved from a post-rock project to a more electronically-inclined enterprise over the years, Snaith’s work as Daphni has set its sights expressly toward the dancefloor, with a particular allegiance to house music and its soulful variants in their most organic forms. Like Four Tet, a close friend and collaborator who established himself as a dance music master only after loosening up slowly, over the course of several years, Snaith’s earliest certifiable “club music” tracks had an uptightness and uprightness that have faded away. The result has been transformative, largely because the new songs exhibit a true ability to swing—to play around more freely with syncopation and entertain genre expectations that can just as easily be upended. is related to Daphni’s recent DJ-mix release  , for which Snaith created a new array of original tracks and edits to twist together into a tightly coiled sequence over an extended 74-minute spell.   presents tracks from that mix in longer versions—plus the unreleased “Vulture,” which has been passed around only by way of some of Daphni’s DJ friends. The other 11 tracks were conceived to serve their respective purposes in particular spots of the   mix, meaning that changes in speed and tweaks in volume (and so on) were integral to their duties as part of a mosaic whole. Those functional, purpose-minded aspects of the tracks are left intact to thrilling effect on   so much so that a listener can practically hear Daphni thinking out loud about the subtle shifts and mutations a DJ considers over the course of a set. “Poly” opens with a swell of synth arpeggios and cooing vocal snips that build before “Face to Face” comes on strong with drums and a bassline pared down to its essence. Adjustments in volume and dynamics abound over the course of five-plus minutes that grow funkier for all their little variations. Other tracks fluctuate in weight, and swing between big drama (“Xing Tian”) and small, slice-of-life sentiment (“Life’s What You Make It”).

Little more than a year later, the Toronto quartet returns with  , a contemplative, expertly-crafted follow-up that greatly expands the band’s sonic spectrum without abandoning their core pop punk ethos. The band has referred to their latest offering as its “Americana” record, a comparison that starts to make sense when it’s not taken literally. Indeed,   is a record that gathers disparate influences and styles, including a variety of roots-indebted sounds, and merges them into a surprisingly cohesive whole: the infectious power pop of “Walkaway,” the album’s centerpiece; the experimental jazz stylings of “Scream,” which features Tanya Tagaq; the Tom Petty-esque heartland rock of “Grass;” and the gentle bedroom folk that begins “Puddle.” OLead singer Jasmyn Burke has also sharpened her focus as a songwriter, which is most apparent on socially-conscious anthems like “Wide Open” and “Scream.” “We are living in a time when misery is just common circumstance,” she sings on the latter. “I am frozen, I’m sublime, I am searching for some fresh watermelons.” Whether they’re incorporating fresh sounds or crafting newly-inspired punk didactics, Weaves has never sounded as self-assured, or as resolutely urgent, as they do on  . —", "genre": ["Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/weaves-wide-open-review"}

It’s a taut, brutalizing beginning, and one that quickly encapsulates Melkbelly’s specific brand of intense, tightly-knit rock ‘n’ roll. If  feels instinctual, it’s for good reason. Prior to forming in 2013, all four of Melkbelly’s players had been collaborating in some form within Chicago’s DIY scene. They’re also all practically (or actually) family: vocalist/guitarist Miranda Winters is married to guitarist Bart Winters, his brother Liam Winters plays bass, and drummer James Wetzel is a longtime friend. Separately, their lists of influences and past projects run the gamut from folk-pop to punk to experimental noise. And together, they create a perfectly choreographed push and pull of twisting rhythms, anxious harmonies, and thrashing dissonance. Built on the foundation laid by their 2014  EP,   goes harder and louder. It also captures the awesome physicality of Melkbelly’s sweat-drenched live shows. Like on “Twin Lookin Motherfucker,” where Wetzel’s drumming switches between metallic beats and breakneck fills, and Miranda’s sneering-but-sweet vocals play tug of war with Bart’s fuzz-addled guitar. “Kid Kreative” finds Miranda spitting snide lyrics about getting style-jacked by a male musician, her voice gamely fighting for top billing over a rising tide of percussion. Even in the quieter moments, Melkbelly seems to thrive on sonic tension. On “Cawthra,” trembling bass parts and whispered lines about being blindfolded and “forced to stay out late” clash with bombastic choruses of mincing guitar noise. The band has said that   was inspired, at least in part, by touring around the West Coast. But in place of the wide-eyed wistfulness that usually comes with the territory, they’ve turned the tour-as-muse trope into an album full of careening stop-starts and palpable nervous energy. In other words, it’s the true sound of a sitting shoulder-to-shoulder on a too-long drive with all of the ones you love. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/melkbelly-nothing-valley-review"}

In a statement about the record, they explained, “I wrote the majority of the songs on this record thinking about what past versions of myself would’ve needed.” The album works through Denitzio’s past while reconciling it in the context of their present. “Future Me” is an affectionate note to their younger self, cataloguing the resonant traumas that contribute to their present. “I relive those years like phantom limbs,” Denitzio sings over crashing  -like guitars and fierce drums. On opener “My 85th Rodeo,” they’re sardonic in their takedown of pain: “Laugh when I hate everything!” The result of all of this is a record that’s an empathetic, representative resource for coping with trauma, identity, and change that both troubles and clarifies those two things. Most records can be contorted into personal applicability, no matter how distant they are to our reality, but Denitzio has written a sort of punk rock template with the express purpose of speaking to queer experiences.

The bands featured mostly tend toward the rock end of the spectrum, but even within that broad umbrella there is a universe of gradation. “Sage,” by The Murlocs, is a gritty, bluesy stomper, squawking guitars and greasy, back-porch harmonica smashing into loose-limbed percussion. The roaring “Damaskus ||,” by DARTS, lands like a hybrid of Modest Mouse and The National, raw-throated vocals clawing their way up a steadily-expanding musical backdrop. And “Settle Down” by the Beaches offers ample indication of why the  : the guitars arrive in thick, tight bullets, with layered vocal harmonies skating and sailing blissfully over top.

Total Giovanni pull off a kind of pop-rock disco on the revved-up Sam Weston remix of “Your Light.” Everything is sugared-up and jittery, rubberband bassline stretching and snapping over a firecracker rhythm. On their own albums, The Jezabels tend toward expansive, anthemic pop; but Aaron Harris’s remix of “Come Alive” is a miracle in the miniature, every element toned down and refined, all instruments stripped out save for a heartbeat rhythm, cloudlike electronics, and the occasional curlicue of guitar.   is a vital compilation for a crucial cause, artists from across the country banding together to fight for equality. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/arious-artists-thirty-days-of-yes-review"}

Black Emperor is to submit yourself fully to their whimsy. The Canadian band—featuring nine members, one of whom’s sole job is handling film projections at their live shows—have made a career out of mystery, shrouding any sort of personality beneath layers of post-rock haze and climactic melodic builds. The group, led by Efrim Menuck, have focused their identity on a lack of individual characters. This is a collective in the strictest sense of the word. Every moment is key, every player essential. This anti-ego is an ego in and of itself, but because the music Godspeed makes is so engrossing and powerful, any idea of individuals making these sounds cede to the greater experience of this massive organism moving as one unit. Now is perhaps the best time to be a Godspeed fan. After a legendary three-album run from 1997-2002, the group disappeared for 10 years, tending to other projects like Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra. In 2012, Godspeed reemerged fully formed, announcing   two weeks before its release date. The album, 53 minutes spread across four songs, felt like a remarkable breath of fresh air in direct contrast to our typical media consumption. The same occurred in 2015 when the band released the shorter and slightly less even  . Carrying the momentum of these two strong, late-era releases, the Godspeed album event is less like spotting Bigfoot than ever before.  is a walloping album, a concept record about how fucked we are. As the band says, “eyes up and filled with dreadful joy—we aimed for wrong notes that explode.” The record begins with some of these missed notes, as album opener “Undoing A Luciferian Towers” finds the band tuning like an orchestra whose members took too many mushrooms before the show. The delicate shriek of bagpipes enter the fold, at first beautiful and pastoral, before effortlessly shifting to something more eerie, discordant, and noisy.   is full of such moments. It’s an extremely uncomfortable album, constantly shifting and playing with expectations of the ways we expect post-rock songs to move. The album centers around “Bosses Hang” and “Anthem for No State,” each of which features three separate tracks. The latter is the album’s standout, a 13-minute scorcher that moves from delicate, contemplative isolation to full-band fireworks during its third part. “Anthem for No State, Pt. III” is a spaghetti Western thriller, the guitars perfectly twanged and the drums marching to the military beat of a zonked-out army. A Godspeed You! Black Emperor album release isn’t the Internet-stopping happening it used to be; the occurrences are too common for us to freak out with each new announcement. But that seems to be the point highlighted by their early records. Whether they’re putting out new music every two years or every 10, this band, this music, is a thing to be celebrated, slowly. We’ll see ‘em again in a few years…maybe. —", "genre": ["Rock", "Rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-godspeed-you-black-emperor-luciferian-towers"}

But you’d also be giving insufficient indication of sheer level of batshit inventiveness and wild, uninhibited originality that is standing proudly before us. The Body have complained in the past that most modern metal music is played by unimaginative musicians who are influenced solely by other metal bands. Although certainly malevolently heavy, the duo’s own output has searched for inspiration in the worlds of hip-hop, pop, Beyonc  and Depeche Mode. The follow-up to last year’s  , this is The Body’s second outing with Full Of Hell, the latter a grindcore quartet who use electronics and noise-music techniques to enhance their fierce sound. Again, the combined acts have looked outside the narrow spectrum of metal and have this time drawn on reggaeton, jungle, and free jazz. The result is an eight-track onslaught of eerie chants and whoops, playful electronic glitches, brassy madness, industrial clanking, rumbles akin to Sub Pop-era Wolf Eyes, something that sounds like the looped moan of a tugboat’s horn, unexpected moments of oddly groovy dubbiness, and even, at one point, the jaunty and crisp rattles of what might be an undead marching band. In terms of the vocals, Dylan Walker of Full Of Hell follows in the grunting grindcore tradition pioneered by Napalm Death’s Nic Bullen. In contrast, The Body’s higher-pitched Chip King sounds like the kettle has just boiled in Leatherface’s horrible kitchen.

Charles uses her voice as a be-bop instrument, bouncing around the melody: leaping up to the top of her considerable range, slowing down and then catching up.

The “Freedom” of the title doesn’t just refer to stylistic breadth; it’s also a quiet social message. On “March to Revolution Part II,” Charles wails with Grace Slick-esque stentorian power: “Will we let reason die? / When we know what we march for will we fight a revolution? / Revolution of real thought / Revolution of real mind.” Political freedom, spiritual freedom, and artistic freedom swirl around one another, part of the same picture, like the musical traditions Charles draws on. “So many songs have been left unsung,” she declaims.

Their sophomore LP,  , is a conceptual work based on the poem “Na skle maľovane.” In it, an 18th century Slovakian highwayman, Juraj Janošik, is executed in a gruesome—and kind of metal—way. He was skewered through the torso with a hook in 1713 for a series of Robin Hood-like robberies that extended throughout Slovakia, Poland, and Moravia. That backstory turns up in more than just  ’s lyrical themes and play-like intermissions: The cover art features a highwayman as he swigs from a bottle and wanders around surrounded by a field of psychotropic drugs—a great snapshot of the life of Janošik. Throughout  traditional Slovakian folk songs share space with fast-paced, straight-ahead, blazing black metal that’s loaded with traditional riffs, harsh vocals, and plenty of blistering leads. What’s so captivating about Malokarpatan’s take on black metal is the way they seamlessly blend the catchy, traditional aspects of the music into their darkened panorama. “V okresném rybníku hastrman už po stáročá vyčína” showcase Malokarpatan’s compositional skill and flat-out talent: Throughout the song’s six minutes, bluesy lead lines intersperse and overtake each blistering guitar solo, and the vocals both rise in fury and deepen threateningly.

In a way,   feels like a companion piece to Mndsgn’s great 2016 album,  , which eschewed the producer’s crate-digging aesthetic for nostalgic, danceable grooves. Here, Mndsgn’s keys and synth work have mesmerizing effects, and Ave sounds very comfortable on the beats laid out for him. Ave and Mndsgn aren’t the only stars, though: On “Steaming,” guest producers Dâm-Funk and Kaytranada fuse skittering drums and airy synths, setting the table for Ave’s drifting vocal delivery. On songs “Monitor” and “Fast Forward,” pianist Arthur Kay Piene and multi-instrumentalist DJ Harrison add delicate keys to their respective tracks. “Young Eye” is perhaps the best example of how Ave has evolved. In years past, he would’ve only relied on gritty boom-bap to present himself. But on this song, with its blaring trumpet loop and dark piano chords, Ave reminds us that, above all else, we’re all victims of societal conditioning: “Neo-Nazis marchin’ in Stockholm again though / Half of those fools caught in the Stockholm Syndrome / I ain’t making no excuses for a Nazi or defending them, but / I still ain’t seen a newborn with an emblem on.” As an artist known for his subtlety,   might be Ave’s strongest statement to date.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "underground hip hop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ivan-ave-every-eye-album-review"}

Though DJ Pierre’s origin story is the stuff of underground dance music legend, he also recorded under dozens of different names over the course of his 30+ year career. Initially arriving on the wings of Chicago house’s first wave in the mid ‘80s and forging a stylistic prototype for the sound with the trio Phuture, DJ Pierre delivered the screeching, squelching bass synth that was the signature of 1987’s “Acid Tracks.” Pierre hasn’t let up since then, and the 16-track   is a welcome sliver of high points culled from productions dating from the early ‘90s to the present.  opens with a conservative rework of “House for All,” an obscurity originally produced in 1993 by Baltimore’s Blunted Dummies. It’s followed by DJ Pierre’s lead single for the Get Physical label, the sublimely acid-drenched “MuSiQ.” It’s the third track, though—“Meet Hate with Love”—that is the rawest, most resonant reminder of DJ Pierre’s skills as a producer. Pounding at 125 BPM, “Meet Hate with Love” is definitive acid house in tone and principle. The track begins with a lone, fierce kick drum, slowly incorporating a warbling bass synthesizer, minimal piano chords, and a booming chorus sung by Ann Nesby. Tethering the sonics are astutely layered sound bites from Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Stride Toward Freedom” speech. By looping King’s instruction to “meet physical force with soul force,” DJ Pierre channels the foundational hope and virtue of house music’s classic era. The spiritual exhilaration of “Meet Hate with Love” carries on through   DJ Pierre taps into underground dance music’s promise of transcendence on tracks like “Let the Music Take You Higher” and “Love and Happiness.” Whether it serves as an introduction, or simply an update,   is an undeniable demonstration of DJ Pierre’s decades-deep artistic mastery.    ", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance", "House"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/dj-pierre-wild-pitch-the-story-review"}

Despite the fact that most of the songs stick to a pre-punk pacing, rarely exceeding mid ’60s California bop, the record’s modern fidelity helps it sidestep the “retro” tag, and Troper’s diatribes about the elite contain too much millennial sarcasm to be confused with the gripes of an earlier era. Throughout   Troper finds his sweet spot when he’s yanking from both generations simultaneously. “Your Brand” and “Big School” are the standouts, melding Phil Spector-esque majesty with Jeff Rosenstock-ish witticisms like, “Turn a tragedy into something you can work with” and “Pay to have someone reassure you that you’re smart.” Although Troper’s limited vocal range and lack of stylistic variation make for a slightly tiresome middle patch, changeups like the squeaky a cappella “Wedding” and the pulsating crunch of “Wicked” are smartly sequenced, revitalizing the listener before  ’s stellar back end. Despite what the opening song says, Troper knows that rock ‘n’ roll won’t change the world.

Starting with the growling, ominous drone loops and rapidly-accelerating pulses of “Shock,” accentuated further by Atash’s murky keen,  , split between compositions by the two musicians, is designed to cause uneasy thrills. Anyone who grew up with the throb of industrial music as part of their DNA will find much that resonates—the track “Jungle Law” especially feels like it should have emerged from a Wax Trax release somewhere in the late ‘80s, or, maybe more appropriately, Zoth Ommog a few years later. But compared to that track’s fairly straightforward approach, what’s especially intriguing about   is the way the duo twists everything to their own particular ends. Pop hooks play as quiet understatement, melodies step aside for murmuring breakdowns, brusque bass loops are offset by lingering tones hovering in the background of the mix. The duo never resort to simple brute anger, either musically or lyrically; instead, there’s a sense of tightly coiled energy that gets tenser and fiercer as it goes. Strawn’s vocals often come across as distant shouts or distorted fragments of threat and fear, but on the verses of “Instinct,” he opts for an intriguing near-croon, a compare/contrast that’s startlingly effective, his own injection of deeply human unease amidst the machinery.

Morton voices the doomed main character as he tries to navigate his condition—a situation complicated by the current political climate, which offers a compelling argument that the planet may need to be demolished before it can reset itself.

But it’s one thing to make dark music—it’s another to be immersed in the darkness.  (“Body of the Mist”), the sophomore full-length from Faroese six-piece Hamferð, is defined by the presence of death, which casts ominous shadows over practically every note. But Hamferð present metal’s obligatory preoccupation with dying in a light we rarely see it, finding melodrama, romance, and—yes—beauty in mortality.  is a story about a family shattered by the death of a child and visited by supernatural entities.

Given that all six members wear funeral tuxes when the band plays live, Hamferð (written in English as Hamferd) are certainly not above schtick. But their ability to punctuate crushing riffs and tormented death metal growls with airy sections of organ and clean singing gives their music a hymnal quality that adds a ceremonial gravity to its despair, which at times reaches such intense levels of anguish that Hamferð comes off like a goth act in disguise.

It’s followed by “Farha”—Arabic for “joy” or “pleasure”—which pits organic and electronic percussion against playful time signatures and trumpet and flute solos to create a whirling, sensual sound that finds strange stylistic bedfellows in Al Hirt and Dorothy Ashby.

Case in point: Shame, a group of 19- and 20-year-olds from south London who provide the newest and greatest argument that snarling guitars and nihilistic yelps sound best coming from those barely of legal drinking age. Their debut LP,  , is a non-stop sprint through the darker alleys of post-punk, grunge, hardcore, and even, occasionally, pop. Album opener “Dust On Trial” is ferocious, guitarists Sean Coyle-Smith and Eddie Green circling each other menacingly while singer Charlie Steen deadpans grumbling, sounding like Nick Cave on Xanax. The song’s tense and coiled opening turns out to be a bait-and-switch; the song explodes in its second half, all guts and aggression, the guitar line dive-bombing over and over again, Steen’s voice building to a rancorous snarl. That song is so good that it would be enough if the rest of   simply followed its template, but what makes the album so vital is the scope of sound the group explore. “One Rizla” is a stadium-ready anthem with group vocals, while “Donk,” which clocks in under two minutes, is pummeling, incorporating clanging, Big Black-style riffs and spastic yelps from Steen. The album ends with “Angie,” a track that crystallizes everything Shame does so well. It moves from a quiet, melodic opening section, to a slow, crawling build that wouldn’t sound out of place on an early U2 record. Steen’s voice is decidedly tender, consciously avoiding the growl he spends the previous nine tracks employing. The track’s final half moves into anthemic territory, like an Oasis B-side written during the peak of the band’s powers. It’s unlike anything else on the record, but still suits the band perfectly. This is what makes   such a startlingly strong debut: The band is confident enough to explore different sounds, but never steer too far from the blood and the guts and the grime.

Anxiety, detachment, and the mechanics of comfort play out obliquely in openers “Leave the House” and “Find Me” (“Touch my neck and walk me home / And I’ll be fine once I’m alone / Just don’t let it find me”). Maine’s lyrics draw heavily on sensory details, and are mostly inward-looking, evoking the feeling of being stuck in one’s own head. The reason   succeeds is because it contrasts these dour lyrical themes with elevating, spirited instrumentals. Throughout, Maine showcases two critical attributes: a dedication to creative growth and, as on his first two albums, prowess when it comes to composing truly gripping melodies. “Now the Water” is an instant New Romantic classic, and “Anymore” is a tranced-out near-reggaeton track, charmingly accented with autotune. These are intelligent and rewarding steps forward for Maine—steps that go even further to assure his place in the modern pop pantheon.", "genre": ["Pop", "dream pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/porches-the-house-review"}

Fans love pop surrealist details like the crotch-sucking vampire bats, incongruous clown costumes, and ubiquitous opera capes. Others are likely to find the slow-motion chases and interminable S&M softcore set pieces a chore to sit through. The soundtracks are a different matter, though. The music is a hip sexadelic mélange, veering with giddy bloodlust from pop lounge to avant dissonance and back again. Pierre Raph’s “Gilda & Gunshots” from  (1973) juxtaposes breathy female gasps with pistol blasts, strutting bass, and hepped-up percussion to create a go-go dance chase scene complete with cheekily orgasmic false starts and stops. Acanthus’s “La Chateau” from   (1971) gets into a Deep Purple-esque heavy rock groove, which dissipates into druggy atmospheric noodling before locking back in. Yvon Gerault’s quasi-Bach riff “Blue Doll Baroque” from  (1970) is a charming toccata and fugue pastiche, with the obligatory fleet final passages juxtaposed with the shuffling of chains. The most striking track, though, is François Tusques’s “Croque Weasel” from   (1968). Tusques was an important French free-jazz pianist, and the most famous composer to work on Rollin’s films. This one-minute track is bracingly abstract, starting with sawing atonal strings, and moving through plucking and piano banging; someone tries to pick up a funk beat but is subsumed by ambient crowd noise. It sounds like a mod party in a graveyard awkwardly collapsing in on itself. Another selection by Tusques, “Golden Panther,” throws an alarm clock into the middle of a Debussy arrangement. Fans of Morricone’s odder experiments will be delighted. The whole album, with its tonal shifts and unexpected stylistic detours, is an appealing evocation of all the fractured and groovy creatures of the night, even if (or maybe especially if) you haven’t ever seen a Rollin film.", "genre": ["Soundtrack"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/jean-rollin-review"}

On her 1980 debut single, her singing lunged through skittering synths, demanding attention almost immediately. Her approach to vocals—practically whispering one moment and then screaming the next—adds even more tension to her already unsettling music. Built from aging drum machines, Moritani builds upon the atmosphere she reared up on last year’s claustrophobic  Her latest album,  , takes this to the extreme. It features nothing but the sound of Moritani’s voice, often layered on top of itself or warped into new forms. In a   shared prior to the album’s release in Japan last November, she said the idea appeared around the time of her first release,  , and lingered over the next 30-plus years. Yet the impetus to finally see if she could “draw a picture by voice” came by the grind of touring, and having to lug heavy equipment with her. “So I asked myself whether I could make music solely with my own body,” Moritani writes. She retreated to a small room in her home with nothing but effects pedals and a headset mic, and created   over the course of three days. The music that emerged from these home sessions boasts some of the most disturbing noises Phew has ever evoked. Opener “Cloudy Day” finds Moritani layering syllables into a drone, which envelopes the song and gives it a persistent sense of worry. “In The Doghouse” turns out to be quite literal, with Moritani barking and whimpering like a canine (one with access to quite the effects rig) before saxophone-like wails rip across the song. But this is Moritani mutating her voice to sound like an instrument, marking  most inspired vocal transformation. While her palate has changed considerably—percussion, usually provided by dusty rhythm boxes, is absent on  , meaning the songs here lean closer to drone music—the same hair-raised-on-neck vibe presents itself on the rumbling “Just A Familiar Face,” featuring spoken word lines through layers of crackling distortion. And, it can even be funny, in a way that would make you nervously chuckle before making sure you haven’t landed in a David Lynch movie. Just check “Cloudy Day,” which builds deliriously to the moment where an un-manipulated Moritani enters to give…a brief weather report.

Their follow-up,   however, stands front and center: it delivers a powerful dose of catchy indiepop riffs and the incredibly dynamic voice of lead singer Georgia Maq. The Melbourne trio, rounded out by Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich and Sarah Thompson, belong in the genre of ultra-polished lo-fi, the vocals pressed so close to the glass edges of the song that the singer’s face is practically right in your ear. This is a good thing. Camp Cope is a female-fronted rock band who unapologetically sing about dismantling the patriarchy of the male-dominated music industry. This is not a timid list of grievances; it’s a funny and devastating testament to the fact that Camp Cope can beat the boys at their own game. “The Opener” is a withering stare in the direction of men claiming they didn’t have time to include more women on the festival bill. The lyrics are a witty screed against rampant sexism and exclusion as Maq sings, “It’s another all-male tour preaching equality / It’s another man telling us we can’t fill up the room / It’s another man telling us to book a smaller venue.” (Camp Cope seem to be quite adept at filling the room, thank you very much.) Maq then mocks the hypocrisy of men by imitating them: “Nah, hey girls, we’re only thinking about you.” But   is not just about the misogyny in the music industry, it’s about the emotional imbalance within male and female relationships. Simplistic chord progressions are comfortingly familiar (yes, Pavement tapes made their way to Australia) as the record drifts from uptempo punk to ‘90s jangle to emo basslines—but it’s Maq’s Lucinda Williams-like drawl that sets this band apart.

Every song on the album felt wide-eyed and optimistic, frontman Joe Sampson’s voice front and center in the mix, the guitars ringing brightly behind him. The mood is decidedly grimmer on  which, like its predecessor, was recorded and mixed in Sampson’s home studio. Those claustrophobic environs suit  ’s paranoid mood.

When the guitars finally enter, one minute into the song, they arrive in great, furious slashes, a far cry from  ’s church-bell pealing. The result is a record that is marvelously tense and coiled; “Psych Slasher” is aptly named, a big, roaring garage rock song that wouldn’t be out of place in the   catalogue. “Choking Sick” heaves and stutters, Sampson repeating the same two-note vocal melody over and over as the drums kick and clatter behind him. “Under the Bed” is draped in funereal synths; “Scenic Route to Nowhere” is a three-minute festival of scuzz and rattle. “Hatred,” with its open arpeggios, is the closest in tone to  , but Sampson sighs out his vocals, undercutting the spiraling guitars with a twinge of melancholy. The album’s title is appropriate—every song feels caked in gluey layers of distortion, but instead of capsizing the record, the bleariness instead makes the record feel drifting and dreamlike.

Ideas about harmonic openness, electric instruments, funk, samba, and the entire career of John Coltrane had now thoroughly infused the mainstream. That, and the ongoing concerns of black people in the United States, helped to foster a subset of sounds now loosely lumped under the umbrella of “cosmic” or “ecstatic” or, occasionally, “spiritual” jazz. This music was often energetic and aspirational, giving the impression of great possibility within lax, permeable limits. No wonder it’s having a moment again. A new compilation called   portrays that extended decade in a country where, in the wake of post-World War II American occupation, the jazz community grew enormously. In particular,   highlights independent releases never before issued outside Japan, mostly by artists who haven’t seen much international attention. There’s plenty of aggression at the start (saxophonist Koichi Matsukaze’s astringent “Earth Mother”) and finish (guitarist Kiyoshi Sugimoto’s uptempo “Long Neal”) and in between (saxophonist Takao Uematsu’s “White Fire,” kin to something like Freddie Hubbard on  ). There’s some debt to the piano textures of McCoy Tyner (pianist Tohru Aizawa’s “Dead Letter” and the Shintaro Quintet’s “A Blind Man”), two differing but convincing Brazilian-influenced numbers (bassist Eiji Nakayama’s “Aya’s Samba” and drummer Mitsuaki Katayama’s “Unknown Point”) and, curiously, no fewer than four waltz or 6/8 grooves (like the delightfully lilting “Kaze,” from drummer Takeo Moriyama). The highest-profile bandleader here, trumpeter Terumasa Hino, is featured through a 1970 collaboration with the American bassist Reggie Workman in a 15-minute one-chord jam not far removed from the plugged-in sounds, extended technique, and various fusions of 1970s New York. There’s nothing that is consciously folk-fusion about their work—no koto or shakuhachi, for instance. It is a bit of a misnomer to call it  , since plenty of pedal-point structures, ostinato vamps, electric piano, and booming bass amplification date these recordings.

Clarke’s  , which likely explains why one song is called “ৌ alien life??” (yes, that   the title). It’s an album of juxtapositions; Ferm describes   as “reflections on nighttime and dreams,” combined with ‘70s art-glam majesty. He certainly doesn’t hide the latter; opening track “Night on Earth” has the kind of spiraling-downward flow on both piano and guitar that Julian Cope once called “the glam descend,” something majestic but crumbling at the same time. Ferm’s key aesthetic trick is putting everything through shuddering layers of reverb that sound like extensions of Dave Fridmann’s production work at the turn of the millennium—think: the Flaming Lips’  , or Mercury Rev post- . Combined with its generally hazy sonics, much of  sounds like a cassette tape that’s been left out in the sun too long. The results aren’t lo-fi, but they’re far from crisp and clean; the strings on “Dreaming Still?” are precise, even when they’re swimming through clouds of appealing musical murk. Ferm’s elfin vocals, sometimes overdubbed in layers, soar around the bubbling arrangements on multi-part compositions like “premonition / ◯ / it shines through.” The title track which, at almost nine minutes, is the album’s longest number, is beautifully anthemic, Ferm combining stirring fanfares with lovely piano-led passages, and singing over the latter dreamily. Sometimes, his music’s enough in its own right; the stately sweep of “Heard Her” calls to mind the prime late-’90s Elephant 6 collective’s own psychedelic orchestrations, with just enough sonic muddiness to give it appealing grit.", "genre": ["Alternative", "shoegaze"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/holy-all-these-worlds-are-yours-review"}

It’s also an album of extremes: The anthemic vocals in “Gardener’s Prayer” call to mind Black Sabbath, while “Sight Beyond The Line” has the melodic brightness of The Cranberries, and “Billboard”’s slowly-circling vocals and taut nets of guitar could have been plucked from an early Lush album. But while   is sometimes foreboding and other times energetic, it is consistently mystical. On “It Begins With A Man,” feminist anger is delivered via ghostly, strikingly soft vocals.

The Algerian band Imarhan’s 2016 self-titled debut was a fine example of the form, with track after track of groovy, meditative riffs. Their sophomore effort, though, is a step further. The rock influences have been amped up and combined with a good bit of funk; the result is less trance, more swagger. The first track, “Azzaman” has a shoulder-shrugging, loose-limbed backbeat that you would fit right in on classic rock radio; it climaxes with a guitar solo that leans so heavy on the wah-wah it’s almost self-parodic: ridiculous and glorious at once. “Ehad wa dagh” has a tasty hook and a rhythm section racing along at punk rock speeds without breaking a sweat. “Tumast” has a slinky bottom end, walls of blazing guitar, and a vocal chorus that wouldn’t be out of place in Bollywood pop; it’s an honest-to-god desert dancefloor stomper. “Zinizjumegh” starts as a pretty acoustic number, bluesy in the spirit of folks who love both Robert Johnson and Robert Plant.

The results can get dense and chaotic, but it’s clear from the unexpectedly gorgeous first track, “My desire for you is to stop being a fuck wad,” that Graham remains in control of his source material. As goofy and frenetic as his compositions may sound, they all come together to form tight, memorable songs. On many Orange Milk releases—like Graham’s 2013 collaboration with label cofounder Keith Rankin,  —the artists use difficult sounds and an abundance of silence to make riotously fun approximations of pop or dance music. While  is further removed from pop than  is, moments like the sax “solo” and dramatic caesura in the middle of “RMB” or the propulsive second half of “Binary Tapioca” offer the structure and uplift one looks for in a great pop track.

The Montreal outfit’s mix of techno, EBM, industrial, and electro called to mind the gray soundscapes of Berlin’s electronic music underground in the ’90s, yet their take on the music felt fresh and extremely relevant in today’s grim political landscape. The fusion of Pierre Guerineau and Marie Davidson’s hard, thumping beats, and airy, eerie vocals—which were often used to decry the isolation, vices, and pitfalls of the late-stage capitalism—made for a sensual soundtrack to a dystopian world. Despite employing synth lines that sound like the aural equivalent of  , Essaie Pas still managed to maintain a tangible sense of hope. Their new album,  puts them on a slightly different path within that same journey. Heavily influenced by   Philip K. Dick’s 1977 sci-fi novel about a hellish Orange County, California of the future,   explores a world of addiction, loss, grief, and panoptic surveillance via explosive basslines, subdued synths, and distorted vocals. The album opens with “Les Aphides,” a track with a menacing bassline that, listened to via headphones, feels like it’s throbbing inside your skull. Paired with Davidson’s unsettling whispers, the song sets the mood for a record that, much like  is full of paranoid intensity. “Futur Parlé” and “Complet Brouillé” sport industrial synths and electro beats, making for the kind of music that could score an apocalyptic party scene during the climax of a sci-fi film. “Les Agents des Stups,” with its speedy synths, space-like blips, and racing hi-hats, offers a momentary reprieve, but as Guerineau points out in the album notes, this moment of relief is an illusion—the opening of a doorway that may ultimately lead nowhere.  is a dizzying, intense, and rewarding ride into an unsettling future, offering glimpses of darkness and light in equal measures.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/essaie-pas-new-path-review"}

Later, her guitar solo in “Lifer” gushes to life unexpectedly, like a tidal wave. These captivating, unsettling details serve to reinforce Wasner’s sharp portraits of malaise and self-doubt. “Oh, hard heart, do you know yourself?” she asks on “Symmetry,” echoing the opening line of 2011’s “Civilian”: “I am nothing without pretend.” If the album has a focal point, it’s “It Was Not Natural.” Over a menacing piano line that recalls Radiohead’s “A Punchup at a Wedding,” and an improbably snappy beat, Wasner discovers a treasure, “seemingly foreign, but somehow still it is familiar.” It’s a poignant summation of her unease, but it could just as easily read as the mission statement for a band that continues to evolve.", "genre": ["Alternative", "Pop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/wye-oak-the-louder-i-call-the-faster-it-runs-review"}

And while the artist born Hun Choi is known for laser focus behind the decks (sometimes intimidatingly so), he still manages to find time to twirl around the booth, eyes closed, hands in the air. His selections are both carefully placed and effortlessly dropped, blurring time in a way where speed or style matter less than uplifting energy. His special vibe in the booth carries through on his few but lauded forays into production and curation.

He includes treasured dance cuts—Larry Heard’s skittering piano jam “Burning 4 You,” and Ron Trent’s remix of Blak Beat Niks’ “Ritual of Love,” a tune that, not long ago, would run you a cool $400 on Discogs. The album comes to a close with a sprawling Detroit techno workout from Kenny Larkin’s Dark Comedy alias, another homage to Hunee’s known affinity for the often rare seminal tracks of American house and techno innovators.

Hot Snakes have always been a loud and abrasive band, but there’s a manic energy at work on their fourth album that feels unexpectedly urgent for a band who have spent the better part of the past decade-and-a-half offstage and out of the studio. On the 78-second standout “Why Don’t It Sink In?”, John Reis’s guitar sounds lethal in its barbed-wire scrape, and vocalist Rick Froberg screeches out the song’s title. A song this brief, noisy, and unrelenting doesn’t offer the listener much of a chance to let  sink in—you just endure and survive it. Much like their short, explosive songs, the first wave of Hot Snakes’ career was also brief and concentrated: three albums in five years and an unceremonious (if temporary) end, brought about by grown-up responsibilities like fatherhood. Within six years, the band slowly made their way back to festival stages, eventually followed by the unlikely reunion of Froberg and Reis’s other band, Drive Like Jehu, before Hot Snakes finally made it to the studio six years into their comeback. And it’s hard not to hear that band’s complex post-hardcore sensibility seething through the twisted time signatures and discordance of tracks like “Candid Cameras.” At its core,  bears all of the elements that made up Hot Snakes’ excellent first trio of albums: a sharp clash of guitars, pummeling punk-rock rhythms, and Froberg’s frantic, strained bark. Yet there’s even more tension and agitation than usual, even for a band whose discography is founded on that very agitation. On “Psychoactive,” the band’s wall of guitars is dense and imposing, while the churning title track evokes the nickname of German propaganda symbol in an ominous metaphor for Trump’s America: “Started as a whisper / Now it’s a campaign.” Only closing track “Death of a Sportsman” allows much space in, an ominous organ riff reminiscent of Suicide’s “Ghost Rider” rumbling under the feedback and reverb.

On their latest LP,  , they roll up all three into a weird-ass package that also includes jazz-rock, lite funk, and bits of proggy folk. If there’s a through-line here, it’s the guitar: so viscous and heavily manipulated that it’s tough to distinguish from the electric piano that’s often played alongside it. When coupled with singer Ruban Nielson’s delicate vocals, these songs feel woozy and provocative. Take “Ministry of Alienation,” where Nielson’s voice evokes a deep state of calm, until a whirring synthesizer and skronking sax bring the song to an abrupt close. A grainy, overdriven version of that same lubricious guitar sound is the foundation for “American Guilt,” a rugged stoner rock jam with witchy, pinched vocals that sound at once mocking and weary. “Hunnybee” pushes to the edge of yacht rock cheese, and not just because of the spelling: the bright, rubbery guitar slips and slides around electric key chords and tightly compressed bass; it’s basically the sonic version of a hairy chest in an unbuttoned wide-collar shirt in, say, 1978. There’s more happening here than anachronistic rock poses, though.   showcases the band’s considerable versatility: the fingerpicked acoustic guitar and multi-tracked vocals sound as assured on the stripped-down “Chronos Feasts on His Children” (an opaque reference to a Greek myth regarding the passage of time) as the lush mix of guitars and keyboards on “How Many Zeros,” or the noisy and sprawling psych workout “Major League Chemicals.” On  , Unknown Mortal Orchestra switch musical approaches so effectively that there’s no predicting where they’ll go from one song to the next.

These heavy contrasts are especially evident on “Criminal,” where the song’s heavy use of bass, drums, and vocal reverb evoke the hazier moments of Blonde Redhead.

Led by bassist and vocalist Alicia Gaines, the group effortlessly merge the unrelenting pulse of angular post-punk with the layering techniques (if not the exact sound) of shoegaze. Charlie Landsman’s guitar lines are almost freeform, bouncing and careening off the walls of the song. This interplay between the propulsive, steady foundation of Gaines and drummer Brian Cundiff’s rhythm section and Landsman’s unpredictable but precise playing give the band a feeling of both meticulous control and wild spontaneity. Swinging from skittish new wave to marauding punk and hitting almost every stop in between,   pushes out every genre it touches in novel ways, and Gaines’s severe delivery gives every song a goth-like edge, shrouding the entire affair in darkness. On “Satsuma,” an interlocking drum and bass rhythm joins up with an army of guitar lines, creating a mountaintop of sound from which Gaines yells, “What a time to be alive!” The sentiment doesn’t scan as enthusiastic leap so much as a deadpan eye-roll. Gaines deploys sarcasm with skill throughout  , managing to be cutting without ever getting too acidic; she’s not out to burn down the world, she’s out to bring it back to life.

Keeping up with the label’s cutting-edge and independent spirit, their newest compilation,  showcases the best of TRAX Records’ releases in the past decade, giving a nod to house music’s roots and steering it towards the future. The compilation opens with Carmelo Carone’s “Chicago (Original Mix),” a classic four-to-the-floor anthem with sultry vocals that transport you directly to the bump and grind of a lit up dancefloor. Along with Lois Plugged and Fruckie’s “Gotta Have House,” both tracks serve as superb primers to Chicago house history, the latter consisting of a spoken word track underscored by 4/4 beats detailing the spirit and significance of the Warehouse club parties.  also gives due representation to the Latinx influence in the music’s heyday with Ckrono’s proto-dembow, body-slamming track, “Toma.” The compilation also features Screamin’ Rachael’s signature punk howl in standout tracks like “The British Are Coming” and “Spirits Rising,” the latter feeling like a high octane seance—Screamin’ Rachael conjuring the spirits of dance to take us on a magical tour through late-night bliss under the light of a thousand disco balls. is probably the most fun you’ll ever have connecting the dots between house music history and the sights and sounds that inspired (directly or indirectly) all of your current favorite DJs and producers. It’s also one of the most ingenious and inspiring ways for TRAX to reframe current conversations about house music and to, hopefully, reintroduce that raw, rudimentary vibe into current house music production.  reminds electronic music fans of the communities that made house what it is today.", "genre": ["Electronic", "House", "breaks"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-various-artists-now-thats-what-i-call-trax-volume-1"}

The projects, originally dropped in 2013 and 2016 respectively, showcase the chemistry between Blu’s elegant and worldly lyrics, and Nottz’s beats, which combine crackling kicks and snares with melodic flourishes. Remastering and re-sequencing the songs into an album format elevates   into a nourishing, well-rounded listen that conveys Blu’s inner feelings as they relate to the broader religious and political systems surrounding him. The album rolls into life with “Atlantis,” which previously closed out the  EP Over gently bubbling production, Blu takes stock of the world, free associating everyday scenes like a working mom dropping her kids off at school, and then witnessing a politician fumbling his lines on TV. This moment prompts an expansive life view: “I changed the channel / There’s a window in my living room / I like to travel.” The next run of songs ramp up the intensity. Nitty Scott contributes a fiery hook to the raucous “Boyz II Men,” while Blu delivers righteous braggadocio. The heavyweight “Crooks in Castles,” which co-stars Homeboy Sandman and Sene, maintains the fierce atmosphere, before the bass-thick “Giant Steps” begins a move to a more contemplative production vibe. On “The Truth,” a bed of static underpins Blu’s musings on science, religion, and personal destinies. The previously unheard “Yesterday” closes   on a poignant note. A melancholy mirror to the opening optimism of “Atlantis,” Blu brings the album full circle as he chisels his parting words into the track while smartly nodding to the project’s history: “It’s kinda like living tomorrow without a yesterday.”", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/blu-nottz-album-of-the-day"}

The mysterious solo Italian recording project—self-described as “100% Synthesized, 100% Dehumanized” on social media—shares the kind of chugging rhythms, blasting percussion, and precise arpeggios favored by the pioneering metal guitarist. But MASTER BOOT RECORD does all of that it minus guitars and plus a lot of 1s and 0s, adding a healthy diet of bleeps and bloops that will sound instantly familiar to students of 1970s and ‘80s arcade games. That combination—menacing metal and glittery game sounds—is something unique, similar to early Daft Punk’s marriage of vocoder, techno, and disco sounds. MASTER BOOT RECORD has built a cult following for its prolific and recognizable sound over the past two years, releasing both original music (with album and song titles that function as easter eggs for programmers and computing hobbyists) and covers of classic video game themes. But unlike previous releases, new LP   finds MASTER BOOT RECORD collaborating with a vocalist—the unpronounceable French singer Öxxö Xööx, from Blood Music labelmate Rïcïnn—and further expanding the project’s sonic palette. The vocals meld nicely, and range from tuneful (“DMA 2 FDD CONTROLLER”) to beastly (“DMA 4 CASCADE”). The guest spot, along with the signing to an established Finnish metal and electronic music label, should help cement MBR’s street cred. But even the new album’s instrumental tracks, like the operatic and ever-shifting opener “DMA 0 DRAM REFRESH” contain a new sense of structural adventure. On one hand, these are absolutely perfect songs for driving confounded parents insane. But between the project’s musical complexity and its absolute confidence in pioneering an aesthetic that feels more developed with each new release, MASTER BOOT RECORD is just as compelling as it is mysterious.

Thanks to now long-established members Rachel Travers on drums and Peter Lightning on guitar, Wax Idols have done something other bands similarly indebted to ‘80s post-punk and goth haven’t: write a record that finds strength in simply being alive, however dark the shadows might be. It’s audible from the start, with the lead-off track “Heaven Knows” smartly showcasing nearly all the group’s core qualities. Fortune’s vivid, strong voice matches instantly memorable music that combines pop catchiness with dark undertones, squealing and shattered guitar riffs with tense, powerful drumming. The following track, “Too Late,” soars like something out of the Psychedelic Furs catalog; while its lyrics speak of loss, the song itself pushes forward relentlessly, mirroring the album’s spirit of determination. “Belong,” built around a bass riff by Travers and fleshed out by the band, has the nerviness of a prime Cure single, a tangle of guitars tripping across a locomotive bassline. In recent  , Fortune has spoken about weathering deep, personal losses and, accordingly, the lyrics on   address separation, regret, and despair. The album’s closing song, “Missed Call,” is a spare Fortune solo performance that speaks of missed connections and sad farewells. But as the song goes on, it becomes about something more—Fortune begins recalling shared memories with an unnamed friend on the other end of a phone call. “I don’t blame you for anything,” she sings, “some people they just drift away never knowing that they’re lost.” It mirrors much of  : life is difficult, painful things happen but, ultimately, peace is possible.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/wax-idols-happy-endings-review"}

Newly signed to legendary Pacific Northwest label Kill Rock Stars, on this release the Portland, OR-based band deliver 12 biting, crisp tracks in just under 30 minutes.

Hornor’s lyrics, filled with Gertrude Stein-esque half-thoughts and repetitions, evoke lonely, fractured scenes: “No place to call your own / When you are all alone,” she sings on “Home.” Although Lithics does dissonant, experimental punk well, some of the best tracks dive into distinctly more melodic territory, particularly on the latter half of the album. The sing-song vocals and dueling guitar lines of “Edible Door” bring to mind   in their  era. This sonic shift may signal more of what the band has been striving for. In an interview last year, bassist Bob Desaulniers said he considered their efforts to be more pop-oriented these days. “I’d rather be a kind of harsh pop band than trying to be some badass punk band and not really succeeding at that,”   in an interview with Portland alt-weekly  .

That image sums up   glimpses of natural life amidst an increasingly urbanized world. Space Ghost’s previous effort, 2015’s  , was an attempt to translate the natural environment into electronic sound.

Songs like “Eyes Closed” and “Peace Lily Garden (Part II)” recall the work of Dâm-Funk, with smooth melodies played on vintage synths. Often, he tempers this reverence for Dam’s glimmering suites with propulsive house rhythms (e.g., “Endless Light”). The slapping “Strong Heart” employs percussion that sounds like it was imported from early Too $hort. But while     makes a break from the sound of  —soft synths, serene melodies—Space Ghost still finds room for recordings from the natural world, like the faint chirping of birds on “Dreamer” or the sound of trickling rain on “After Hours While It Rains Outside.” These gentle touches, and the warmth of the analog synths, make   equally suited for lounging in dimly-lit clubs or commuting to work on a blindingly sunny day.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/space-ghost-endless-light-review"}

Less than 15 seconds into  , the New York band’s seventh album and first effort in three years, vocalist Sherwood “Thunder Wheel” Webber IV pins us down by the throat as well as the eardrums, and issues growled death threats. “You have brought upon yourself our savagery!” he roars, his compatriots’ stabbing riffs creating a frenzied fugue. “Die! Die! DIE!

There’s certainly more than enough of this “love” to go around on  . A 10-track abomination fashioned from Tampa death metal’s chugging grooves, Bay Area thrash’s anthemic slams, Norwegian black metal’s atmospherics, and New York hardcore’s curb-crushing breakdowns,   stands as Skinless’ strongest, most cohesive effort in years. Stompers like “Skull Session” and “Exacting Revenge” serve up satisfying slabs of the dank red meat fans have come to expect, their preexisting heft rendered all the more fearsome thanks to the cavernous mix of producer Dave Otero (Primitive Man, Cattle Decapitation, Cephalic Carnage). As always, the band’s scorched-earth approach isn’t quite as all-encompassing as it seems; “Medieval” and “Cruel Blade of the Guillotine” throw folk guitars and ambient effects into the mix, lending Skinless’ hellish topography dynamic nuance—and even greater power.", "genre": ["Metal", "Death Metal"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/skinless-savagery-review"}

His work as Prefuse 73 is packed with ideas, overflowing with guest vocalists and innovative electronic techniques. Since leaving Warp Records in 2011 after  , Herren has begun to pull back the layers, examining the details of what makes his music so enthralling, extracting small pieces from the mix and allowing that minutiae to become the focal point. His latest LP,  , is built on this idea, and its songs consist of patient loops, beautiful melodies, and meditative moments of quiet. The album begins with “New Salad Intro,” a song where vocal snippets are screwed and manipulated, cymbals are washed in ambient noise, and buzzing synths never quite bubble above the surface. The song is a multitude of pieces, and a sign of things to come. And while the song never fully coheres beyond this collection of disparate noises,  is at its best when otherwise unrelated ideas find harmony amongst each other. “Late to the Party” pairs a sweetly lilting melody with harsh piano stabs, looping back upon itself again and again. The result is surprisingly peaceful, a subtle consideration of just how many parts are needed to make a whole. “Gravure” opens with ominous tones and grave percussion before diving into Shlohmo-esque synth manipulations. “The World is Bigger” is the album’s longest and most boisterous track, yet it doesn’t seek out terrain too far past its origin point. And while  may be Prefuse 73’s simplest album to date, it’s in this stripped-down aesthetic that Herren gets to the heart of what the project is all about. The elements are spread across a canvas for the listener to take in individually, one by one.

The album was full of colorful lyrics about rebelling against the 9-to-5, staying home from the party, and the mirage of domestic bliss, all delivered in Barnett’s trademark chill drawl. “Now we’ve got that percolator / Never made a latte greater / I’m saving 23 dollars a week,” she sings on “Depreston,” one of the record’s many standout tracks. Now, countless tours, one Kurt Vile collab album, and a lifetime of socio-political turmoil later, Barnett’s latest,  , seems to build on that foundation while heaping the weight of the last three years on its maker’s shoulders. The record opens with “Hopefulessness,” a slow-building number that plainly lays out her thesis statement: “Take your broken heart / Turn it into art,” she sings as her guitar grows more insistent. That song ends with the screech of a kettle whistle and, in a lot of ways,   is the sound of Barnett reaching her boiling point. On “Nameless, Faceless,” Barnett echoes the #MeToo movement, loosely adapting the Margaret Atwood quote “Men are scared that women will laugh at them / Women are scared that men will kill them” around a line about how Barnett walks through the park at night while holding her keys between her fingers. It’s followed by the feedback-filled “I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch,” in which Barnett channels her inner Karen O to wail that she can “only put up with so much shit.” Ultimately, though, it’s the way Barnett juxtaposes these moments of colossal rage that makes   so monumental. “Need A Little Time” offers a refreshingly honest look at intimacy and self-doubt. “Help Your Self” delivers a message of hopeful empowerment almost in spite of itself. And then there’s the sprawling album closer “Sunday Roast,” which feels most akin to her work with Vile, and features what is maybe the record’s most poignant line. “Some kindness goes around / Some kind of backfires,” Barnett sings, revealing just how revelatory simple goodness can be—especially when it feels like the world is crumbling around you.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/courtney-barnett-tell-me-how-you-really-feel-review"}

Like a young argonauta, Burns herself is caught in “a strange chasm in my life,” as she says in the album notes, and  finds her grappling with the loss of her mother while, at the same time, she discovers true love. The album’s brilliance stems from her ability to navigate these two emotional poles with grace, highlighting the strange ways in which grief can manifest itself. Burns, originally from Austin and now living outside of Boston, released her first album,  , in 2013. The arrangements were spare, leaving plenty of room for her voice to exert control, winding and soaring with ease. Yet  takes her vocal prowess to a new level—more confident and operatic. She evokes Thom Yorke’s plaintive cry on standout tracks like “I Thought I Knew You Well” and “Would You Come To Me”; occasionally, she delivers the album’s most poignant messages with an air of almost stately detachment, bringing to mind the German cult singer Nico, acting as a foil for the rich string arrangements, equally cinematic and mournful, that share space with her cutting acoustic guitar. Burns’s songs don’t follow conventional structures, and their open-ended nature reflects her tendency to ask more questions than give answers. “Oh, won’t some otherworldly joy / Please step on in?” she pleads in one of the album’s most climactic moments, on closing track “Where Do I Begin.” Steeped in pain, it’s hard to not also hear, in the line, Burns’s sheer awe of the world around her.", "genre": ["Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/aisha-burns-argonautica-review"}

Parks had taken up the violin in the fourth grade and, perhaps bolstered by a lack of extended formal training, she’s used her intuition to craft an elegant and abstract style of play. In an interview with the  , Sudan Archives described the way she plays violin as decidedly “un-Western,” recounting the inspiration she found in the folk sounds of Sudanese players. She often forgoes the use of a bow, sometimes slapping her instrument like a djembe drum, strumming it like a banjo, or plucking a riff with her fingers. In 2017, after cautiously exploring the vibrant and amorphous L.A. beat scene, Parks released her debut EP for Stones Throw Records. On  , she grafted her violin style onto a batch of glitchy, soulful electronic tracks, and sang on all of them. Her new EP,  , continues the lo-fi electronic folk awakening she explored on her debut and extends the scope of her songwriting. Many of the songs on   are muggy, but the title track sounds like it’s literally underwater. Cavernous, echoey synths float and flutter while Parks’s singing voice is shrouded in breathy distortion. “Nont For Sale” is the lead single and obvious album centerpiece. It’s boomy, spaced-out R&B on which elastic staccato trickles above the beat. Despite her upending of a classical instrument, the artist’s music is held together by a strong center of gravity. She sounds remarkably assertive and radically independent. “This is my light, don’t block the sun,” Parks declares in a sneering taunt. “This is my seat, can’t you tell?” The song “Beautiful Mistake” sounds quaint by comparison, with a tick-tock drum unraveling in a crooked gallop while Parks plucks a tip-toeing riff. “  describes the way I want my music to make you feel,” Parks says in an artist’s statement about her new EP. “It’s inspired by my love of fluidity, movement of jellyfish, and water.” For an artist still discovering her talents, Parks sounds comfortable gliding from one sound to the next.  ", "genre": ["Experimental", "Soul", "Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/sudan-archives-sink-album-review"}

One of the most crucial of these has been slowness. In dubstep’s half-step lurch, experimental electronica like Andy Stott and Arca, alt-R&B, post-FlyLo beat-scene psychedelics, Berlin techno’s retreat from pounding extremes—even the reggaetón-influenced mainstreaming of tropical house—there was a retreat from the idea of beat as “driving” and into looser, more limber relationships between drum programming and dancers’ bodies. One of the most interesting crucibles for this experimentation has been a half-tempo zone in drum & bass. Artists like dBridge, Om Unit, Sam Binga, Japan’s ENA, and San Diego’s ASC have in various ways opened up d ‘n’ b’s spaces and saved it from the harder-faster-denser sonic arms races that drove some of its variants into an evolutionary dead end. ASC has taken those lessons and started applying them to other templates. Having spent his last two albums on entirely ambient drones, he’s now exploring a place completely between genres—using the same moody sound palette as his previous records, but going across the tempo range, and crucially using patterns of three beats, rather than the 4/4 patterns of 99.99% of dance records. Oddly, despite this unorthodox rhythmic approach, the record sounds strangely familiar: the tonality, the flow, the bodily impact of the sub-bass, all echo early dubstep, Drexciya-style Detroit electro, and ASC’s own half-step d ‘n’ b. Yet as you get absorbed into the swirling waltzes, they will take you to strange, intergalactic places.

The simple swing of the music recalls  era   or David Bowie’s “Absolute Beginners.” “You will not be awake for long / You won’t have to wait for long,” sings Hval, initiating a subtle yet anthemic refrain that repeats throughout the track, sometimes mutating with respect to pronoun (“you” vs. “we”) and whether her voice is single or multi-tracked. Like “Absolute Beginners,” “Spells” ends up feeling both triumphant and intimate, both timeless and, in its rhythmic consistency, endless. Hval doubles this sense of endlessness, too, by having her refrain pour over into the second song of the EP. There, her now-familiar vocal line serves as a hinge between two distinct compositional segments (a sparse piano ballad and a jittering mass of vocals), facilitating a conversation between them. Conversation has long been central to Hval’s music. Many of her songs stage actual or imagined dialogues between human characters or broader entities. Yet where previous Hval releases, such as 2016’s  , employ direct modes of address—loaded language, narrative specificity, audio-visual doubling—  presents conversations that, like the music itself, are a little more spaced out and abstract. There are “you”s and “me”s, but the nature of their relationships tends to drift into the atmosphere, like Hval’s soaring voice on “Spells.” They exist—to use a lyric from that song—“in the smallest great unknown.” On the short, spoken final track, Hval appears to analyze her own songwriting approach: “There is nothing useful in the way we define you or me in this context,” she says, later adding, “It’s not in the words.” Indeed, the interactions throughout the EP are open-ended, staged within the recordings—the multi-tracked vocals, track two’s sparring ideas—rather than in the text. The EP’s nearly 11-minute title track removes language altogether. Its few vocalizations are quiet, wordless, fragmented, floating in a formless and diverse stream of sound: the most palpable aural manifestation of that “great unknown.”", "genre": ["Experimental", "Folk"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/jenny-hval-the-long-sleep-review"}
{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0026198783_2.jpg", "album": "Childqueen", "artist": "Kadhja Bonet", "description": "At the beginning of her latest album,  , Kadhja Bonet offers an invocation for the LP to follow: “Every morning brings a chance to renew.” It’s an apt sentiment for her sophomore release. Her voice flutters, regal as the flutes and parade of drums behind it, like a movement that is equal parts hymn and march. The Los Angeles artist isn’t afraid to challenge her listeners as much as she does herself; when she sings of renewal, it could just as easily apply to the rebirth that happens from song to song. Each song highlights different elements of her seemingly boundless artistic impulses. “Delphine,” for example, creeps along a plodding bassline as Bonet’s soulful vocals—wispy falsetto blues lullaby with thoughtful lyrics—command the space, while “Joy” features a brief angelic chorus that gives way to a striking bed of strings and woodwinds. The former is a testament to her gorgeous vocal abilities, the latter to her impeccable musicianship. Though the spirit of Minnie Riperton’s legendary soprano is felt throughout  , it’s perhaps no more vivid than on lead single “Mother Maybe,” an elegant meditation on the divinity of feminine power. “You’re the deep and secret sea,” Bonet sings, “acquiesce in colors siphoned from the love that is me.” On the song’s back half, Bonet ascends to her whistle register, climbing steadily to a piercing and gorgeous crescendo.

As expansive as it is exuberant,  imbues tales of loneliness, passion, and despair with a healthy dose of hilarity, resulting in songs that are both immediately recognizable as her own, and also mirror the complex world we all inhabit. is clearly Case’s vision—she handled the album’s production, as well—but she’s enlisted a murderer’s row of collaborators to help her realize it: k.d. lang, Laura Veirs, A.C. Newman, and Screaming Trees’ Mark Lanegan all make appearances. Yet instead of coming across as scattershot or overly busy, the collective effort gives  the feel of a zany, extended family vacation; even when she’s digging into the depths of her own misery—as on the album’s sprawling centerpiece, “Curse of the I-5 Corridor”—Case and company can’t help but saturate these songs with sunny arrangements that belie the lyrics’ harsh realities. “Halls of Sarah” describes a wounded and absent companion, but does so over a honeyed guitar figure and the sort of magnetic melody Case favored with frequent collaborators the New Pornographers; later, “Bad Luck” boasts a radiant chorus that’s deliberately at odds with its dour sentiment. That balance of playfulness and tragedy has run consistently through Case’s work, but on   she has sharpened her wit to a dagger’s edge. On the title track, God appears as a “lusty tire fire”: “I cried so hard I pissed myself,” she sings over a glam-y groove on “My Uncle’s Navy.” The line “I fucked every man that I wanted to be,” from “Curse of the I-5 Corridor,” is as multilayered as it is acerbic. Perhaps some of this saltiness can be credited to Case’s recent run-in with tragedy; as has already become something of lore, her Vermont home burned down during the album’s completion. But frankly, it may have more to do with her singular ability to examine her own complexity with an unflinching and imaginative gaze.

Even when PKP was more or less a bedroom project, Hanlon showed a knack for crafting punk songs that came across as lightweight while belying a fierceness and discipline that the thick layers of lo-fi gloop on her first few releases couldn’t entirely obscure. Peach Kelli Pop come into their own as a band on their fourth full-length,  The record features the contributions of bassist and guitarists Gina and Sophie Negrini (who also play in Hanlon’s live band) and drummer Andrew Bassett of the Mean Jeans, which give   a sonic fullness that Peach Kelli Pop lacked when it was just Hanlon bashing away in her bedroom. But this is still Hanlon’s show. It’s her vibrant personality that powers   forward with the same high-octane energy, unapologetically girlish aesthetics, and gummy hooks that have distinguished Peach Kelli Pop from the beginning.  doesn’t deviate PKP’s established formula of keyed-up, rainbow-hued pop-punk songs, but it does sharpen its edges. Studio polish removes the fuzz that once muted the band’s hooks, and the newfound clarity allows every facet of PKP’s tightly coiled sound to sparkle in the light of Hanlon’s exuberant presence.   also features some of Hanlon’s strongest songwriting to date, showing a transition from basic garage rock structures to more sophisticated arrangements rooted in the indie pop school of punk, a natural fit for her growing musicianship. The band dives right in with “Hello Kitty Knife,” a giddy celebration of self-care and self-defense played breathlessly fast with guitar tones so bright they stop just short of screeching. Propulsive earworm “Black Magic” takes its cues from power pop, but sports more than a hint of Heavenly in its lyrics. Hanlon dials down her hyperactive energy on several tracks, including the adorable “King Size,” a tender song about a pit bull with a heart of gold (one of two songs about animals on  ). As a lyricist, Hanlon’s outlook is positive—“Don’t Push Me” is the closest she gets to a straight-out rebuke on the entire record—but PKP is a punk band, and the best songs on   have a kind of self-aware cheekiness that dares you to dismiss them as novelty. “Cherry (That’s Not Her Real Name)” is peak Peach Kelli Pop, a vivacious bubblegum gem that’s the perfect blend of tart and sweet, the band spinning around manically around on three cheerful chords. Add in a pitch-perfect Marine Girls cover, and   positions Peach Kelli Pop as the latest star in a firmament of female-fronted punk bands whose soft exterior packs a hard punch.", "genre": [], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/peach-kelli-pop-gentle-leader-review"}

It’s a confusing and beautiful ride, and the Swedish band Echo Ladies perfectly master it with their synth-and-distortion-heavy-pop sound on their debut album,  Throughout eight tightly composed tracks, the Malmö trio—formed by Matilda Bogren, Joar Andersén, and Mattis Andersson—effortlessly craft a strange dream space with a sound that draws from ‘90s shoegaze pioneers like Slowdive and Ride, goth stalwarts like The Cure, and more recent fuzz-pop acts like Dum Dum Girls, but transcend their influences to present something unique. begins with a bombastic note via its opening track “Intro,” but the album quickly moves to subtler terrain, with songs that feature beautiful and melancholic synth textures, echo-filled percussion, and bass lines reminiscent of New Order’s 1985 album  , which the band cite as a major reference for their sound. Those textures, along with the creative use of shoegaze genre staples such as droning guitars, lots of echo, delay, and distortion, and Bogren’s thin, melodious vocals make for a hazy listen, meant to evoke nostalgia for a youth long past and a weary worry for what the future might hold. The lead single “Bedroom,” for example, is a chaotic blend of staccato drumming and euphoric synths, as Bogren dreamily sings about the freedom of loneliness and the complete madness that can come along with it, while tracks like “Almost Happy” and “Apart” are delicate and heavily distorted ballads about love and longing, that progress slowly but pack a punch to the gut. With  Echo Ladies take us on a journey through the intricate, epic emotions that make the fabric of our youth and the melancholy of leaving them behind for the uncertainties of adulthood.  feels like listening to a soundtrack for the end of an era, where mourning paves the way for new light.", "genre": ["Pop", "shoegaze"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/echo-ladies-pink-noise-review"}

Yet on her first release for a label,  , the 18-year-old, self-produced Los Angeles musician hana vu throws caution to the wind, dipping her toes into murky R&B in the vein of King Krule (“Cool”), woozy jangle-pop (“426”), and even writing one of the best post-rock gloom jams this side of Interpol’s  (“Shallow”). Threaded through the entire project is vu’s remarkable knack for melody; armed with a dazzlingly confident voice, these songs are all clearly  , even if they explore radically different musical territory. Not only is vu assured, but she tackles questions of self-reliance and emotional insularity with a maturity far beyond that of your average high school student. There are nods to dissolving romance; on “Crying on the Subway” (perhaps the first song to be written about L.A. public transit) for instance, she captures the complex push and pull of ending a doomed relationship, incorporating a slinking bassline and skittish drum machines that magnify the poles of her mixed emotions. Later, on the EP’s title track, she delivers a bold statement of her own independence, backed by nothing but a gravelly guitar figure: “I ran the world / I’ve heard it all / Doesn’t get me very far.” Even though hana vu seems like she’d rather stay within the confines of her room, she’s made clear that she’s eager to tackle a world’s worth of sounds and experiences.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/hana-vu-how-many-times-have-you-driven-by-review"}

Now a quartet augmented by bass, drums, and keyboards, Patterson’s group currently hews closer to the shades-tightly-drawn cinematic stylings of Nick Cave and Mark Lanegan. Produced by David Lynch’s long-time music supervisor, Dean Hurley, Jaye Jayle’s latest full-length,  starts with an instrumental aperitif: “No Trail (Path One)” is driven by overlapping piano (and, later, keyboard) ostinatos that tumble together as if in a clothes dryer. Up next is the hypnotic, dirge-like “No Trail (Path Two).” This song introduces Patterson’s baritone, as stark as spilled black ink pooling on paper, before Emma Ruth Rundle joins in to add even more shade to the vocal fray. “What took you so long?” she whispers, in a tone that’s both conspiratorial and frightened. The rest of   follows the same blueprint of mesmerizing unease. Minor-key guitars add macabre heft to insistent rhythmic pulses, shirred keyboard grooves, and scattered instrumental atmosphere. The clattering backdrop of “Ode To Betsy” echoes that of Bauhaus’ “Bela Lugosi’s Dead”; “Low Again Street” is bookended by foggy, diffracted saxophone; and “As Soon As Night” boasts recurring whirring sounds that resemble a power drill. The album’s emotional and musical highlight, however, is the tension-filled “Marry Us.” Another example of fine vocal interplay between Patterson and Rundle, who are a couple in real life, it’s a searing psychedelic sprawl with well-placed percussion (i.e., raindrop-like beats, devious tambourine shakes) and lyrics smoldering with desire. “Marry us / We don’t need anyone / We don’t need family / Just marry us, now,” Patterson demands. The desperation in his voice increases as he urges that the deed be done “quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly”—words spoken just as loud, crashing guitars surge, as if they’re placing a firm exclamation mark on his exhortation. As this song underscores,  is a bold step forward for Jaye Jayle, an album that sears the heart without even trying.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/jaye-jayle-no-trail-and-other-unholy-paths-review"}

Aside from being ageist, it is also couldn’t be further from the truth. Take someone like Kim Gordon, for example. At 65, the ex-Sonic Youth member is making some of her most experimental music to date with Body/Head, her collaborative guitar-based project with Bill Nace. Nace and Gordon may only present half the number of tracks that appeared on their 2013 debut,  , but they manage to stretch them out into new realms on  . There’s a fundamental sparseness to this album, one that takes a step even further back from their minimal, abstract debut and allows space to swish around with potency. Opener “Last Time” begins like an Earth song, but rather than head into crunchy guitar overdrive and rumbling drones, the pair embrace the power of restraint, thoughtfully stepping in and out of each other’s guitar parts like ballroom dancers. Tone is crucial, and they allow guitars to whirr and hum with static hiss; the eerie, woozy,  -like ambience on “In the Dark Room” creates a presence that is alternately immersive and distancing. Gordon’s vocals wail under a sea of ever-shifting guitar feedback on “Change My Brain,” and the closing “Reverse Hard” bubbles away with a quiet force, as though faraway sounds are creeping in through a window that has been left open, shifting from remoteness to claustrophobia.

While compilations are nothing new for Erased Tapes, this release is more of a collaboration than a simple collection of unrelated tracks.

Erased Tapes is known for housing brilliant piano-based artists, and this album makes a lovely introduction to them.

The album begins with vocalist Rebecca Valeriano-Flores hollering in a ridiculous faux British accent, “Is there anybody there?” The response comes in the form of a lightly-overdriven guitar, which plunges into the empty space with brash, simple bar chord hammering, propped up with snare and kick. That combination lays the sonic and thematic groundwork for  , which flits between levity (“You’re picking sides like you pick your nose!” Valeriano-Flores sneers on the title track) and gravity (“In the city there’s 10 million men in uniform and they got a right to kill,” she howls on “10 Million Kids”). Negative Scanner excel at relaying these bite-size sentiments in tight, succinct blasts that rarely run more than two minutes. The record is efficient and poppy, with elevated BPMs and power-pop inclinations, but it’s bitter enough to balance the sweetness thanks to its proudly unpolished production and Valeriano-Flores’s idiosyncratic vocal style. On “The Only One,” backed by Matt Revers’s driving guitars, Nick Beaudoin’s chugging bass, and Tom Cassling’s no-frills drumming, Valeriano-Flores trudges along in a resigned low register, while her roars on “Let It Die” recall the no-quarter delivery of Downtown Boys’ Victoria Ruiz. “A Vision” splits the difference, trading off between indifferent, machine-like baritone and enraged yells.  straddles a fence between twisted power pop and catchy post-punk in the vein of contemporaries like Vancouver’s Dumb and Portland’s Lithics.

The debut studio LP from  —aka Oakland, California’s Megan Mitchell—spins operatic whirlpools of sound into oceans of whispery drones. Urgency is in very short supply here; the predominant vibe here is drift. At times, it can be difficult to understand what Mitchell is actually  ; her diction is often overcome by feeling, and her malleable voice is one among many of the album’s sonic colors. On “Malaise Vague,” her voice is brought to the fore. The instrumental itself is drawn back and minimized, and there’s a sadness to her tone that feels like Enya in mourning. “Soporific Return,” by contrast, is lighter, with Mitchell’s languorous enunciations swimming through echoing, bell-like electronics. The tremulous “To Ward” is a vigorous remix or two away from being something that could fit comfortably on a playlist alongside  ’s  an immersive, trippy album in its own right. Standout “Render Arcane” is buoyed by a fleet, intricate percussive matrix that nudges  , however briefly, towards the world of house music, suggesting one avenue the project could take in the future. Another possibility turns up on album closer “Intent to Vacate,” where the backdrop darkens into something rhythmic, monstrous, and groaning, while Mitchell’s voice, strident and strong, pulls away.

The group return to that theme again and again across the album’s 14 tracks, picking apart our collective obsession with technology. Lyricists Ben Hozie and Nikki Belfiglio use deliberately mundane and unembellished language to conjure mundane and unembellished characters and settings, and their portrait of the modern age is unpretentious and all too realistic—often hilarious in its scorn and exasperation. The first moment of  ’s winkingly-titled second track, “Bodega Birth,” states the album’s thesis: “I use my computer for everything / Heaven knows I’m miserable now.” In both its content and its monotone delivery, the line addresses the ways our technological access leads to a kind of internal deadening. “Bookmarks” is even more direct: “All day at work / Stare at computer/ Come home from work / Stare at computer,” drilling down on the banality of constant access. It’s not all screens, though: On opener “How Did This Happen?!,” BODEGA lament how technology has led to political complacency and “slacktivism”; “Can’t Knock The Hustle,” with its quips about nine-dollar smoothies and hourly salaries—and a sardonic chorus that goes, “You can’t knock the hustle / When the cats are making capital”—is an anti-capitalist anthem that socialist organizations could adopt as their fight song. Such straightforward lyricism demands music that’s equally unflashy, and BODEGA’s simple, wiry arrangements rise to the occasion. The songs are built from little more than slightly overdriven guitars, simple, driving drums, and Belfiglio and Hozie’s yelped vocals.

Certainly, there’s been a move from many people in the club world into producing purely textural music, the kind that feels like a bath for the soul. The template has been set by the   collective in London, with a whole set of musicians from in and around the London bass world making songs that are unapologetically blissful and New Age-inspired. Now, Arthur Cayzer, who records as Pariah, has followed a similar trajectory, moving from dubstep and grime to enveloping beatlessness on his latest release,  . Formerly a punk and hardcore musician, seduced by dubstep into making complex bass-heavy electronic constructions, and latterly the producer of austere techno as half of Karenn with Jamie “ ” Roberts, he apparently hit a bout of writer’s block before realizing that he could solve his problem by ditching his drum machines and letting these airy concoctions flow over, under, and around the block. The opener, “Log Jam” perhaps describes that creative block itself: it’s the one piece on this album that feels solid and weighty, its intense chords chugging like turbocharged Steve Reich. After that, there are two modes: tracks like “Pith,” “Conifer,” and “Here From Where We Are” float suspended on sustained chords, as if willing time to a standstill. The rest of the album is airborne, tumbling on eddies of arpeggio, reminiscent of the 1970s ambience of Steve Hillage’s  , or the ‘90s space exploration of Pete Namlook and  ’s  . Just as with the New Atlantis output, there’s no edge to this, no irony: plenty of emotional depth, sure, including some intensely sorrowful-sounding passages, but nothing that undermines the embracing tones and enjoyment of the prolonged moment.", "genre": ["Ambient"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/pariah-here-from-where-we-are-review"}

On  , James Ketchum and Leon Hu capture what the tropics could sound like in the modern age, where an increasingly varied cluster of influences combine to create truly fascinating music. The reference points are all over the place—video games, lo-fi beat masters, hip-hop, salsa greats, Brazilian Tropicália, psych rock—and all of them are blended and transformed into bewildering little worlds that contain multitudes. The album plays out like a fever dream soundtracked by warped guitar loops, steel drums, lush, velvety synths, and twinkling ‘70s Tropicália piano. In fact, the music of Brazil figures heavily across  . Afro-Brazilian percussion provides the foundation for songs like “Ogre Heights” and the funkified “Air Walk,” and what sounds like a pitched-up   drum surfaces in tracks like “Ogre World” and “Dreams.” There’s also a shout-out to the cadences and production style of dub, with sounds materializing and disappearing at the drop of a hat. This collage work comes together beautifully and blissfully in album standout “Midnight Carousel,” in which Mondo Lava juxtapose Casio melodies with Afro percussion and cowbell solos, toned-down space echo breaks, jazz melodies, and what sounds like a looped sample of bird-of- paradise.  is an ambitious effort that succeeds in creating a truly immersive world for its listeners—one that manages to throw the notion of “tropical” on its head, and that is calming and insane in equal measures.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mondo-lava-ogre-heights-review"}

Her latest album,  , has the poignancy of a lullaby, right down to Fresh’s softly-murmured vocals. But just because its pace may be unhurried doesn’t mean its reach isn’t vast. Fresh’s piano playing ranges from sparse and tentative, as on lead single “Deep in the Big,” to rippling and expansive, as on “Boxing Day.” Other tracks introduce sleepy organ, while the closing “Jonah’s Dream” shelves keyboard instruments altogether to hang on folky acoustic guitar. A few guests from Fresh’s hometown of Perth show up along the way, including Pond frontman Nicholas Allbrook, who contributes guitar and vocals. The lyrics aren’t always clear, but Fresh takes a devastating, sigh-like approach to every track that pulls the heartstrings, even when the meaning is left vague. The wistful “Interstate,” which recalls the aching, piano-centered tracks of Cat Power’s  , sets Fresh’s voice at a wavering remove without sacrificing emotional resonance. “Zigrid” brings her voice much closer, layering it over rustling percussion and playful effects, while the nearly nine-minute “11, 12, 13” similarly gives the impression of her being right next to us, whispering like a trusted confidant. Such painstaking intimacy is what sets Rabbit Island apart in the realm of low-key indie pop. Fresh recorded the album back in 2015, but she has spent the intervening years perfecting its artwork, sequencing, and other small details. That revelation only adds to the unmistakable feeling that   is something precious and handmade, glimmering with little secrets.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/rabbit-island-deep-into-the-big-review"}

Album opener “Geyser” delivers what Mitski does best, pitting layers of organ and flourishes of screeching guitar against her urgent voice. With its groovy ballroom bigness, glammed-up single “Nobody” feels like a nod to the disco ballads that soundtracked late ‘60s films set in Los Angeles or London, decorated with bells and xylophones and opening with a hi-hat rhythm that recalls Stevie Nicks’s “Edge of Seventeen.” The lyrics speak of trying to get through a difficult time: “I don’t want your pity / I just want somebody near me / Guess I’m a coward / I just want to feel alright.” Mitski has always had a flair for drama—on   it was the frantic fighting-for-her-life guitar playing of “My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars”; on   it’s understated choruses and plaintive, organ-like keys.   marks a departure from the angsty devastation of first heartbreak evident on previous records.

Both projects explored knowingly schmaltzy production styles and bore the sensibilities of someone who had immersed themselves in the early 2010s attempts to recreate the sound of early 1990s internet. When he shifted to recording under his own name for 2015’s  , he turned these distinctions into assets, cranking them all to widescreen proportions, making swirling, maximalist synth pop that floated between pure honesty and pure exaggeration. Now, three years later,   presents Clanton in a more mature form. Lead singles “Make It Forever” and “Dumb” both maintain the grandness of his previous work; Clanton encases his vocals in echo while layering simple, heavy drum beats and explosive, soaring synth lines to trigger as many sonic climaxes as he can fit. But all that bombast can’t cover the undeniable sense of longing and yearning that permeates the album. “I guess we won’t stop drinking / ‘Cause you’re in the wrong place and I’m in the wrong town,” Clanton murmurs on “Monster,” one of a handful of tracks where he willingly tones down his trademark grandiosity for a moment to express something tender and painful. These moments of vulnerability show that  ’s—and Clanton’s—true greatness lies not in the ability to overwhelm, but his inherent knack and understanding of a pop hook has the ability to elicit catharsis.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/george-clanton-slide-review"}

An untrained musician who picked up the folk harp at 18 and taught herself to play, Rubin has spent the past few years crafting a musical oeuvre that plays like an act of spontaneous creation. In the past, her skeletally simple songs have sounded as though they were being conjured up in the moment of listening, as much   as art created for a wider audience. Sonically, Rubin’s music falls somewhere within the nexus of sound collage, nebulous soundscapes, and the slightest, most intimately personal of folk songs.  , Rubin’s third release and first recorded in a studio, arranges these elements into a sonic time loop of hypnotic harp lines that cascade over booming, march-like beats and only the sparest of ornamentation around her rich, affected vocals, colored by the occasional field recording snippet. The songs tumble gently into each other, creating an atmosphere both calming and slightly eerie, as Rubin’s internal monologue unspools. Producer Phil Hartunian—who also contributed bass, drums, and guitar to the record—gives Rubin’s sound a newfound spaciousness that gives her music a sense of elegance while preserving the unforced purity of her earlier releases. Yet for all its palatial grandeur, there’s something steely about the record. Beneath Rubin’s untrained approach and unfiltered nursery rhyme lyrics is a tough-as-nails creative ambition that demands to be recognized. Continuing the conversation she began on 2016’s  , on I , Rubin deals directly with the struggles of pursuing an artistic life. She bounces from joyful highs (“Out of the Woods”) to gloomy lows (“Why Am I Not Getting Any Better?”) as she ruminates on wanting “to be somebody” without losing herself in the process. Rubin doesn’t go in for metaphor; her lyrics are refreshingly forthright, whether she is wallowing in self pity (“Your life is not as hard as the life you think you’ve led,” she chides herself) or drawing from a deep well of artistic self-respect (“One day they will pay me / One day they will”). On “Peaks and Valleys,” her layered vocals come together in a garbled proclamation that brims with quiet dignity, encapsulating the journey Rubin is undertaking with her art: “I can accept the consequence of doing what I do / I can respect the magic of a life that’s always new.”", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/risa-rubin-im-reliving-the-end-over-and-over-and-over-again-and-its-only-the-beginning-review"}

What began as a concept record about a pair of crooks developed to become a masterful study on greed and the evils of modern living. The album adheres to the philosophical notion, attributed to Mark Twain, that history “doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes,” and some of its most striking observations hint that our current societal ills aren’t exactly new ones. Much of the album’s success can be traced to Babinski’s decision to pair her bleak lyrics with sumptuous and imaginative music: the back-lounge keys in opening track “Flying Colors” blur as if seen through a rainy window; the dynamic string arrangements in lead single “Mothers” bring to mind Radiohead’s lurching (and rejected) theme song for the James Bond film   and “Love and Pressure” employs a similar brand of the low-key funk made popular by Canadian crooner Rhye. Throughout  , Babinski uses her weightless voice as a foil, drawing sweet melodies in the air as if with a fine-tipped pen, even as she prepares to “sharpen my blade” against an enemy and watches warily as soldiers glare from behind a barricade. It’s not until the album’s skeletal closing track, “Desperate Times,” that she plays her hand: the only path forward is through empathy with one’s adversaries. “I would spy, I would preach / I would lie through my teeth,” she coos, ceding that when the going gets rough, people will do nearly anything to save their own skin. “Humankind is in a desperate time,” she states later; it’s a common refrain in 2018, but buried in the surreal world of  , it enables us to consider our shared challenges with fresh eyes.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/steady-holiday-nobodys-watching-review"}

Their latest album,  , takes this concept to immersive new depths—literally. Released as a collaboration with aquatic videography duo   to commemorate the   initiative, the album was conceived as an audiovisual exploration of some of the vibrant coral ecosystems blossoming beneath our oceans. Like the gorgeous footage that this music soundtracks,   is a surreal, slow-motion cycle of lush environments awash in neon tones, oozing with a love for the environment that lays the foundation for Animal Collective to create their own private aquarium of drifting sounds. Panda Bear is notably absent from the proceedings here (a first for the group), making room for Avey Tare, Geologist, and Deakin to largely dispense with song structures, and instead luxuriate in their amorphous, liquid textures. “Buxom” floats along with sparse, bubbling arpeggios, while “Hip Sponge” is punctuated by Avey Tare’s primal yelps, and the lovely “Jake And Me” revolves around soothing drones buoyed by a gentle, pirouetting bassline. There’s a calm sense of wonder at the heart of it all, as well as an alarming unease at the possibility of losing these underwater communities to the ever-increasing epidemic of climate change and global pollution. As both a call for environmental policy reform and a love letter to the untamed beauty of the natural world, Animal Collective have proven once again that kaleidoscopic experiences are everywhere; one only needs to step outside.", "genre": ["Alternative"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/animal-collective-tangerine-reef-review"}

Jansport releases at least one album per year, each one a hybrid of classic boom-bap and soul. A quick follow-up to winter 2017’s  , his ninth beat tape   comfortably bridges the gap between ‘90s rap and oldies that record crate-diggers consider sacred.  is a concept album, on which the producer explores sleep as a way to take refuge from the modern world. Accordingly, the beats are fairly serene, looped into a hypnotic procession of repurposed tracks both familiar and obscure; over the course of 21 tracks (only a few of which exceed the two-minute mark), Jansport reimagines the work of black musical pioneers, mixing pieces of their original work into his own. On “Smokewitchu,” for instance, Jansport quickens the tempo of a rather obvious Rick James classic, cutting up tiny snippets of the funk legend’s voice. “Nu” restructures a beloved Al Green tune by simply looping a sample of it, sporadically filtering out vocals to a lower volume. “G-Wiz” celebrates a number of influences, taking a dark bassline you’d hear during Dr. Dre’s seminal G-funk period and turning up the volume on less polished drums. Elsewhere, the smoothed-out “All” brings an extra knock to 1980s R&B. On this and other songs, Jansport skillfully manipulates the sound of yesteryear, using distortion and modulation to craft an opus all his own. In doing so, he further cements his own legacy while paying homage to like-minded creators before him.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "Instrumental Hip-Hop"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/album-of-the-day-jansport-j-low"}

While label founder Sleep D and regulars such as Dan White (who now records as Rings Around Saturn) work best in energy-raising techno, Sexton’s strength has been in catching you on the comedown. His spacious, downtempo productions and melodic bass playing have made him an essential part of the label through  , collaborations, and  . Now, he takes center stage on his debut album  , a collection of softly-enveloping synth jams as gentle as they are euphoric.  is actually the first full-length release on Butter Sessions, which has stuck strictly to singles and EPs over its eight years. That’s not abnormal for a dance label (LPs aren’t traditionally the genre’s focus), but the choice feels just right for Sexton. Tracks like opener “The Sump” and album highlight “Intercom” take full advantage of that sense of space, floating evocative melodies over watery atmospheres. It makes the basslines and synths feel just as impactful as the silences they dissolve into and emerge out from. Sexton balances  ’s woozy vibe with carefully placed highs. “KSS” threads a playful synth melody through tightly wound drum machine rhythms, while the rippling psychedelia of “Look Back And Lurch” is fueled by a punchy bassline. The best moments though come when Sexton slows down. The gorgeous single “Speak Into It” creates a vast foundation for Sexton’s evocative guitar leads, and it’s followed by the six-minute “Crowbar” where ghostly synths strobe in slow motion. Sexton lets everything burn straight down to its embers on the vast, beatless closer “LS2,” giving   a strong sense of scope (while inviting plenty of replays).

{"img": "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0028767649_2.jpg", "album": "New Hymn to Freedom", "artist": "Szun Waves", "description": "It’s not difficult for a musician to become entrenched in doing their own thing. They spend years developing a personal style and voice so that one day, they can deliver the perfect representation of all of the sounds spinning around in their head, heart, and soul. And therein lies the risk in collaborations between established musicians: after spending so much time engrossed in their own individual projects, a certain creative intractability sets in. But this isn’t a bad thing; one of the highlights of a successful collaboration can be the collisions of perspective. An ideal outcome is when the artists involved can transcend individualism and create something greater than the sum of its parts. For psych-jazz trio Szun Waves, on their sophomore album  , everything falls right into place. With his Portico Quartet, saxophonist Jack Wyllie adapts his fiery delivery so that any heat generated marries with the hypnotic effects of hang drum and percussion. That approach translates seamlessly to Szun Waves. A track like “Temple” illustrates how lightning strikes of saxophone melody are no less essential to a stormy night enchantment as thick clouds of electronic effects and the susurrant murmur of drums. As a member of the jazz-electronica band Triosk, Laurence Pike thrived in an environment where his drums served as the rhythmic driving force behind the harmonic advances of keyboards, electric bass, and samples. This background serves him well on a track like “Constellation,” where his direct approach to tempo helps guide the increasingly volatile outbursts of synthesizers. And speaking of synthesizers, the sleight of hand Luke Abbott utilizes to make a melodic phrase imitate a rhythmic sequence on “Fall Into Rain” is a scheme that allows both Wyllie and Pike to shed their rhythmic responsibilities and just run free. And “running free” is important for this partnership;   is comprised entirely of improvisational material, live and unedited, where the need to express individuality is as important as the communication flowing between the members. Just as the dividing lines between rhythm, harmony, and melody grow fuzzy in the hands of musicians who embrace a multi-tasking approach to collaboration, so too do their individual contributions. Where a cry from saxophone ends and a harmonic wave from synthesizers begins is difficult to pinpoint, as is is the point of contact between the pulsing tempo of synthesizers and the rapid-fire rhythm of drums. For Szun Waves, these lines of demarcation are made irrelevant, because, in the end, it all becomes one.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/szun-waves-new-hymn-to-freedom-review"}

The landscape of heavy rock ‘n’ roll isn’t as competitive as it was in the ‘90s heyday of bands like Monster Magnet, let alone the back-of-the-airbrushed-van hotbox-heady days of the ‘70s. Bands like Kix and Uriah Heep are still putting out quality music, but the kids mainly want to play doom or hardcore inflected-black metal. Electric Citizen could content themselves by recording the aural equivalent of grits and gravy, and those of us occasionally partial to beads and blacklight would probably still thank them for it. So the fact that the band consistently write tightly wound ear candy as vibrant as that written by their long-haired forebears, pushed over the top by frontwoman Laura Dolan’s swooping wail, is a gift. Electric Citizen call their new album   (after the bad-old-days nickname for the neighborhood the band calls home), a “re-alignment” after their slightly more Sabbath-y, sprawled-out album  .  , with its serpentine basslines (by returning original bassist Nick Vogelpohl) and organ stabs/cascades, hark back, in a larger sense, to a beloved and sorely missed sound.

Percussion quickly enters the mix, followed by distant, primal yelps and moans; the whole thing creates a sense of deep uneasiness. It’s a fitting start to Moontribe’s heady, psychedelic record, where African rhythms, meandering electric organs, and tribal chants immerse the listener in what feels like some sort of esoteric outer space ritual. According to the group’s label, the Tel Aviv-based  , the album was submitted on an unmarked two-inch tape—no names, no dates—and one of the songs is “a snake-charming voodoo ritual, in which Moontribe is the Shaman.” All that is known for sure is that the whole album was recorded in a single, unedited session by about a dozen musicians. Perhaps that’s the reason for the record’s sense of spontaneity: melodies fade out and then reappear, distant voices weave their way in and out of the mix, and tracks are suddenly punctuated by skittering organs. But the album feels anything but haphazard; instead, it marches purposefully forward, as if everyone involved is under the same trance. While the album could be filed comfortably next to releases from experimental labels like Canada’s  , Brazil’s  , or Argentina’s  , its swirling melodies seem directly rooted in the sounds of the Middle East and North Africa. When “Bottles” picks up its pace, for example, it feels like a psychedelic take on the mesmerizing percussion grooves of Sudan’s  ; album standout “Osmium” could be a futuristic interpretation of Abdel Gadir Salim’s desert blues.

That almost telepathic connection was no fluke: The band’s debut full-length, 2015’s  , was a taut, cohesive collection of songs, full of jazz-influenced passages roiled by howling post-punk riffs and no wave calisthenics. Pill’s second studio album,  , has direct ties to these early days: “A.I.Y.M?,” which originally appeared on the B-side of the group’s debut single, “Hot Glue,” opens the album—a proper placement for the song’s racing saxophone and bulldozing guitars. But as  progresses, Pill reshape their sound with small tucks rather than wholesale alternations. These changes mostly take the form of more focused arrangements and melodies, which create bristling urgency across a wide range of styles: charred post-punk (the Pylon-esque “Double Think,” the tar-boiled title track), gritty garage-punk (the squelching “Softer Side”), and simmering jazz (the frayed panic of “Sin Compromiso”). Vocalist/bassist Veronica Torres also exhibits more confidence as a singer, especially in the way she contorts her voice to amplify  ‘s pointed politicized statements. On “Fruit,” she deliberately stutters the word “to,” mimicking an insistent snare drum; on “HAHA,” she slurs the first syllable of the word “haunted,” conveying both fear and defiance. Yet her ability to dole out controlled fury is awe-inspiring on highlight “Power Abuser.” Throughout the song, she asks important direct questions (“What am I allowed to create or destroy?”), declares unwavering personal conditions (“I just want a fair trade without exploitation”), and repeats withering social observations (“Sex sells / Money talks”).   has no illusions about easy solutions to ease oppression or frustration.

Her blending of bohemianism, hip-hop swagger, British bass culture, and a joyous feminism were always expressed in her personality, her voice, her fashion sense as much as in her lyrics. That’s true now more than ever. In the past six years, following a long break, she’s been testing new musical waters.  —made with Kieran “Four Tet” Hebden and her husband Cameron McVey—feels like the culmination of those recent experiments. Musically, the album is as rich as any she’s made. Sparkling harps are draped over a shuffling rhythm on “Fallen Leaves”; ghostly chimes provide the sparkling rhythm for “Black Monday,” while “Natural Skin Deep” and “Kong” are propulsive and restless, the former dropping dizzying steel drum samples over hefty beats, the latter riding a fathoms-deep dub groove. As always, the textures and rhythms perfectly frame the songwriting. Lyrically, the album plays out like a set of meditations: impressionistic responses to the “broken politics” of a post-Trump world. It is the very “Neneh Cherry-ness” of it that brings it all into focus, and it makes it a powerful and sustaining statement.

More recently, he’s been flushing out his archives: using the Pre- label, he’s spent the last couple of years putting out hundreds of tracks in various guises. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of them are good. He’s nearing the end of this phase now, with the promise of new music to come, but he’s by no means scraping the barrel. The tracks on  , recorded between 2002 and 2010, are edited together from long, live synthesizer jams—and they sound like it. Whether it’s the Drexiya-like electro of “Beamrider,” the kinky-sounding ‘80s funk of “Machine Worshippers,” or the shiveringly beautiful ambient track “Off World,” these tracks all use minute shifts in timbre and texture to create the greatest effect. There is so much detail here, fidelity obsessives and headphone voyagers will have a ball.

Lewis—remain as potently freethinking as ever. That aesthetic is manifested not only in their band name (their namesake is the 19th-century abolitionist and political activist who helped free hundreds of slaves), but in their freeform, shape-shifting pyrotechnics that ecstatically hurtle from spazzed-out salvos to meditative beauty. Tubman’s hard-grooving sound-world spans free jazz, metal, rock, blues, funk, and dub—and it’s no wonder: veterans Ross, Gibbs, and Lewis’s far-reaching credits include collaborative and supporting stints with Cassandra Wilson, Rollins Band, Henry Threadgill, Sonny Sharrock, and Vanessa Williams, to name a few. Hot on the heels of 2017’s  , a spaced-out, psych-jazz maelstrom on which visionary composer and trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith joined the fray, Tubman—with unofficial fourth member Scotty Hard back in the producer’s chair—hit on all ear-searing cylinders on its fifth—and arguably best—full-length. The album’s title,  , was borrowed from legendary “out”-jazz guitarist Sharrock’s quest “to find a way for the terror and the beauty to live in one song.” Throughout the album, Tubman do just that, melding the brutal with the beautiful. Rumbling with sheets of deafeningly loud feedback and bathed in electronic shimmers and streaks—due in part to the wizardly recording and mixing talents of Hard—the 10 songs that make up   melt into one another with breakneck momentum.

It’s an intriguing title for this posthumous release, which comes just over a year after he passed away from stomach cancer at the age of 68: it reflects not only the remarkable final decade of his life—in which he rose from impersonating a star to becoming one—but his effortless gift for exuberant, emotive performances that was with him long before the world started listening.  Bradley recorded the songs on   over the course of this past decade, during the sessions for his three studio albums (2011’s  , 2013’s     and 2016’s  ); it’s a testament to both his his impassioned vocals and the skill of his deft backing band—the Menahan Street Band—that the tracks retain the feel of a cohesive album. While the riveting “I Feel a Change,” “Can’t Fight the Feeling,” and the slow-burning “Luv Jones” dish up quintessential blasts of Bradley soul, his covers provide proof of his willingness to embrace atypical styles ranging from Americana and grunge to metal and hard rock. (In other words, his devastating take on Black Sabbath’s “Changes,” off Bradley’s 2016’s album of the same name, was no mere novelty.) Here, in  , Bradley and his band reimagine Nirvana’s blistering ode to self-loathing “Stay Away” as a slice of slinky glam. Later, the group deliver a muscled and energetic take on Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold,” emphasizing its narrator’s lonesome yearning. The album’s biggest surprise is its title track, on which Bradley himself does not sing—yet his spirit can be clearly felt within the band’s rolling surges of horns and guitars, radiant and solemn in equal measure. It’s the same mixture of emotions that Bradley channeled masterfully throughout his career. It’s how we knew he heard us, and it’s why we saw ourselves reflected in his pain and his joy.

Some of that is due to the album’s post-genre aesthetic: the songs on   blur the lines between hip-hop, R&B, indie rock, and folk blues, giving the whole project a cohesive but unpredictable sense of atmosphere. “1:04 PM,” produced by Steve Lacy of The Internet, rides a guitar riff that sounds like Terry Callier filtered through ’90s Matador, and spread across an  drum break. But that’s just one example of the omnivorousness of a record that sounds as much like a singer/songwriter effort as it does a Southern rap record. There’s also the Brainfeeder-on-the-Mississippi soul jazz of Lacy/Romil co-production “Bluegrass” and the Teo Halm-produced downtempo groove on “Momma.” When Quadry raps about “bumpin’ Boosie old shit/switch it up to Pink Floyd” over the loping beats and lightheaded synths on “Nowhere to Be Found,” it’s practically a meta-comment on the record itself. But influences don’t mean much without experiences, and Quadry relates his from a perspective that finds realness and strength in vulnerability. “Wesley (For My Son)” successfully executes a difficult concept: Quadry narrates a letter to himself from the point of view of his semi-estranged father, who died in 2016 (“It won’t wait, so chase while you can, son/Only regret, I’ll never see my grandson”). He follows that song with “Momma,” where he empathizes with his mother’s concerns about his future, in a voice that oscillates between guilt and pride. It’s the culmination of an album where lyrics about restless travel (“Motion/Settle”), getting high (“Louis”), and buying new sneakers (“Cross (New Shoes)”) are bursting with self-reflection, personality, and intricate detail.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/quadry-malik-ruff-review"}

Since the genre’s big boom in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s, anthologies of “library music”—stock music for use in movies and TV that could be licensed for cheap—have followed a similar blueprint: open with a few bangers, then pad the remaining fifty-something tracks out with kitsch oddities that have a replay value of nil.

Instead of scouring the production vaults for oddball curious, Anthology have taken a different tack: they’ve made a record people might actually want to listen to.

In fact, if there’s a throughline to  , it’s that all of its songs drift loosely in the orbit of funk and soul. “La Dimostrazione” takes an acid-bitten approach, weaving a gnarled guitar line behind a booming bass groove; Electric Machine’s “Fancy Good” pilots wah-wah disco guitars between slow-boiling percussion, and even the ballad “Tropicola,” which is awash in luxurious strings, finds room for a restless bassline (it also employs a  —for parity with the title, one would guess). As that song proves,   is just as effective when the tempo dips; “Half Forgotten Daydreams” by John Cameron is a gentle, fluttering soul number that lands somewhere between Minnie Riperton and The Free Design; and “You’ve Got What It Takes,” credited to Les Hurdle, Kathleen Poppy, and Madeline Bell, is a quiet-storm soul number with an easy-gliding vocal melody. The whole thing works together so well that it could easily pass for a “‘70s Soul Rarities” comp, rather than a collection of songs by anonymous musicians, designed for rental by low-budget film producers.

Born in the village of Gotha in 1929, Kuban imported Nubian folk traditions into Cairo’s urban environs.

Other highlights include “Hanwil Tanza”‘s sublime serpentine melody and the brassy snap of “Amira.” Sadly, Egypt’s repressive treatment of the Nubian ethnic minority has done no favors for Kuban’s musical legacy.

I believe this is why I could empathize with my friends so deeply. Their stories helped me to heal. Death and grief are a part of life.

The songs on   are perfectly crafted to suit those dual aims. There’s a kind of ghostliness about them—the way the guitars and keys and electronics feel wreathed in fog, the way Trappes’ voice drifts through them, like Elizabeth Fraser or Lisa Gerrard navigating a This Mortal Coil song. Songs like the haunting “Burn On” with its quietly pleading vocal line and big, distant, pealing pianos, seem to occupy the space where pain gives way to quiet acceptance. On “Maeve,” Trappes punctures extended held silences with big gongs of treated piano, so grand and fragile and majestic they feel like castles made of glass.

It’s a beautiful vision that he, along with accomplices Mariano and percussionist Nappy G, turned into one of the city’s most celebrated outdoor dance parties, Turntables on the Hudson. The club night, which debuted in 1998, quickly became known for its daring, eclectic, no-holds-barred aesthetic; in a single set, you could hear an obscure Puerto Rican salsa track, Spanish flamenco, a brassy Balkan beat jam, a batucada-inflected MPB track, and a sultry, New York house classic. Over the years, the party expanded, holding events in Barcelona, Ipanema, the Caribbean, and the Nile, and absorbing the sounds of those regions and pulling them into the Turntables universe. In that sense,  is not just a historical document, but a celebratory set in its own right, capturing the party’s ethos and heralding its launch into the future. The massive, 20-track compilation transports listeners to the middle of the dancefloor, with Nickodemus acting as tour guide through the sounds that defined the party’s vibe. The record opens with feel-good, reggae-funk and brass classics like “Roady” from the New Zealand band Fat Freddy’s Drop, and “Good Life” from the band Brassroots. Both songs blend seamlessly into one another, a nod to the mixture of funk, jazz, hip-hop, and house that are mainstays of Nickodemus’s live sets. From there, the compilation moves into the tropical decadence of Cotonete & Dimitri from Paris’ “Parribean Disco” and Bonobo’s “Cirrus,” seamlessly oscillating from high-energy club thumping to introspective dance jams at the drop of a hat. It also features its fair share of leftfield moments, like Trüby Trio’s flamenco track, “Jaleo,” and Oscar Sulley and the Uhuru Dance Band’s “Bukom Mashie,” a psychedelic Afrobeat banger. Collaborations like Quantic and Nickodemus’ rumba fusion jam “Mi Swing es Tropical” and the rap-funk collaboration “Gimme The Music” with The Real Live Show and Orchestre Poly-Rythmo are a testament of the power of a shared vision. Taken together, the songs on  create a kind of back-and-forth dialogue, a nod to the music that started it all, and a window into a hopeful future.", "genre": ["World", "dance"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-turntables-on-the-hudson-20-year-anniversary-review"}

Their latest album,  their fifth in two years, and one of two new albums this month—was created during a studio session in London. The band built the compositions around sketches and themes, with each musician feeding off the energy musical cues of the other to build self-contained sonic worlds, rich in mystery, sensuality, mischief, and darkness. The songs are driven by a wide percussive palette, drawing on everything from traditional syncopation to Middle Eastern-style drumming. It’s frenetic and subtle in equal measures, and an impressive canvas for the soft wail of the saxophone, the low-but-strong hum of the bass clarinet, and the staccato ripples of both the electric and the upright bass. The group’s strength is generating a wide range of emotions from two extremes: minimalism, and the wild experimentation that incorporates elements of electronic music. On the melancholy album opener “Calling,” the percussion, sax, and bass seem to execute a kind of tentative slow dance. Album standout “Incandescent Rage” begins with a haunting, minor key conversation between saxophone and bass clarinet, but explodes into a jungle-meets-drone composition that could easily soundtrack a car chase in a noir film. All of these elements work together to create an album that demands attention—music swathed in dense atmosphere, and as alive as the most vivid of dreams.", "genre": ["Jazz"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/ill-considered-ill-considered-5-review"}

He’s performed on, engineered, and produced several of the band’s records. As a solo artist, Hirsch brings some of the headier sensibilities of the earliest half of the Hiss Golden Messenger catalog into full bloom. His second standalone effort,  , offers a fresh batch of songs that kick back to classic country, tempered with a satisfying dose of psychedelia.  The album’s anxious opening salvos—wriggling, warped guitar and a sparse drum-machine beat, followed by a warm blast of old-soul horns—offer immediate insights into its unwieldy style. Hirsch develops these jittery arrangements as extensions of the album’s overarching themes of love, comfort-seeking, and (as suggested by the title) the passage of time. “Nothing But Time,” for example, finds Hirsch ruminating on the past with familiar remember-when fondness, without becoming too beholden to the good or the bad: “She’s in my head too much now / Not to mention in my dreams / And all these tales we’ve spun / They fell apart at the seams.” The relaxed pace that Hirsch maintains across   is a steadying force; Hirsch seems to approach his troubles with clear-headed thoughtfulness rather than scattered panic. Waves of pedal steel and pools of reverberating guitar lend a complementary sense of fluidity to the entire record, abetted by Hirsch’s cosmic lyricism on the lithe instrumental numbers “A Pair of Nines” and “Pink Moment.” By most accounts, reckoning with all the years we’ve lost, wasted—or even just passed without incident—is like fingering some existential hair-trigger. Hirsch’s record, by contrast, provides a comforting reminder of the inverse argument: it’s simply a matter of time.", "genre": ["Rock", "singer-songwriter", "indie rock"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/scott-hirsch-lost-time-behind-the-moon-review"}

And considering that the Sacramento quartet actually broke up in 2010, any new material at all is something of a bonus. The group’s uncertain lease on life informs the title of their new LP,  , which mirrors the spot-on garage revelry of 2004’s  . These are bash-and-thrash anthems delivered with enough burning urgency to sound genuinely threatening. While there is an obscure cover in The Jagged Edge’s “You Can’t Keep a Good Man Down”—one of two tracks sung with surprising melodic appeal by wild-card drummer Matt K. Shrugg—you don’t need to be a ’60s completist to appreciate this record. Anyone with a passing familiarity of early Kinks, Troggs, and Beatles rave-ups should be right on board from the opening title track, which announces the band’s blurted punch amid bruising drum fills. It’s the longest song here, at just over three-and-a-half minutes, with a chorus that’s among the album’s more restrained moments. From there, Shrugg, lead guitarist Mike Farrell, bassist Stan Tindall, and singer/guitarist Tim Foster ratchet up their tug-of-war between fine-tuned precision and all-out chaos.

Her main focus has always been software development, but her spare few albums (  was her second, coming 11 years after her 1980 debut  ) show an artist pushing the boundaries of electronic music to unexplored spaces.  Due to its overarching focus on texture, Spiegel’s music is generally classified as ambient, but there’s very little about   that could be described as such; the propulsive, perfectly sequenced flow imbues the album with a unique, uncharacteristic linearity (an impressive cohesiveness, considering the songs’ staggered creation process). It opens with the 1989 triptych “Three Sonic Spaces,” one of the purest displays of Spiegel’s revolutionary algorithm-based software Music Mouse, which she developed originally for Amiga, Macintosh, and Atari computers. Here, Spiegel uses her “intelligent instrument” (so named for its built-in knowledge of scales and chords) to program an entire sonic world that feels as organic as it does unsettling. From there,  ’s power builds incessantly, intensely, and inevitably. Progressing from “Two Archetypes: Hurricane’s Eye” to the epic Music Mouse-composed “Sound Zones,” waves of drone and dense layers of synths fill the space completely; even more all-consuming is “Riding The Storm,” a stunner which, at any given moment, can sound as dreamy as   or as harsh as  . We finally arrive on the uncharted territory hinted at in the album’s title on the blissful vignettes “Strand Of Life” and “From A Harmonic Algorithm,” which have delicate melodies and a warmth that feels nothing short of miraculous after the time-bending rush preceding it. The stop is momentary however, as   closes with a 14-minute finale, appropriately titled “Passage,” that almost retraces the album’s entire trajectory in miniature. In the years following   extremely limited CD run, Spiegel’s work has become sparser and harder to find, often focusing on shorter commissioned work tucked away on out-of-print compilations, but her influence has never stopped expanding. As experimental electronic music flowed from noise to New Age in the 2000s with artists like   and  , and ambient has experienced a renaissance in the 2010s,  , a music focused on texture that is absolutely not “as interesting as it is ignorable.” Spiegel’s influence has never felt stronger, thanks to labels like  .’s  ., and the algorithmically-focused virtuosity of artists like  .

Written in the wake of his father’s passing, and as Tweedy enters his 50s, these deeply intimate and skeletal songs consider what it means to remain in the present, what it means to be a link in a family chain, and what it means to appreciate the joys of life even as darkness threatens to swallow us whole. Rarely has Tweedy conveyed so much emotion with such sparse arrangements. On standout track “How Hard It is for a Desert to Die,” each vivid note of his acoustic guitar carries remarkable emotional heft. On opening track “Bombs Above,” he recounts his battle with opioid addiction in a near-whisper—“I’m taking a moment to apologize,” he sings—backed by knotted guitars and his elder son, Spencer, gently thumping the drums. Even “Let’s Go Rain,” a major-key jangle and the album’s most accessible track, utilizes its sunny melody as a foil for an allegory of total destruction, and the deception makes it all the more chilling. On “War on War,” from  , Tweedy proclaimed, with then-typical abstraction, that “You have to learn how to die / If you want to want to be alive.” Throughout  , he conveys his gratitude for that life with a clarity and solemnity that, finally, brings that sentiment into sharp focus. “I don’t believe in heaven,” he sings on the album’s title track.

To wit,  might scan as cryptic when taken at surface level. In the context of Steve White’s 20-year career, however, it speaks volumes. His machine-augmented soulfulness—a paradoxical musical force, warmly organic and yet faintly futuristic—has been there since the days of the Spacek trio’s extraordinary, otherworldly 2001 debut,  , which found him and his compatriots fusing future-facing sounds with deep-spirited emotion. His adopted, cosmically-inspired surname gestures to the sci-fi sensibility that’s coursed through each of his projects, such as  , 2005’s chrome-laden solo debut. marks the end product of over 12 years of development; many of its tracks started as concepts dating back to the  era, which White subsequently and belatedly brought to fruition. White’s music has always followed its own path, though, and his stripped-back approach here ensures the songs don’t sound dated. His caramel-rich, offbeat vocal style sounds more assured than ever. The opening title track sets the template to follow: his voice positioned center stage, just two or three elements to complement it at any time. The two sides to White’s music sit more comfortably together than ever before, boundary-testing sonics balanced with lyrics that are earnestly heart-on-sleeve. There’s a poise to each of its songs, a confidence in their sparse, syncopated swagger. On “Deep Inside,” bass and drums are wonderfully off-kilter, White’s voice complemented by a warm glow of pads. “What would it take,” he softly sings, “for me to get into your soul?” His music has always told universal, time-worn stories in otherworldly tones, and perhaps nowhere so superlatively as here.", "genre": ["Electronic"], "link": "https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/steve-spacek-natural-sci-fi-review"}

(At least, those dinosaur puns seem designed to crack themselves up.) Like the NYC-based band’s sound in general, this punchy record could be loosely, lazily categorized as a post-punk LP, at least until you dig deeper. The group, which consists of vocalist Lyris Faron, guitarist Vera Kahn, bassist Annie Fidoten, and drummer Ebun Nazon-Powe, have previously named in   a varying   of  , ranging from The Bags and Johnny Cash to Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Avril Lavigne. Album highlight “Coffee?” is a direct product of those broad tastes, with the band fluctuating between ’70s punk, funk, ska, and a pop breakdown that easily could’ve come from a lost, decade-old Ke$ha song. Later, on “Baby,” they use sugary harmonies and reverbed-out snare drum to tap into the overwhelming sweetness of a ‘60s girl group, a compelling counterbalance for the shaggy indie-rock riffs. The production is a little on the lo-fi side, conjuring images of a dirty, energetic Brooklyn warehouse practice space that’s littered with paper coffee cups and filled with laughter. There’s a theatricality to T-Rextasy’s lyrical style that feels brassy (and maybe even a little corny) at times, and the music is all the more charming for it: Take “The Zit Song,” where Faron chronicles a particularly bad acne breakout to shape her central message of affirmation: “‘Cause I’m the prom queen, I’m the teen dream, worship me baby, when you see me you’ll scream.” From vintage shopping to zits to high school to dating apps, the subject matters on   often teeter on the line between frivolous and fun-loving.

First, there’s the unique saxophone-and-dual-guitar frontline of Chicago saxophonist Greg Ward’s Rogue Parade quintet, a hard turn from the orchestral Mingus-isms of his most recent album, 2016’s  . Second, and by extension, is the degree to which Ward develops those guitars into powerful extensions of himself. Consider a song like “The Contender.” Meant to musically portray his favorite boxing combinations, Ward’s improvisation is appropriately staccato, sounding like sharp, quick jabs. But once it segues into guitarist Matt Gold’s solo, this all takes on a new timbre, as though the titular boxer had changed trunks and fought on; guitarist Dave Miller’s incessant accents suddenly turn into taunts. On a fragmentary “Stardust,” the stringers’ ability to keep up with Ward’s free-ranging improv proves equally uncanny and heartbreaking. Not that Gold and Miller are mere yes-men. “Let Him Live” finds the saxophonist following their twin leads; on “Black Woods,” they articulate the theme with Ward, only to pull a feint when Miller interjects from the left channel, kickstarting an aggressive back-and-forth which culminates in a contrapuntal tangle, bassist Matt Ulery and drummer Quin Kirchner egging them on all the while. Ward simply incorporates their visions into his own: They are his avatars, but with room to maneuver. That   freely weighs progressive jazz concepts against sounds from Chicago’s avant-rock scene is not entirely unexpected, given their hometown’s reputation for off-kilter musical fusion. Importantly, the band’s interplay gestures beyond that storied starting point; its sound—intricate and yet edgy, melodic but distorted, with stomping rhythms and a confrontational mien—has as much in common with proto-punkers Television as with post-rockers Tortoise.
