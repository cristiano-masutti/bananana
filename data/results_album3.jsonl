He proceeds to unspool a thrilling half-written, half-freestyled two-minute verse, as wild-eyed and manic as anything he’s put to tape. It’s one of the year’s best rap performances—and he doesn’t remember recording it at all. In a harrowing,   with  , Brown recounts a decade-plus descent into the blurry depths of drug use and alcoholism, how the Covid-19 lockdown exacerbated his substance abuse, and the looming feeling that he could only regain control by dying. In March, Brown checked himself into rehab. Now, several months sober with a healthier outlook on life, he’s back with the years-in-the-making  , his most vulnerable album to date. Brown worked on   (which means “40” in Italian) before getting help, and it very much sounds like a man zeroing in on rock bottom. Though the jittery first half feels akin to   or  ’s paranoid, drain-circling vibe, it’s more chest-wheezing than jaw-clenching. In the past, beats could barely contain Danny Brown; he’d hurtle across songs like a car driving off a cliff. Here, his voice still rises to those maniacal peaks, but he restrains himself more, blending into the sonics rather than tearing them apart. You can hear Brown realizing that hard living is taking its toll. The record’s second half has the serotonin-depleted mood of a multi-day hangover. The tempos trudge and Brown’s usually animated voice turns dour, rarely rising above a heavy-lidded mumble. It’s some of his most profoundly sad work. On the aching “Down Wit It,” Brown gingerly steps through Paul White’s atmospheric synths, recounting how his out-of-control behavior dissolved his relationship. “Hanami” finds Brown in the midst of an existential crisis, lamenting how things that usually bring him pleasure—making music, drugs, booze—don’t work anymore. He hasn’t lost all hope, reassuring himself that life is a blessing, but he’s cognizant that a change needs to happen. For all its bloodletting and heartache,   is still a reminder that few can outrap Danny Brown. Despite the depths he plumbs, Brown’s pen remains as sharp as ever, his flows inventive and fresh 20 years into his career. “I still love hip-hop,” Brown asserts in that   interview, and it comes through clearly on songs like the generation-spanning production of “Y.B.P.” or the MIKE-assisted barfest of “Celibate.”   is a milestone in Brown’s career, a fitting end to the past decade’s spiraling self-destruction, a cathartic clearing of space, and an assertion that Danny Brown is still alive, ready to embrace what comes next.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}

{"album": "Integrated Tech Solutions", "artist": "Aesop Rock", "description": "“Integrated Tech Solutions: Building a bridge to a better tomorrow,” announces an AI-sounding voice at the outset of MC and producer  ‘s 10th album. Over a peppy ’80s infomercial–style backing track, the digital voice sketches out a corporate goal focused on persuading an unsuspecting populace to buy into “a system of lifestyle and industry applications designed to curate a desired multi-experience.” Then the voice speeds up so it can babble out a disclaimer that absolves the company of any and all potential liability. Against this backdrop of a fictional capitalist monster corporation, Aesop Rock explores the ways technology—and humankind’s predictable abuse of it—shapes both the world and the individual. “Two point five million years ago/ A friend of mine made a tool from a stone and defended his tribe,” raps the MC over the wormy funk of agenda-setting cut “Mindful Solutionism.” The track, a nod to vintage Run-DMC rhyme patterns, goes on to itemize a sarcastic list of developments that sprung from that first invention, including weaponized atom splitting, automated workforces, and chemistry-facilitated genocide. “Cameras in your favorite corners, plastic in the wilderness,” continues Aesop Rock, reaching the crux of the tirade: “We can not be trusted with the stuff that we come up with/ The machinery could eat us—we just really love our buttons.” Aesop Rock displays a hefty dose of skepticism emanates across the 18-track album, on which the MC’s bars are laid atop a selection of mostly self-produced backdrops that often strike a bluesy note thanks to judicious use of prowling basslines and deliberately downcast guitar. On “Pigeonometry,” the MC describes the way Leonardo Da Vinci’s inventions and theories have been twisted and exploited. Four songs into the album,   graces “Living Curfew” with a guest verse that casts him as a lonesome observer of eerie times: “I remember when nights was ambulance sirens/ Watching ’em put bodies inside ’em/ Sometimes somebody outside whylin’ on empty streets dead silent/ Half-empty stores, scared to breathe,” raps woods, flashing back to the early days of the pandemic over a backdrop of murmuring blues. As the album nears its conclusion, a more hopeful environmental vision emerges. Aesop casts his gaze towards nature as an escape route from the capitalist tech grind on “By The River.” An ode to the nourishing power of bodies of water, Aesop sketches a portrait of the Hudson, Susquehanna, and Willamette rivers that’s shot through with childlike wonder. “I wonder what could possibly be lurking on the bottom,” he raps over gently undulating funk. “I look into the water and imagine all the options.” In the end, it’s the ideal of discovery and imagination that becomes the antidote to the relentless march for profit.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}

He’s a co-owner and operator of   which is a home for the city’s greatest underground weirdos, and his name is often found in producer or instrument credits for artists on that label and beyond. On  his third solo album, Morimoto keeps his eyes on what matters artistically and interrogates everything else. “It didn’t used to be content/ It used to be art,” Morimoto sighs on “Feel Change,” before going on to lament how the music industry encourages social climbing and “deconstructing my identity for opportunities on “Reality.” His clearest attempt at defining the opposition to these spiritual bummers is in “If The Answer Isn’t Love,” on which he asks a higher power what will remain when the world as we know it has crumbled. “If the answer isn’t love/ Then forget that I asked,” is the punchline. The destruction Morimoto imagines nods to the literal threat of world disaster, but also to the way disillusionment can ravage your sense of purpose. While previous Morimoto albums have been defined by chaotic, rambling maximalism,  is far more structured around hooks and grooves, though no less compositionally complex. “If The Answer Isn’t Love” sounds like a Motown track with fuzzed-out guitar solos. “Bad State” is a psychedelic funk cut, a little reminiscent of Toro Y Moi with its big, bold vocal hooks. It’s a kind of songwriting that’s easy to take at face value, which bolsters Morimoto’s words, turning them into transmissions meant to be clearly received. That’s most prominent on the album’s standout, title track “Diagnosis.” This is the one song where Morimoto really lets himself shine as a rapper, hamming up his voice and showing off with his rhymes. He explores life under capitalism’s boot, the feeling of working all day to afford the comforts you need to keep working, too exhausted to envision an alternative. “Capital manipulates the labor/ Make a bag, it feels like it’ll save ya/ The money never acts against its nature/ Fuck the cops, the banks, the legislature,” is his mic-drop moment at the end of the excellent second verse. Often across  it feels like Morimoto takes on the role of a friend offering gentle but urgent advice. “At some point, you’ll have to start living your life instead of thinking about it,” he sings on “Bad State”; “Picking at scabs won’t heal them faster/ In fact, you’ll make a scar out of nothing,” on “What You Say.” That his tone is encouraging, as opposed to despondent, feels deliberate. Morimoto’s diagnosis is that it’s hard to concentrate on great art under a cold and cruel system; love, warmth, and kindness are the antidotes.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "Whiplash", "artist": "Asha Sheshadri", "description": "There’s a concept called  —the opposite of déjà vu—that occurs when the familiar is rendered unfamiliar; it’s the feeling when, for instance, a room you know well suddenly seems strange (has that sofa always been that color?), or if you miss a turn on a route you’ve driven a thousand times, or a family member seems, for one moment, like a complete stranger. On debut album  , New York-based ambient composer and sound artist Asha Sheshadri creates pieces that embody this feeling.  liner notes state that the tracks were “arranged & recorded… in bedrooms, living rooms, libraries, bars, airplanes, backyards and parks across North America,” but although this might suggest familiarity or even domesticity, the sonic flotsam and jetsam (including white noise, overlapping conversations, rustling, nondescript electronic beeping) is paired with enigmatic spoken word parts, both becoming headier and stranger by their proximity to one another. If you’ve ever been moved by a strange exhibition in an art gallery, but you’re quite not sure why, then this album is for you. Listening to   we never quite get an answer. Sheshadri seems to delight in creating pieces that are somehow just out of reach. Is that the sound of a church bell tolling beneath layers of electronic processing on “I Know, You’re Cold”? What are those chewed-up textures on “Stimulus Progression” that seem forever crumpling in on themselves? The spoken word samples on “Irreplaceable” are cut off by blasts of mechanical whirring before they can get to any real meaning: “my current art practice relies primarily on the plundering and interpretation of th— in order to represent—.” In the liner notes, Sheshadri also explains that   evokes “a refracted ambivalence towards what was once real, the endless cycle of reckoning with wherever ‘home’ has taken place.” The church bells on “I Know You’re Cold” were “once real” but are now saturated with a heavy flanging effect and overlaid with the sound of running water, foregrounding a free-flowing narrative. The piano—an instrument often associated with domestic, homey spaces—on “Whiplash,” “Shipwreck,” “Stimulus Progression,” and “Looting Index” is distressed and detuned until it sounds ghostly and fragile. The specificity of the lyrics—“flying over middle America on a plane seat without a retractable tray” on “A Holding Pattern,” or “the North Country Fair Mall at the particular time of day when it feels like a ghost mall inside and it’s sweltering outside” on album highlight “Some Places to Find Quiet and Peace”—suggests how transitory the temporary homes of “bedrooms, living rooms, libraries” or plane seats, for all their immediate realness, really are. It’s notable that the vocal samples, sourced from “video work, excerpts from writers…recovered and recycled voice/text memos,” used by Sheshadri often seem to be from supporting characters in a story rather than main ones (“Supporting Characters” is even a song title on  ): someone reminds a friend of their personal growth, a woman memorializes her mother, a documentary-style voiceover explains part of a musician’s oeuvre. Many are reminiscent of short stories by Breece D’J Pancake or Miranda July, where one vital piece of information seems to hover, specter-like, over the narrative but is never explicitly mentioned. It’s in these spaces between meaning, though, that this strange and lovely album calls home. Would you prefer it explained?", "genre": ["Experimental", "sound art"]}
{"album": "Access To The Lonely", "artist": "Rid of Me", "description": ", the 2021 debut from Philadelphia-based, DIY, noisy rock outfit  , signaled a fledgling band on the cusp of finding its sound. Reverb-drenched and murky, it hurdled from British post-punk melodicism to big grungy licks complete with a poppy sensibility, in large part due to the aching confessionals and face-melting cries let loose by bassist and vocalist Itarya Rosenberg. While   conjured bleary-eyed images of a plastered late-night at some dark and dingy DIY basement, Rid Of Me’s sophomore effort, , is huge, even arena-sized. Judging from the band’s scorched-earth precision, it’s clear that Rosenberg, guitarists Mike McGinnis and Jon DeHart; and drummer Mike Howard were schooled on a healthy dose of ’90s grunge, post-hardcore, and noise-rock — and Rid Of Me have that combo of rage, noise, and melody down pat. Rosenberg’s propulsive bottom end is particularly gnarly; in tandem with Howard’s driving, odd time signature-laden pummeling, the rigorous one-two punch hints at the Jesus Lizard’s beast of a rhythm section. Factor in McGinnis and Hart’s cutthroat twin guitar salvos, and there’s nary a moment to exhale throughout the album’s eleven meaty tracks. Like the smattering of covers sprinkled on their Bandcamp page, which include serviceable takes on  ,  , and   classics, Rid Of Me don’t shy away from showing off their influences on  . “Feel Me” sounds like an outtake from  ; “Libertarian Noise Rock” is two blistering minutes of Helmet-like fury; “Cut” approaches a sludgy heaviness that hits as hard as the  . Aside from unleashing catchy ear bleeders with abandon, Rid Of Me are just as adept when turning down the volume and Rosenberg is to thank for that. He runs the emotional gamut, screaming his head off on one song (“Hell of It”), then achieving a quiet beauty and crushing hearts the next (“The Weekend”). Personal struggles inform Rosenberg’s lyrics and titles like “I’m So Lonesome I Could Die,” “Gutted,” and namesake song “Rid Of Me” are manifestations of those internal battles. But even when struggling with demons, there’s a flickering glimmer of hope as   fairly bursts with a new lease on life-type energy. That’s reflected in the pulverizing riffage and bottomless hooks the quartet bang out, and with Rosenberg’s brutally honest nature exposed, Rid Of Me hit on all cylinders.", "genre": ["Rock"]}
{"album": "The Comeback Kid", "artist": "Marnie Stern", "description": "About a year after  ’s last solo record (2013’s  ), the guitar heroine got tapped for a gig no one could have predicted: a high-profile cleanup hitter spot in Seth Meyers’ house band. In retrospect, her eight-year stint in the 8G Band makes perfect sense given the post-hardcore/punk-rock pedigree of her bandmates, which included Syd Butler and Seth Jabour ( ); Eli Janney ( ); and time keeper-turned-actor Fred Armisen (Trenchmouth). But let’s be honest: Stern’s dizzying music is in a manic league of its own, so much so that her late night TV licks never quite reflected her range as a restless singer-songwriter and straight-up  . Enter   the long overdue return of the New York native’s first love: leaping into the void like her life depends on it. Or at the very least, her existential sense of self and overall happiness—something she appears to directly address on the tightly wound opening track “Plain Speak.” As Stern’s riffs careen across the splashy percussion of Arcade Fire drummer Jeremy Gara—a fitting replacement for past foils like Zach Hill ( ) and Kid Millions ( )—she repeats a mantra we can all relate to: “I can’t keep on moving backwards.” Considering how confident and slick   is, the line serves as both a fitting mission statement and palpable modus operandi. At 12 songs and 29 minutes, Stern’s fifth album is arguably her most focused, leaving very little room either to breathe or fully absorb the sounds flying by our ears and eyes. That goes for everything from the hypnotic vocal hooks and wildly expressive call-and-response chords of “Earth Eater” to the prickly, borderline power ballad progressions of “Til It’s Over.” Stern even puts her own personal stamp on   with an infectious rendition of the chorus line composition “Il Girotondo Della Note” that sounds as if it were beamed from a bouncy castle on Mars. Which kinda explains the album’s comic book-ish cover;  isn’t just a reminder of Stern’s roots and the revved-up records she’s yet to write. It’s a feral whirlwind of fearless riffs and ideas that holds absolutely nothing back in its pursuit of personal  growth.

This year alone, he’s already put        , with another due  . On his latest “solo” work,  , Shiroishi works in tandem not with another human performer, but with the space offered by monumental architecture. And while musicians have long used the cavernous acoustics of cathedrals and churches to impart a certain grandiosity, here Shiroishi performs in a shrine to L.A.’s cult of the personal vehicle: a parking structure. Recorded in a single take, the record explores sonic negative space, staking out improvised interactions between silence, performance, and resonance. Stepping onto the well-trodden territory of Japanese philosophy, Shiroishi refers to the concept of 間 (“ma,” or negative space) when discussing the album in the liner notes. On opener “stand still like a hummingbird,” the spaces in between the notes leave room for a thickly reverberant atmosphere which his sparse, staccato saxophone intimations disrupt, the tones settling like dust. Other tracks are packed with rapid, virtuosic runs (“i almost said”) or smooth, melodic figures (“if only heaven would give me another ten years”). Shiroishi explores how different saxophone timbres (and even crisp glockenspiel in “how will we get back to life again?”) interact with the concrete walls around him, shifting from smooth to strained to whispered tones. The effect is at once minimalist and abstract, requiring an attentive ear to indulge in its capacious sound. This abstract music isn’t being made in a vacuum, however, as “tule lake blues” suggests. Taking its name from Tule Lake—the site of the largest Japanese American internment camp during World War II—the song isn’t the   Shiroishi’s invoked the history of his ancestors. But in the context of an exploration of space—particularly negative, or so-called “empty” space—the solemn tones of “tule lake blues” not only call to mind the vacated homes of Japanese American internees but also the “empty” land onto which they were relocated. No land in America, after all, is truly empty, and Tule Lake was the largest example of how land dispossessed from Indigenous Americans was   for wartime incarceration. So in the plaintive wails that Shiroishi extracts from his sax—at times evoking a violin, at others a piercing shriek—we might hear the politics of space and its emptying; the history of two removals, one predicated on the other.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "Magg Tekki", "artist": "Assiko Golden Band de Grand Yoff", "description": "Sitting at the westernmost tip of Africa, Dakar has long been the stage on which the Black Atlantic’s extensive networks of trade and exploitation have played out. For centuries merchants from Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Guinea, and the Ivory Coast have passed through the city, bringing with them their distinctive traditions, rhythms, and instruments. Between the 15th and 19th centuries, nearby Gorèe Island became the largest slave-trading center on the African coast, and millions of Bantou,  Bambara, Malinke,  and Yoruba people were held there before being shipped off to the Americas. Their ancient rhythms still echo across Gorée, and continue to shape Dakar’s music to this day. This is the kind of kaleidoscopic musical syncretism that  draw on when building their buoyant, hypnotic songs. For 20 years, the large drum collective has been entertaining crowds at celebrations, rallies, and underground parties, and their music is rooted in the multitude of cultures that co-exist in Grand Yoff, the sprawling working-class Dakar neighborhood where they are based. But their music is more than mere entertainment: the ensemble started out as a mutual aid group, and their songs carry messages about the importance of community and cooperation inspired by the Sufi teachings of the Mouride Brotherhood. The band matches the propulsive energy of the drums with inspiring and encouraging lyrics: “Assiko Band music from the heart/ It’s pure joy” they chant over a barrage of percussion and bright horns on “La Musique Du Cœur.” That rousing track opens  , which, despite their ubiquitous presence in Dakar’s nightlife, is Assiko Band’s first album. The record is a collaboration between the ensemble and Swedish musician  who in 2018 traveled to Senegal and founded   after connecting with local musicians.

Assiko Golden Band’s deluge of polyrhythms and chant-like vocals have a transcendental quality, as if wanting to transport their audience to a higher ground. Take the soaring “Xaritt,” for example, which starts off with a single, meditative voice before quickly picking up speed and taking off, carried by a swell of   drumming and harmonized vocals proudly proclaiming: “We build our own country.” Despite the songs  being recorded in Senegal but partially assembled in Sweden,   retains all of the music’s spontaneity and live energy.  The whole album has a strong sense of place, inviting you to basque in the raucous atmospheres of a celebration on the streets of Dakar. Even during the two   interludes, the album’s only quiet moments, subtle field recordings transport you to the city’s edge, looking out onto the Atlantic ocean.", "genre": ["World"]}

Opener “Rainbow Metal Chime in the Sun” lives up to its bright title, centered on blunt, xylophone-esque tones which eventually give way to  s and arpeggiations. “Muzzy Doppler Chime” is bouncy and faintly clubby, contrasting church bell-like timbres with a featherweight downtempo groove.

Luckily, the millions of Latinos living in the United States know better. This art warrants praise and demands acknowledgment for what it is—an intrinsic part of the beautiful, diverse fabric of this country. On  , Cash Bently, an American-born producer with El Salvadorian and Guatemalan roots, shows that a memorable album doesn’t appear out of thin air. Bently started his music career at age seven, touring as part of his family’s cumbia band, and later became part of a new wave of artists and producers on Soundcloud, where he immersed himself in a subgenre of trap called pluggnB. Combining his upbringing in a primarily Latin American community with his experience as a Soundcloud rapper, Cash Bently delivers a modern take on regional Mexican music, somewhere between hip-hop,  , and  . These influences are immediately recognizable in tracks like “Platicar” and “Enamorado” on  “Platicar” is a mellow ballad with softly Auto-Tuned vocals, high-pitched echoes, and racy lyrics that imply an affair with a married woman. Boasting traditional horns and string flourishes, “Enamorado” brings out a bravado in Bently with which he effortlessly serenades an imaginary lover, as if he were an elder crooner. Standout “Negaron Un Favor” recounts Bently’s experience growing up in the States. Its tough lyrics speak about sipping codeine and out-earning his peers, all while trying to carve a name for himself. The horn arrangements, tightly paired with a polished acoustic guitar riff, make for a hard-hitting tune that is part corrido, part outlaw country. Songs like “Amar Otra Vez” and “Este Mundo,” showcase Bently’s versatility. Understated bedroom pop arrangements marked by subtle electronic textures and warbly synth tones act as a bridge to a mellower section of the album. These tracks dispense with horns and punchy strings in favor of an indie pop approach. On both songs, Bently channels feelings of alienation and longing: being at odds with the world, experiencing heartbreak, and yearning for a loved one. And though these themes are present throughout the album, they never become redundant. Instead, they work together as one long multifaceted ballad that reflects dual musical lineages. Cash Bently’s infusion of modern hip-hop with Mexican traditional music creates a uniquely American album influenced by the precedents of Black and Latin innovators—captivating and sonically rich.", "genre": ["Latin"]}
{"album": "Buy This Now!", "artist": "Uni Boys", "description": ", the fourth full-length record by Los Angeles’s  , largely works within the same creative mode as its predecessors: The quartet’s founding members Reza Matin and Noah Nash split songwriting duties 50/50 across 12 nervy power pop tracks packed with nimble chord progressions and retro riffage. What’s changed is the execution. While the bulk of their past work was home-taped onto Tascams and laptops, lending a rustic edge to the mix, the Boys ventured east to record the new material with Michael and Brian D’Addario: fraternal frontmen of and noted Todd Rundgren disciples. Tracks like “I’m Alright” and “Two Years” slightly de-emphasize lead guitar to create room for subtle flourishes of piano and organ, making their choruses pop with even greater contrast. The record leads with best effort, opening with standout single “Let’s Watch a Movie,” a surprisingly domestic celebration of deciding to do nothing at the end of a rough workday. Complete with handclaps and four-part, Wilsonian harmonies, it’s pure bubblegum comfort food that goes down as easily as microwaved popcorn and a 90-minute rom com. “Hiding in My Home” takes Uni Boys’s devotion to leisure a step further, abandoning the outside world for a secluded life of naps and eating takeout in the nude. The accompanying instrumentation is anything but listless, though. A taut rhythm section ties trebly leads into tight knots, each bar concluding with a clever melodic twist. Initially inspired by ‘70s power pop bands like  ,   and  , Matin and Nash balance the flamboyant songraft of their forebears with the raw, rollicking ethos of even earlier rock ‘n’ roll. “Down to the City” bolts out of the gate with a kitschy stock riff pulled straight from a late ‘50s jukebox 45 before making a detour into its zig-zagging pre-chorus, punctuated by hairpin chord changes that arrive like sucker punches. Without betraying their gritty sensibilities, Uni Boys’s studio debut pushes their already-prodigious songwriting to be more ambitious and even hookier, an intricately-crafted soundtrack for lazy days spent loafing on the couch.", "genre": ["Rock"]}
{"album": "Afternoon X", "artist": "Vanishing Twin", "description": "Until recently,  stood on the shoulders of giants. Although their excellent previous albums ( ,  , and  ) are inspired interpretations of lounge music, kosmische, dub, and jazz, they may have too readily provoked comparisons to some usual suspects such as Stereolab, Esquivel!, Sun Ra, Alain Goraguer’s soundtrack for the 1973 film  , and so on. But  , the trio’s new album, changes that, displaying transformed focus and imagination. The result is fever dream music, bad trip music, defined less by cartoonish apparitions than by existential dread; the overwhelming sense that we’re all just contours on a 2D plane. This is music to soundtrack your thumbs going weird. Whereas previous albums were built around a loose scaffolding of swinging drums and bass; analog electronic detailing; and Cathy Lucas’s impassive vocals,   exchanges this for something more unpredictable. Vanishing Twin’s songwriting now treats everything as malleable. A vocal refrain might be bit-crushed beyond recognition. The grooves are soggier and swampier (reminiscent of Pete Um and Ken Nordine’s  album), but liable to short out. Abstract rumbles and booms punctuate much of the record, evoking the molten quality of the sounds made by Italian futurist Luigi Russolo’s membrane-based noise machines. Vanishing Twin have also harnessed more fundamental musical building blocks like frequency, structure, and instrument allegiance. “Brain Weather” seems to tune into three different songs, like an automaton radio. “The Down Below” (an album highlight) is a cornucopia of strange structural shifts, interesting textural combinations, and addictive chord changes and melodies that drift in and out of the gloom. The purring bass texture in “Lotus Eater” and robot vocal processing in “Marbles” are pitched at frequencies that tickle the inside of your skull.   has a wabi-sabi quality; it feels chopped up, crushed, saturated, blown out, and remolded. The weirdness is now foundational. The first line of the first track, “Melty”, (sung with exquisite stacked harmonies) seems to herald what is to follow: “All that is solid melts into air.” The strangeness of this album is part of the roots, the atmosphere, the vessel itself. It’s somehow more immediate. It gets in your teeth. Vanishing Twin have always attempted to conjure a specific sense of place or mood. But up until now, we’ve been there before, and felt it before, the arid surface of a distant planet or a Space-Age cocktail bar, say, or a sense of cool intrigue or dreamy dissociation. On  , though, they have conjured phantasmagorical new spaces. Where does “The Down Below”—with its stop-start structure, washes of sitar, and dust clouds of slack percussion—dwell? What is the emotional tenor of “Marbles”, and those claustrophobically airless beats, chewed-up loops, slightly detuned guitar, and disembodied voices?   is the sound of a band now freed to stand alone in an uncanny valley of their own making.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Bands who tread the heavily populated middle ground with one foot in each lane must do everything in their power to avoid sounding rote, derivative, and featureless. So it says a lot that the Lafayette, Louisiana quartet Capra somehow manages to make its signature punk-metal hybrid land with a spark of freshness. Much like Capra’s 2020 debut  , the band’s sophomore effort   recaptures the initial thrill of melding these genres as if it still represented a bold step that required nerve to pull off. Indeed, Capra possesses a rare ability to induce a sense of careening toward the edge. On paper, of course, the recipe seems simple: marry the precision of metal with the anarchic energy of punk and switch gears enough to keep things interesting. Indirectly, however, Capra proves just how elusive that recipe actually is. Fans of this brand of heavy music, for example, have heard countless iterations of the brawny hardcore riff that introduces “Tied Up.” But, even before the song reaches the 40-second mark, the band executes three dynamic shifts with unparalleled agility. None of the riffs, tempos or beats from “Tied Up,” in fact, would stand out all that much by themselves. And yet, for all the times we’ve heard these same stock ingredients, we haven’t heard them quite like  . Guitarist Tyler Harper and drummer Jeremy Randazzo, who founded the band together in 2016, have a knack for playing as if their lives depended on their ability to convey enthusiasm to the audience. So much music of this ilk settles into a numbing static after several songs in a row, but Harper, Randazzo, and new bassist Trevor Alleman appear to be incapable of letting their energy falter. Meanwhile, vocalist Crow Lotus almost singlehandedly breathes new life into an enraged-screamer paradigm that sorely needed it. “It can’t be normal to feel this way,” she sings in the first verse of leadoff track “CHSF.” She continues: “I feel so empty, please god / Why can’t I connect to anyone or anything at all?” . Throughout the album, a sense of hollowness pervades, as Lotus tackles crippling depression (“CHSF,” “Obligatory Existence”), toxic shame (“Transplant”), hopelessness (“D’Arc”) and a host of other post-traumatic sensations. Lotus made a conscious decision to explore mental health issues from a more personal perspective this time. She interprets the title “Errors” as a reference to people who feel so broken inside that they see their very existence as a kind of mistake. Harper, on the other hand, views the title more from the standpoint that our mistakes provide fodder for growth. The contrast between those viewpoints propels the music on  , which thoroughly invigorates, even as it leaves haunting images in its wake.", "genre": []}
{"album": "The Father of Libyan Reggae", "artist": "Ibrahim Hesnawi", "description": "It wasn’t too long after he heard Jamaican legend Bob Marley for the first time that Ibrahim Hesnawi embarked on a decades-long music career of his own, pioneering reggae in Libya and the Arab World. Through the 1980s and into the 2000s, he amassed a sprawling catalog of more than 15 albums, highlights from which have now been compiled by Berlin-based label   Across nine tracks—many of them unheard outside North Africa until now—  offers a compact showcase of the reggae pioneer. Singing mostly in Libyan Arabic and focusing on a message of humanism and peace, Hesnawi’s goal was to bring reggae to the youth of Libya. “[Reggae lyrics] led me to create several political songs about struggles and striving for freedom myself,” Hesnawi explains in the compilation’s liner notes. “I wanted to speak about these things in my music, and I believe that’s what I was good at, and also what I became successful for.” That mission is reflected in tracks like “Al Hob Wal Salam” and “Only World,” which combine existential musings in Arabic and English with electric guitar, vibraslap, and spaced-out keyboards. Hesnawi’s vocal approach—straightforward and heartfelt—conveys his message of love and unity with ease. Tracks like “Tendme” and “Kesati” highlight  Hesnawi’s ability to build upward from a reggae foundation, adding touches of funk,  , and Libyan pop. Habibi Funk’s masterful co-curation work with Hesnawi is particularly evident on the compilation’s last two tracks,  “Enti” and “Watany Al Kabir.” It took the label years to hunt down renditions of these songs, and their brisk, bouncy melodies, keyboard stabs, and backing vocals further represent Hesnawi’s skilled pairing of Kingston reggae with modern Arabic music, and how his mission remained intact across decades of economic and political upheaval.", "genre": ["Reggae"]}

By reading an article or three, a person can learn about long-term nuclear waste warning messages, nuclear semiotics, even prehistoric-looking government repositories full of art projects—ominous, massive granite constructions designed to create a dialogue between the past and the future. That dialogue is present on the 12 tracks that comprise  , the second album from Oakland-based artist Maria BC. Fresh encounters and old recollections converse with one another in delicate vocal arrangements, sawlike electronic textures, sparse guitars, and a detuned baby Steinway piano. That beauty and vulnerability doesn’t come without pain: the lyrics explore aching memories, struggle, and grief. Crystalline synths and a rising, triumphant chorus introduce the mesmerizing “Watcher,” where obscured lyrics are woven into a trio of vocal harmonies. On “Haruspex,” Maria BC’s voice emerges alone, accompanied by electric guitar and percussion that punctuates unsettled questions (“Is my body right?”). The artist’s voice is doubled on “Return to Sender,” where menacing waves of synth form a dramatic backdrop for lyrics that detail a failed attempt at connection. With gracious defeat, the speaker concedes: “I’ll just let my answers get sent back.” The first portion of   is drawn from a palette of thoughts and questions, the music wandering in and out: part tangible dreamy melodies, part barren electronic landscape. The sense of desolation becomes more palpable, but no less exquisite, as the album goes on. On “Daydrinker,” a sustained vocalization—somber at first, then progressively more angelic—blends with reversed guitar, resulting in a dark, deep well of sound. “Still” delivers a message of finality (“Nothing is wrong/ We deserve what we deserve”) above an echoing piano that grows in volume until it becomes the centerpiece of the song. “Lacuna” (in Latin, “pit” or “gap”) is filled with chimes, giddy, glitchy effects, and throbbing vocals, a hiatus from the album’s emotional barrenness. That reprieve ends with “Mercury,” a stormy and discordant return to earlier turmoil. Throughout, Maria BC’s voice is elastic: allowing them to achieve both somber, spectral tones and celestial, victorious highs. A beautifully crafted, bracingly candid meditation on memory and personal experience,   is arresting, auspicious, and fully-formed.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "I Killed Your Dog", "artist": "L’Rain", "description": "In a   with  , Taja Cheek, the mastermind behind  , called attention to the advantages of making uncategorizable music: “If someone can’t pin down what you are, then you can be whatever you want to be,” she said of her penchant for reinvention. On her latest album,   that permission for infinite interpretability extends from artist to listener. The album is so rich with playful experimentation that it can be enjoyed as an experimental pop-soul album, a campy indie rock opera, or some other thing that only becomes clear with further listens. All of it is in service of exploring the thrills of daring to know, love, and hurt another person. Take the provocative title track on which Cheek confesses, “I killed your dog/ It made me happy,” over creeping keys and bass that—after a cue of haunting, modulated laughter—morphs into a florid swirl of horns and whooshing synths. The track pulls on a thread introduced on “Kill Self” from 2021’s  , which opens with the line, “Reverse evolve/ Kissing my dogs/ Killing myself.” “I Killed Your Dog” takes the destruction a step further, turning a confession of murder into a kind of hymn. On her previous albums, Cheek and an evolving crew of collaborators—including L’Rain mainstays Andrew Lappin and Ben Chapoteau-Katz—explored the ins and outs of grief and resilience via unconventional compositions consisting of atmospheric instrumentation and found sounds. While those albums established L’Rain as an icon of experimental music,  —which Cheek has described as her “basic bitch” album—takes a page from poppier genres without sacrificing that innovative edge. L’Rain’s characteristically quirky interludes remain—like the patchwork of zooms and bloops on “All the Days You Remember,” or the intro of “What’s That Song?” during which someone verbally describes the instrumentation that follows. But songs like “New Year’s UnResolution” step into more conventional pop music structures, using ethereal indie rock to probe the uncertainty of a new breakup and following a verse-chorus-verse path before spinning into a winding outro. Cheek’s approach to composition is often compared to sound collage, but the dynamism of the soundscapes on   casts L’Rain as a project capable of instilling its various musical elements with both artful tension and graceful slack to create rich tapestries of sound. One of those elements is the human voice—both Cheek’s and others—which rises and falls in space and tone to hold the disparate instrumental elements together. Another is guitar, which Cheek threads throughout the album letting it flourish at the forefront of tracks like “5 to 8 Hours a Day (WWwaG),” a spacey folk song about humans’ hidden capacity for surprising actions. Even on this “basic bitch”—i.e. more “approachable”—album L’Rain’s compositions and subjects challenge listeners to reconsider what they expect from popular and experimental music alike.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "Water Made Us", "artist": "Jamila Woods", "description": "On  , the latest album from Chicago-born singer, songwriter, and poet,   dissects, celebrates, and vents about the thrilling highs and gut-wrenching lows of romantic love. The album’s title comes from the raw, resolute “Good News,” in which Woods finds a faint kernel of hope by taking a bird’s eye view of a strained relationship and realizing that if she and her partner found happiness once, they might be able to find it again. She compares love to water—a fluid, generative substance which, by its very nature, can move, change, and eventually return back to its source: “The good news is we were happy once/ The good news is water always runs back where it came from/ The good news is water made us.” But before we get to love’s return, Woods takes us back to the time before the relationship reached its breaking point with album opener “Bugs.” Backed by lush bass, strings, harp, and keyboard, Woods playfully details her partner’s tics and minor annoyances. Recognizing that she ain’t perfect herself, she asks her partner to “please be patient with me.” The song is an almost too-accurate depiction of the kind of lived-in intimacy that has the power to either forge lifelong bonds or cause a long-term relationship to sink under the weight of resentment. From here, Woods walks us through the many cycles and particularities of love. “Tiny Garden,” featuring  , is a groovy, mid-tempo bop that posits love as an ongoing process of care, support, and enrichment. Before the vocal harmonies swoop in for the song’s lovely chorus, Woods assures her partner that while her love may not be dramatic and overly demonstrative, it will be nourishing and consistent. “It’s not gonna be a big production,” she sings, “It’s not butterflies or fireworks/ Said it’s gonna be a tiny garden, but I feed it every day.” All the joy, warmth, hurt, and even the mundanity that comes with love and connection turn up in songs like “Wolfsheep,” “Boomerang,” and “Headfirst.” By the time we get “Wreckage Room,” things have gone off the rails, and Woods employs the song’s spare, lonesome sound to mourn a love that couldn’t be rescued.   is an emotionally harrowing journey, a reminder that love requires openness and surrender. Sometimes, love can feel like riding raging waters; other times, it’s like being swept out into the warmth of the ocean. Most times, it’s both at once.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

By the album’s fifth track, “Wiser,” the clouds have finally started to clear: “Get a little bit wiser/ Get a little bit brighter/ Feel a little bit better/ Every day,” Dorval sings; the song gives way to instrumental bliss-out “Melancholic Serenity,” which serves a bridge to a new mood, leading Dorval into her very own paradise.

{"album": "Death is Home", "artist": "Aïsha Devi", "description": "The elements are familiar: Piercing riffs from classic trance; kickdrums from hardcore rave; the gothic tonalities of ‘80s industrial, EBM, and coldwave; the slamming rhythmic disjunctions of grime; the circling 808s of trap; androgynous, bordering-on-alien ultra-processed vocals. This particular blend of sounds has been integral to Tibetan-Nepalese-Swiss creator  s style since her first EP in 2013. And given that it no longer sounds radically new, you might think that it’s in danger of losing its edge—but that would be missing the point. First, there are sonic absolutes in play here: the use of high frequencies and the jagged leaps from silence to slamming industrial drums means the music will always have an adrenalized unease to it. Second, and even more important, this music was never about its novelty, but the fact that it provided a language for exploratory musicians like Devi to operate outside of the norms of the club and experimental electronica establishments. To put it mildly, there remains a vast amount still to be said in that language. And Aïsha Devi has always had a lot to say. Anyone who has ever witnessed her live shows will know that she is a born performer and consummate musician, and on her third album—and first in five years—that fact is clearer than ever. From the outset, it’s clear that she’s upped her production game, a fact that’s clinched by the way the piercing high-pitched synth in opener “Not Defined by the Visible” swerves and glides into complex, even joyous melodies. Throughout the album, the tension between that cold, gothic, industrial edge and pure pleasure is examined and played with. The bodily groove of trap beats and the use of pop melody on tracks like the centerpiece “Unborn Yet Alive” aren’t just affectation, they’re integral to what this record  . It’s an intense experience. Devi has talked a lot about self-realization through her art, and it’s easy to feel the sheer force of will creating something through the ritualistic processes here—the pounding second half of the album’s eight-minute closer is not for the faint of heart, but its payoff is majestic. But perhaps the album’s emblematic track is “Dimensional Spleen,” a collaboration with Kenyan producer  . The simultaneous silliness and disquieting nature of the title sets the tone for a tune that simultaneously feels like a sci-fi war machine, a rewiring of your synapses, and a whimsical pop song—albeit one sung by interdimensional sprites. There’s a lot to it, and a lot to this album in general: proof positive that this neo-gothic sound palette is maturing into something durable and deep-seated.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Fourth Album", "artist": "Markus Floats", "description": "Since his early days as a jazz-influenced punk bassist, Markus Lake has possessed an innate sense of proportion—something that’s evident not only from the colorful abstract paintings adorning the covers of his solo releases, but also from the painstakingly arranged electronic compositions he creates as  . Until now, the Montreal-based artist has worked alone in this capacity, constructing songs from archived sounds recorded on his cellphone during studies in Concordia’s Electroacoustic program. On  , Lake welcomes contributions from fellow members of the free-improv ensemble Egyptian Cotton Arkestra, lacing their instrumentation into delicate, textural works where everything remains in its right place. Explaining the way his creative process takes precedence over the finished project,  , “the painting itself is less important than… painting. The music itself is less important than making music.” For the latest in his series of generically numbered albums, Lake brought a selection of nearly completed tracks to his longtime collaborators James Goddard (saxophone, mbira), Ari Swan (violin), and Lucas Huang (guitar, drums). Spending a day at Montreal’s famed Hotel2Tango studio, these three players added spontaneous flourishes for Lake to use as supplementary building blocks. The familiar sounds of his cycling arpeggios are complemented by alternately mournful and majestic orchestration, giving  ’s songs a newfound gravitas. Borrowing a trick from  ’s sequential track titles, “AS ABOVE” and “SO BELOW” are two of the busiest pieces here, layering sawing strings and skronking sax over insistent electronics. The 31-second “Interlude” sounds like a generator sputtering to life at an outdoor punk show, while “mdhvn” could be confused with an orchestra tuning up while a computer processes advanced calculations. “Death (pt. 2)” is both the album’s thematic and literal centerpiece, tucking its quivering woodwinds, elongated violins, and the plunky metallic tines of the mbira under a blanket of ominous drones. More than any other Markus Floats song, it resembles the score for an imagined horror film, infusing eerie melodicism with tactile sound art in the style of  . In live performances, Lake integrates spoken word excerpts from revolutionary Black figures such as Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison, and Huey Newton.

Hammering home Lake’s beliefs in socially engaged collaboration and the journey sharing equal importance with its destination, Moten drops the mic with a powerfully poetic koan: “What we’ve been trying to figure out how to get to is how we are when we get together to try to figure it out.”  ", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

We return once again to Shabason’s childhood, where as a 14-year-old, he was enraptured by Toy Factory’s impossibly punk 31-minute montage of brilliance and bravado.

You can easily imagine the three members of the Cincinnati-based dance-punk trio squashed shoulder to shoulder, cheek by jowl, hunched over their studio  , furiously operating a coleslaw of wires and cityscapes of equipment. In quieter moments, there’s an audible white noise fry of switched-on electronics. Everything bleeds in. Such is the turbulent quality of the record that the vocals in tracks such as “Cheap Chrome” and “Order Imposing Sentence” seem pushed off to the side, like a manic presence somewhere just offstage; Andie Luman and Dylan McCartney sound malevolent, while Dakota Carlyle seems almost queasily uninterested. In Alan Vega fashion, the lyrics are frequently unintelligible, but random phrases occasionally emerge from the confusion—”triangles of terror!”, “disconnect!”, “elec-tric!” Although the meaning isn’t often apparent, their interplay with the monochrome, nocturnal arrangements suggests a series of disconnected vignettes in a film or book played out against the backdrop of one city on one night. (The songs even share the terse, punchy wording of pulp fiction titles—“Ending Of The Stream,” “Suspension Bridge Collapse,” “Beat Me Down.”) The meaning might not always be apparent, but the feeling always is. Although   is The Serfs’ third album, you would be forgiven for thinking it is their first. It has the ferocious, listen-to-this-immediately quality of the best debuts. There are slower moments, granted—“Spectral Analysis” is one highlight, a kind of sewage runoff from exotica music and George Michael—but this expedient style stretches across the record, with simple drum machine patterns repeating until they short out, flurries of garbled lyrics, and a barrage of electronic flotsam and jetsam like gnarled keyboard sounds and static-y textures.

Post-punk has become so enshrined in the history of rock music—and so popular that it’s been stylistically   again and again—that it’s easy to forget how revolutionary it was in the early ‘80s. Inspired by the DIY spirit of punk, but largely untethered from the musical lexicon from rock music, musicians on the bleeding edge used whatever they could get their hands on to swim against the tide of popular music and create sounds never heard before.  is a survey of how the avant-garde shaped up in an oft-ignored European nation. Even inside Switzerland, the country’s post-punk history isn’t particularly well documented. Swiss DJ and   compiler  ’s first experience with post-punk from his own country was discovering the group KonX via an Italian language music blog. Synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines became more common fixtures in rock ensembles as the technology became more accessible, but KonX was unique in that everything was created digitally in frontman Peter Felippi’s Electronic Music Multitrack studio.

Concertgoers hoping for similar symphonic stylings to the headlining band were sorely disappointed and the organizers asked The Navarones to leave (though they ignored the request and continued to play). “Kabyl Marabù” offers some clues why the crowd might not have been ready: its wonky tempo and sprechgesang vocal delivery is augmented with bizarre samples like chirping birds, croaking frogs, and jingling coins.

There is a sense of wonder, joy, and musical discovery in Gardner’s and McCombs’ compositions. Playing with words and repetition while ingeniously describing the attributes of owls and the human body respectively, tracks like “I’m a Nocturnal Animal” and “My Skull Is Made Out Of Bone,” make the case that highlighting children’s voices and interests, rather than dumbing things down, creates a more compelling, pleasant listen for everyone. In collaboration with McCombs and through his work as an educator, Gardner brings out the best elements for which the Bay Area (where he lives and teaches) is historically and culturally cherished: idealism, musical innovation, and equality. “Wave A Flag For Harvey Milk,” sung along with the San Francisco Gay Men’s Choir, takes a stand for activism and LGBTQ+ rights; “Roll Around Downtown” covers the city’s rich skateboarding history; and “Oona Louise, My Friend,” with its mellow keyboard and pensive vocals, could appear on any of the  .

{"album": "Hard Light", "artist": "Drop Nineteens", "description": "Three decades after their original run, cult shoegaze band Drop Nineteens have been rediscovered by a new legion of listeners. Songs from the Boston group’s 1992 debut,  , like their noise-pop tribute to Winona Ryder and the nearly nine-minute drifter “Kick the Tragedy,” now rack up hundreds of thousands of streams per month. Recorded while Drop Nineteens’ members were still university students,   earned critical acclaim upon its release, yet the quintet only survived several years before disbanding. This made the announcement of their original line-up’s reunion all the more surprising, with a comeback album that feels like their Jazzmasters never left their hands. Drop Nineteens rarely fit comfortably into the shoegaze mold, with songs like  ’s “Reberrymemberer” featuring  -style screams and their 1993 sophomore album   embracing shiny alt-rock hooks. On  the quintet continue to color outside of genre lines, blurring the distinctions between dream pop and Midwest emo on “Gal,” toying with morose jangle on “Tarantula,” and delving into psychedelia with the backmasked effects of “A Hitch.” As the years have passed between releases, Drop Nineteens have developed a newfound sense of patience, letting songs breathe with lengthy instrumental passages before vocals appear. While their shimmering riffs ring out, the drums and bass are kept sparse, maintaining hypnotic pulses via mid-tempo motorik rhythms. Dual guitarists/vocalists Greg Ackell and Paula Kelley haven’t lost their chemistry, with his understated delivery perfectly complemented by her whispery cooing. Kelley takes the lead on “The Price Was High,” accenting her voice with plucked acoustic guitar, and processing it through electronic effects on the Clientele cover   The soaring harmonies of “Scapa Flow” are reminiscent of  , while the melodic minimalism of “Lookout” could be mistaken for an Ira Kaplan song by  .   concludes with “T,” this album’s answer to  ’s “Kick the Tragedy,” as a lumbering breakbeat loops through seven minutes of shoegaze bliss.

{"album": "A Stranger That You Met Before", "artist": "A Day Without Love", "description": "A Day Without Love is the musical nom de plume of Philly-born singer and songwriter, Brian Walker. Now based in Boston, Walker’s latest album,   is an emotionally rich love letter to the independent music scene and the camaraderie found within it. As ambitious as it is heartfelt, Walker’s punky, baroque-folk songs practically glow with wit and insightful observations on the nature of community and the music scene. The album opens with “House”, a bittersweet song about the simple yet powerful joy of playing house shows. Surrounded by a small, dramatic string arrangement, Walker dryly makes a pitch in an attempt to book a gig: “I wanna play in your house…let’s pretend that we’re friends, so I don’t have to be alone.” “Diy or Die” is a funny take on the distinction between music made for love and music for money. While the concept of “DIY vs corporate” ignores the nuances of art and commerce, Walker’s dry humor sells the sentiment, with brutally cavalier lines like, “I sing in houses and you sing for corporate/ I know that one of us sucks”. “Make It Count” kicks the energy up for a rocking ode to the ins and outs of touring. Over a bouncy, midtempo groove, Walker posits touring and performance itself as an outlet through which one can express their truest self. Walker’s lyrics here are as direct as ever, stating the song’s mission statement with utmost sincerity: “I want to go on tour/ Share my words and feel seen and heard.” Friendship is a core theme that runs throughout  . On songs like “Show Friends” and “Good Friends are Hard to Find,” Walker addresses the complicated nature of friendship and socializing within the music ecosystem. In the world of gigs, tours, and performances, friendship can be fleeting, conditional, transactional and, sometimes, genuine. Despite all this, the real relationships still matter, and music can often be the ultimate social lubricant, allowing performers and listeners alike to share and connect deeply, and without pretense.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "I Will Make A Baby In This Damn Economy", "artist": "Fat Tony and Taydex", "description": "It’s increasingly hard to avoid getting swept up in the outrage cycle that seeks to define everyday life. It takes only a few moments of looking at your phone to fall into the repetitive rhythm of first getting angry and then getting exhausted. Cultivating joy is therefore a revolutionary act, a way to stare down and stand tall against the harsh waves of oppression constantly crashing against us—it’s a chance, even for a second, to envision a better future.   feels like a foundational text in the movement to counteract our daily dread. Houston-raised, Los Angeles-based rapper   and L.A. producer   first linked to create   a wide grin of a record that dropped just before the pandemic hit in 2020. That album was weird and wonderful, bright and long-lasting enough to pierce the tumult and darkness of that year. With  , they’re back to offer another jubilant, multicolored slab of electro hip-hop specifically designed for These Trying Times. In an age where it’s easy to wallow in the darkness, Fat Tony and Taydex choose instead to put on a nice fit, pour a shot of mezcal over an oversized ice cube, roll a blunt, and simply vibe. Taydex supplies Tony with rapturous production combining Southern rap’s trunk-rattling chug with sparkling dance music grooves. The duo switches between these styles effortlessly; their chemistry is palpable. It’s clear they had a blast putting this music together. The lumbering bass, 808 claps, and skittering hi-hats on songs like “Opportunist Convention” or the Paul Wall-featuring “Baby Boy” tip their cap to Tony’s native Texas. The disco throb of “Loosen Up” could get a skating rink moving, while the hyperactive house beat of “Vibe Check” feels primed to wreck a dancefloor. Tony’s writing tends to lean towards endearingly low-stakes topics like the importance of friendship (“Alexis”) or the necessity of occasional wild nights (“Kickin’ In”), but every now and then he throws in moments of stark self-reflection like a drunk driving scare (“Baby Boy”) or the need for alone time (“Don’t Tap In”). The final two tracks hold the key to unlocking the album. In the titular song, Tony is starry-eyed, gazing into the distance and imagining how having a kid could bring new levels of happiness to both himself and his relationship. He tosses off a joke that it’s in his wiring: “I did 23 and Me back in May/ Found that I’m predominantly African in my DNA/ Since that day, my spirit been trying me/ It wants to impregnate five women and start a dynasty.” The third verse flashes forward three years in the future, Tony and his partner in awe of their toddler, experiencing a love they previously couldn’t fathom. The sobering “Jasper, TX” is a reminder of what lurks in the background, of why these moments of glee are so important. Over Taydex’s somber, shuffling beat, Tony tells the story of James Byrd, Jr., a Black man lynched in East Texas in 1998. It’s a stark reminder of the ever-present hatred and darkness embedded in the heart of the U.S. It colors every interaction, turning things like enjoying a beautiful day or calling a friend to say you love them into impactful moments of resistance. Placing “Jasper, TX” at the end of the record is a brilliant move—it makes  y a beautiful, big-hearted, radical piece of art.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "Rap"]}
{"album": "SUM", "artist": "위댄스 (Wedance)", "description": "Seoul-based indie pop duo   has had a unique presence in Korea’s underground since forming in 2011. Their actual musical output belies their online footprint; their latest album   is their second for Beeline Records, but for almost a decade their DIY recordings could only be bought at shows. With upwards of 16 CDs in their   series, they also released three   CDs with remastered versions of live songs, and in 2017 they dropped their “debut” album 하고 싶은 게 많고 너도 그래 보여 . Their live   feature the duo, consisting of Wegui (guitar) and Wevo (vocals), showing off their eccentric dance moves and thrifted outfits—but underneath their playful drum machine beats has always been a touch of melancholy. On   (meaning “breath” in Korean), they lean deeper into the interplay between dance and emotion, expressing an appreciation for the breath that connects body and mind. “I think feeling sad is not confined, it is an emotion that is in constant movement,” Wevo told Senggi Studio in an   earlier in August. On record, title track “SUM” has a swaying, Radio Dept-esque shimmer, yet in their performance for Senggi Wevo swings her arms and runs in place with exaggerated motions during the song’s emotional peak. “When we practiced this song, I really cried a lot,” said Wevo in the same interview. The juxtaposition of exuberance and sadness is part and parcel of their live performance, and on the record itself you can hear hints. Wevo’s aloof, half-whispered vocals carry that vague sense of sorrow through more upbeat songs like “Curiosity Days” and “Silk Shirts.” It’s only on the final track “Thin Line” that the grittiness that characterized their previous effort   fully rears its head; the rest of the album is propelled by bright drum machines, reverbed-out guitar riffs, and Wevo’s detached lyrics. Like the music itself, Wedance’s lyrics are deceptively simple. “Silk Shirts” is especially layered, ostensibly about Wevo’s experience of wearing one of her dad’s silk shirts: “오늘 난 실크 셔츠를 입어 / 바람이 팔 등을 간지려” (Today I wear a silk shirt/ The wind tickles the back of my arms). Later, she sings “저마다 가진 것을 뽐내며 /가진 게 없는 사람은 그걸 뽐내며” (Everyone shows off what they have/ Those without anything show that off too). It’s a breezy bit of advice for living in the fast-paced materialism of the South Korean capital. They slow things down on “We Exist,” while continuing to dispense bits of wisdom: “Not what you’re good at/ Do something fun for you.” In the wide-eyed earnestness on display here, Wedance reminds us to dance, to feel, and to breathe—that existence itself relies on these small things that are easily forgotten.", "genre": ["Pop", "indie pop"]}

{"album": "Poppa Zesque", "artist": "Josh Caffe", "description": " is a London-raised DJ and producer who has released a streak of fantastic singles and EPs throughout the last few years. By virtue of the proximity of their origins and shared influences, house and techno have always been musical siblings (or at least cousins). With his uptempo, percussion-heavy production, Caffe’s music acts as a safe meeting ground between the two genres. On his debut full-length,  , Caffee offers a fiery collection of dark electronic tunes that tap into the hedonism and sexual abandon of the best dance music. The album opens with “Justify My Sex” (feat. Al White). Built upon a percolating drum groove, “Justify My Sex” finds Cafee delivering an ominous-sounding monologue similar to Adonis’s 1986 Chicago acid classic “No Way Back.” As the driving beat chugs along, Caffee confesses, “I never used to be the kind of guy that could say the word sex without blushing, but I can now…sex!” “Meine Lederjeans” opens with buttery vocal harmonies that are quickly replaced by a booming kick-snare pattern. With its electrified beat and cheeky come-ons asking the listener, “Do you like my tight jeans?” “Meine Lederjeans” is just the type of oddball, leftfield dance cut that would’ve gotten play at famed ‘80s dance clubs like The Paradise Garage or Danceteria. “Do You Want to Take Me Home” is a minimal, homespun house tune with a simple synth melody and lo-fi drums. With its direct, repeated chorus, Caffee offers to go home with a potential lover, making for pure seduction on wax. “The Rent Boys Want Their Money Back” is a clanging, Kraftwerk meets Prince-style jam. Anchored by synths and drum machines, the song feels futuristic and lo-tech, and the line “Let me be or I’ll explode” aptly represents the album’s sexually liberatory stance. There’s a reason why nightclubs have safe spaces for sexual expression for decades. Cloaked in darkness and far removed from the judgmental eye of parents, family, and neighbors, the dancefloor and the dynamic club cultures that emerge from it are tailor-made for sexual exploration, assertion, and revolution.   understands the emancipatory power of dance music, and that energy is deeply etched into the contours of each track.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Careful!", "artist": "Deeper", "description": "It’s aptly named, at the end of the day.  , the title of  ’s third album, is a mantra that seems to run through its 13 handsome cuts like a cautionary message in a stick of Brighton rock. The Chicago quartet (Nic Gohl, Kevin Fairbairn, Drew McBride, and Shiraz Bhatti) are forever keeping a steady hand on the tiller—they ensure that for every crisp, scrubbed guitar line, there’s a buttery synthesizer chord; for each clutch of blistering tunes, there’s an electronic palette cleanser. Everything feels almost mathematically well balanced. Artists seldom lavish such care and attention on dynamic contrast and structural shifts. Even those to which one might immediately compare Deeper can occasionally be accused of getting high on their own supply:   and   are fine bands, but Deeper complicate their fondness for intricate, spiky guitars, motorik rhythms, and declarative singing with unashamedly pretty melodies, buttery synthesizers, and goth rock detailing. Singer and guitarist Nic Gohl’s enigmatic—blank, even—lyrical statements such as “And when the trouble sets in” and “I heard the message” are contrasted by anthemic choruses like “It’s the right kind of rhythm” or “I am blinded/ I am seeing things.” These switch-ups make for moments on each song that wrongfoot you. “Build A Bridge” begins like a jerky post-punk banger but morphs into something more big-hearted, complete with falsetto singing and a brash, almost trance-y keyboard melody—maybe it sounds a bit like The Killers when Brandon Flowers wore a sneer and you fully appreciated why they were named after a  . It’s telling that Gohl glosses   as “pop music, basically.” This is not to say it lacks character or is particularly chorus-focused, but that it has pop music’s deftness, its immediacy. There might be a minor chord that seems to say “this is sad, and what of it?” or a brilliantly whistle-able melody. “Tele” has the feel of a long-lost Cult or Nine Inch Nails classic, while “Bite” begins as The Cure-by-numbers but soon opens up with the additions of a massed chorus of voices and beautiful, chiming guitar parts; “Pressure” is a wistful sonic goodbye-wave, the kind of thing that might soundtrack the denouement of a last-summer-of-freedom-type indie film.  is packed with this vein of Great Songs, Great Songs that boast melodies on which you could mortgage a speedboat—think The Cars, or XTC, or even TOY’s severely underrated 2016 third album   (which shares a similar sonic palette with  ).

On his debut,  , D.C.-born and London-based singer-songwriter   pulls from the R&B greats of the past to inspire his rich meditations on love. The album’s opener and title track, “Come Around and Love Me,” is built on a slick groove and a Thom Bell-style string arrangement. When the strings are paired with vibraphone, and Ngonda’s soaring falsetto, the tune recalls the elegance and grace of the finest Philly soul 45s of the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. “If You Don’t Want My Love” is a dramatic midtempo bop complete with strings and some tasteful, Bobby Eli-style guitar. Ngonda’s voice is dynamic as he reassures his lover that he thinks the world of them and surely couldn’t live without their love. Beyond Ngonda’s sweet-yet-over-the-top proclamations, he issues a soft ultimatum in the form of the chorus: “If you never wanted my love…let me know.” In addition to the clear nods to Philly soul in the arrangements, Ngonda’s songs possess another quality inspired by the great R&B canon of the past. There’s an emotional tone struck throughout these songs that feels very similar to the swooning devotional style of Smokey Robinson. “Lost” and “What A Difference She Made” present this influence in the form of a slow love ballad. “Lost,” in particular, pulls from the same musical and emotional reservoir of Harold Melvin & The Bluenote’s “I Miss You.” When Ngonda sings, “I’m lost without you/ I’m lost, and I can’t seem to find my way,” listeners can practically taste the desperation and sorrow of a sweet love gone sour. The depth of feeling that Ngonda is able to mine throughout  is a reminder of the importance that romantic love plays in our lives. When the matters of the heart are all good and aligned, there are few greater joys, and when that love goes bad, it can feel like the end of the world itself.", "genre": []}

By releasing itself from the sole proprietorship of the party, rap music opened up a little more space for artists to mine a new introspective sensibility.  , the latest album from East Cleveland-born rapper and producer Kipp Stone, is as introspective and conflicted as it gets. Written and recorded solely by Stone, the album offers an in-depth exploration of the artist’s rich internal world. The album opens with “BLVD Intro,” a gorgeous tune built around a subtle, mid-tempo beat and smooth vocal harmonies. Stone enters at the song’s midway point with a verse full of longing, both romantic and financial. His pen straddles the line between confident and self-pitying as he hits us with bombshell lines like “Shit you hate about yourself, be what they love you for the most.” “Petrichor” is built around dreamy keys and a slow rhythm section. Stone opens up fully, putting his shortcomings, insecurities, hopes, and ambitions on full display. It’s an interesting contrast to a song like “Vanderhall Venice,” a breezy, optimistic tune in which Stone confesses, “I ain’t felt this free in all my life.” ’s production is handled by a cadre of producers, including Tunga,  , Endless, BeatsByEmani, Mides, eeryskies,  , Stoic, and Kipp himself. Despite this by-committee approach, the music throughout the album has a consistent aesthetic: soulful keys and groovy drums and basslines.

Blind Equation started making MIDIgrind a decade ago. Silly and baroque, their first full-length   had enough attention to detail to be entertaining.

At times, it reaches Hawthorne Heights levels of screamo sincerity, as on “you betrayed the ones you loved.” Elsewhere, featured artists including   help Blind Equation plumb the depths of depression over synth squalls that approach 250bpm.

Unlike   and other earlier releases,  does take moments to slow down and open up. The delicate floral cover art reflects this. Closer “the last glimpse of me” doesn’t dip into grindcore textures until toward the end and clocks in at nearly five minutes. Rather than compressing their emotions into bricked-out, sub-two-minute compositions, Blind Equation seem more willing to ruminate. That expansiveness shows up in the lyrics and vocals. James McHenry’s fatalistic songwriting builds on the precedents he set on 2021’s  contains more cleans, more grand washes behind the freakout melodies, more big feels.

Though still in their infancy, film and radio were transforming into commercial industries by the first decade of the 1900s. The recording industry, too, was crystallizing during these critical years. The gramophone—an early version of the record player which improved upon Thomas Edison’s phonograph—became a mass-produced item that ordinary folks could obtain. Recording equipment became more practical and more portable, allowing engineers to travel the world and capture live music. These two developments in tandem meant you no longer had to be in the room with musicians to hear them play; music could come from anywhere and be heard everywhere. As record dealers spread out across the Caribbean islands and explored the possibilities of this new medium, they found a diversity of music around every corner.  collects a small fraction of the sounds sealed in shellac during this frenzy, reissuing most of them for the first time since their original issue over a century ago. Many of the songs on this compilation tell stories that immortalize ephemeral moments. Coro Chambelona’s “Son de la Chambelona” manifested from one of Cuba’s first political protest songs, written by opponents of conservative president Mario García Menocal during the 1916 election season. The original “La Chambelona” brutally mocked the divisive leader, but Victor Records took the unusual step of requesting the political lyrics be omitted so that the record would still be marketable in the event of Menocal winning re-election. (He did win.) In their place, an improvised bugle riff and a percussion suite of repurposed gardening tools give it a unique slapdash charm. The song eventually shed its political baggage and remains one of the most popular Cuban congas. The musicians represented on   also vary in levels of fame. Lionel Belasco is a monumentally important figure in the history of music from the West Indies. A pioneering   and ambassador for the then-young genre, he traveled the Caribbean extensively, adding tunes from all over the islands to his repertoire and popularizing them internationally. This version of “Buddy Abraham” was chronicled during a stay in New York City that he decided to make permanent; he would continue playing Caribbean music in the United States for the rest of his life. By contrast, little information remains about the performers of “Las Vacaciones.” The notes accompanying the session label it a   (school song), and it does appear to feature a choir of young students, possibly accompanied by teachers on piano and violin. The circumstances of the amateur recording from San Juan have mostly eroded to time, but still hold precious details of Caribbean music history. Record labels were still a brave new world when these early Caribbean recordings were pressed; engineers didn’t have the benefit of sales and marketing information to guide their choices, resulting in a surprisingly comprehensive survey of the local music of a disparate geographical area. The activity of labels around this time could be considered an early musicological event, but the science was imperfect and marred by motives of profit; context was often stripped from the final product.

After all, her early work in  ’s Guardian Alien project often felt like a frantic séance or a one-way ticket on a bullet train to pure transcendence (see: their   and the side-long title track sequences of  ). Eartheater’s opening salvos for Hausu Mountain (2015’s   and  ) were also wild and otherworldly, but listen closely, and you’ll hear how they hint at the heavenly vocal hooks to come.

It was the first time Eartheater let outside producers like  ,   and   past the pearly gates of her self-made sound world for an entire album. Listen to it alongside Eartheater’s subsequent albums (  and its calming director’s cut  ) and everything Eartheater has been working towards over the past decade starts to make perfect sense. Namely her ever-evolving vision of what truly experimental pop tracks should sound like—a feeling reinforced by  ’ initial sessions at LA’s illustrious Sunset Sound recording studio. To give you an idea of how storied its CV is, parts of   and   were both recorded there. Not to mention   hit “Let It Go,” and the audio side of such Disney movies as  and  . The latter is actually interpolated on  ’ speaker-panning opener “Sugarcane Switch.” As strings rise with the tides of a lumbering bass line and palpitating drums, Eartheater sings about how “a spoonful of sugar” can “help the medicine go down on me.” Her sly turn of phrase is more than a mere homage to Hollywood’s favorite housekeeper; it’s a telling sign of the scientific, and metaphorical, symbolism that lurks just beneath the album’s surface. Or as she put it in a press release, “  is a series of vignettes about the process of breaking things down. Once a substance is ground down to powder, it’s in its tiniest molecular state, enabling it to then be integrated into something new.” Musically speaking,  finds much of its power in minimalism and making every last sound count. Striking a perfect balance between her orchestral side (the LEYA collab  , the avant-garde chamber arrangements of  , the   she composed for   in 2019) and strengths as a singer, songwriter, and producer, its nine songs were sanded and polished at several different studios with the help of such close friends and collaborators as  ,   and  .

One reason may be Eartheater’s tendency to reconcile her past with her present, whether that means cutting a devastating System of a Down cover (“Chop Suey,” something she covered with an acoustic guitar in high school) or melding a rusty iPhone recording of her family playing mandolin, guitar and violin with cloudy effects and woozy vocals (“Salt of the Earth [H2ome]”). Centering its hi-def sound on slick breaks (“Crushing”), ecstatic choruses (“Pure Smile Snake Venom”) and woofer-wrecking rhythms (“Powder”) certainly doesn’t hurt either. Ask Eartheater to sum everything up with a sentence and she’ll tell you   is her “LA record”. That’s selling it short, though.

{"album": "Techxodus", "artist": "Speaker Music", "description": "In Black music, technology has never been solely a means to an end.

By nature of the sociopolitical context in which Black music exists, the music that we make requires a liberatory imperative. The work of musician/theorist DeForrest Brown Jr. (aka  ) is grounded in Black liberation praxis while questioning what liberation looks like and how music serves that aim. On his previous album, 2020’s  , Brown used his dynamic Detroit techno and ambient-influenced compositions to posit Black music itself as a liberation technology. Brown builds on that premise with his latest album,  .  opens with “D.T.A.W.O. (Deprogramming The Atonist World Order).” Amidst a dreamy, looping synth, Brown appears to state a direct but novel mission statement: “Black music that sounds technological rather than music made with technology.” By focusing on the technological character of Black music, Brown aligns himself with a long continuum of Black artists and thinkers like Octavia Butler, Sun Ra, and more who channel speculative art into a revolutionary creative practice. As the track’s intensity builds, pillowy kick drums echo through the soundscape creating a faint cardiovascular-like rhythm. “Techno-Vernacular Phreak” comes next with syncopated kicks, snares, and toms that call to mind the complex drumming language of jazz. “Holosonic Rebellion” opens with skittering hi-hats supporting a drifting ambient soundscape. The music here builds patiently as sounds are allowed to enter and recede without hurry. A handful of samples point to the thematic content of “Holosonic Rebellion” as screams, crashes, and conflict help narrate the sound of a violent uprising. As part of the cultural lifeblood of Black people, Black music has always been a key tool in our collective fight on multiple fronts. Myth, spirit, politics, culture, aesthetics and beyond, the Black experience worldwide is characterized by an ongoing fight for survival, dignity, and freedom.   presents us with a soundtrack for this struggle as well as an intellectual framework which we can use to contemplate our relationship to technology and the future.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

They’re a nice way into Subsonic Eye (and their new album,  ) who do their best to sound reserved and chilly (all clean lines and choppy rhythms) but can’t help themselves from occasionally breaking out into something more tender. Although the group’s third album,  , detailed the “natural world fast disappearing,” on  , they decided to explore nature’s co-existence with “urban cities.” It’s easy to see how this has translated into the songs, which seem built from glass, metal, poured concrete, and polished stone. The production sounds almost steam-cleaned—there’s the transparency of math rock, the flat arrangement style of dream pop, and dry, metallic guitar sounds borrowed from post-rock. There’s a certain opacity to tracks like “J-O-B” and “Machine”; they’re slippery and difficult to judge the emotional tenor of. The breathlessness of “Circle” and “Performative” (the latter a contender for one of the tracks of the year—it’s  ) conjures the feel of cars rushing around junctions or streets bustling with people. These songs whirl and flurry, but never quite settle. The album is not totally impenetrable, though. Wahidah acts as a kind of tour guide to millennial life in the big city, uninterestedly discussing “charging laptops, ticking boxes,” yoga, or capitalism; sometimes her singing might dissolve into muffled unintelligibility, like she just can’t be bothered to be heard above the metropolis’ industrial roar. Furthermore, brief moments of respite—like a pretty chord change; a glowing, liquid guitar line; or a yodeling voice crack—can also throw an entire song into relief, like the sun peeking through clouds onto a skyscraper and making you notice, however momentarily, the powerful curves, the mosaic-like glass, and the tiny people inside.", "genre": ["Alternative", "dream pop"]}

Amongst all this high-level activity, Marc Richter managed to stand out. His 2009 album  released under the name , mixed vinyl samples, field recordings, odd electronics, and good old acoustic instruments into compelling sonic scenes, resulting in one of the best records of that year. In the time since, Richter has made multiple Black to Comm albums for  , while also releasing music under his own name and as   and    (in which he uses vocal snippets from pop music clips on YouTube). But before all that, Richter began creating a follow-up to  and now he’s finally unearthed this material. On the 18-track, 40-minute  , he’s as open to all sounds as he was on  , mining such diverse sources as an out-of-tune piano, children singing, pristine acoustic guitar, and classic synthesizers. The album echoes his achievements from 14 years ago, but also sounds great in the here and now. Even more so than on  Richter presents his ideas in bite-sized chunks, with no track lasting more than four and a half minutes, and many clocking in at two minutes or less. These short windows of sound—along with the fact that no two songs use the same instrumentation—allow Richter to intensely explore just a few ideas on each piece. On the chiming “Geburt der Pferde,” strums circle and overlap, as if presented from multiple angles. A similar effect comes from piano chords during “Zweitausendzweiundzwanzig,” which Richter melts into glitches and whirrs. A bracing take on the traditional Welsh tune “Iechyd o Gylch” offers metallic strains from a digital approximation of the African string instrument known as the  . And in  ’s most moving track, “Europamusik,” Richter morphs back-and-forth, accordion-like tones into reverberating chants of disembodied voices. It’s during those kinds of uncanny juxtapositions that Richter’s aesthetic comes across strongest. He can evoke deep emotions and complex memories with just a single sound. His music always feels inherently reflective, and  ’s status as a sequel to an older album just adds to that past-within-the-past aura. But like the work of   (whose 2014 album   similarly furthered a previous effort, 2001’s  ), Richter’s music never sounds like an aging relic.

{"album": "Marzipan", "artist": "Charif Megarbane", "description": " and Charif Megarbane—a partnership conceived in paradise. For almost six years, the Germany-based label Habibi Funk has been doing cherished work, reissuing old music from North Africa and the Middle East that gives prominence to local artists, indigenous styles, and region-relevant social and political messages. Megarbane is a native of Lebanon and a Bandcamp all-star who, since 2005,  —mostly under the big tent of his label  —and under various aliases, such as   Mutual admiration has long existed between both parties, and Habibi Funk has waited years for that admiration to blossom into collaboration.

On  , he clearly understands the Habibi Funk brief. For this release, Megarbane has coined the phrase “Lebrary music,” a vision of Lebanon presented as instrumental library music cuts. The archetypal one-man band, he layers his vivid soundscapes with various guitars, bass, piano, electric sitar, Mellotron, Wurlitzer, Rhodes, vibraphone, melodica, flute, and more. Occasionally Megarbane’s deep voice can be heard in the background, complimenting his orchestration with some light  melodies. The first sounds you hear on opener “Souk el Ahad” are from a Suzuki-made electric  , a Japanese instrument, that slips into an arrangement containing some of the same genetic code as the rollicking rock ‘n’ roll tunes of  , a popular Sudanese musician whose 1960s work has been  .

Despite these personal touches,   has a grainy 35mm film reel sweep—on the panoramic “Abou Boutros,” you can picture the handsome hero of the piece cruising the streets of Beirut.

{"album": "New Future City Radio", "artist": "Damon Locks and Rob Mazurek", "description": "On February 9th, 1996, the day after signing the Telecommunications Act of 1996, President Bill Clinton predicted in an address to the nation that the bill would help “bring the future to our doorstep.” Tantamount to a wholesale deregulation of the broadcast market, that Act has dramatically impacted every aspect of the media landscape, especially radio. One deregulatory measure was lifting the cap on ownership in local media markets, allowing for massive corporations to monopolize markets nationwide. In the 27 years since, we’ve seen companies like iHeart (fka Clear Channel) effectively wipe out local, independent alternatives. This dynamic has hurt independent music and news and severely limited the power of radio as an instrument for social change.  the latest album from   and  , envisions an alternative for radio and its potential to shape the future. Structured like a mixtape recorded from bits of distant pirate radio broadcasts,  presents us with some important questions about how communities resist and how information is disseminated. The album opens with “5-4-3-2-1,” an intro/station identification introducing us to New Future Radio, a station broadcasting 24/7 “from rooftops unknown.” The hazy distorted texture of the signal contrasts with the robust sound of commercial radio, and the station’s tagline, “Tomorrow is listening,” suggests that this broadcast is not a vehicle for entertainment as much as it is a clarion call. Much like how the music broadcasted on terrestrial radio is colored by compression, the sounds on   are processed through a variety of effects, twisting and distorting everything that we hear. “The Sun Returns” is a spot for one of the station’s weekly overnight shows. The blown out sound makes the clip feel like it’s beaming in from the distant past, while the announcer, Rosetta Carr, promises that the show will tell us “what the new future can bring to you.” The music throughout   reflects the station’s radical ethos as Manzurek, Locks, and company guide us through a rich sonic maze of free jazz, reggae loops, electronic beats, and more. The album’s opener “Yes!” is a standout that hints at the scope of New Future City Radio, throwing us into a chaotic sonic mix of booming kicks and snares and a clattering percussion loop. Locks’s vocal performance here is bombastic and sure as he addresses the listener directly: “You ask me if I can form myself into a giant robot and swallow up this black hole and free the entire universe? My answer to you is: Yes!” With this salvo, Locks and Mazurek inform us that the revolution that New Future Radio is broadcasting has sweeping, even cosmic implications. ", "genre": ["Electronic", "free jazz", "beats"]}

The muscular, meaty riffing of guitarists Jon Kunz and Zak Carter is the center of the album’s universe, as it should be. Death metal lives and dies by the riff, and Kunz and Carter have assembled quite the arsenal. Whether they’re pounding away at chunky, hardcore-inspired parts or sliding down the fretboard to instigate some melodic carnage, they sound totally in control. Just as impressive is the nimble rhythm section of drummer Paul Chrismer and bassist Derrick Vella—also of Canadian greats  , perhaps Outer Heaven’s closest analogue.

{"album": "Circus Underwater", "artist": "Circus Underwater", "description": "It’s a testament to Circus Underwater’s foresighted music that if their self-titled debut album were released today, it might sound a little old hat—the response might even be something along the lines of “so what?” As it stands, these thirteen tracks are a Rosetta Stone for ambient music, dub techno, electronica and beyond. In  , you might hear traces of Four Tet’s crisp folktronica, Craven Faults’ widescreen atmospherics, or even Drexciya’s pulsing, aquatic-themed electro. In  , you can just about sense in embryo new forms of switched-on music yet to come, clamoring to be heard. Circus Underwater were a Maryland duo made up of Richard Sales and Jay Yarnall. Initially Dead Heads and hippies, in the early 1980s they applied the sonic boundary-pushing attitude of the 1960s to the new possibilities offered by the developments in electronic synthesis. (This is a leap that many in the 1960s failed to make). The result was a collection of pieces that meld futuristic drum machines, synthesizers, and electronic textures with the heady pulse of prog and the organic rattle and roll of American primitive guitar. Imagine Bobby Frank Brown being produced by Tangerine Dream, and you’re halfway there. The through line between this confluence of sounds is a sense of the hypnotic. Whether it’s the droning synths on “Entrance of the Deacon”, or the spiraling guitars on “Thunder Daughters Underwater”, or even the depths of reverb on “Weeping of Electric Sheep”, Circus Underwater create immersive worlds that slowly pull you under—after all, things only swim into view when you submerge yourself completely. The most tantalizing track here is “The Surface Of The Water”. A dub odyssey with cascading, Beach Boys-esque harmonies, fathoms-deep bass, and a gentle, almost aching wistfulness, it’s probably the best thing on here, and offers a tantalizing glimpse of what a vocal-led album might sound like. Sadly, we’ll never know. Circus Underwater ceased to be after the release of their debut. Although this music might, to us in 2023, seem chunky and old and lovely, like a boxy television that needs a minute to warm up, with exposed diodes and resistors and a big, saturated, technicolor screen, for those select few who were listening in 1984,   might just have sounded like the future.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Black Weirdo", "artist": "Kilamanzego", "description": "Black folks, and the innovation we pour into our music, has served as a central, energizing component of the last century of popular music. Despite this—and the money that Black music generates—Black people (especially poor Black people) still exist on the margins. This marginalization is not just the result of the brutal carceral system or the political and economic disenfranchisement we endure; being Black in an anti-Black world also comes with a host of societal expectations that can feel like constraints. Our bodies, our speech, clothing, hair, our attitudes, gender expression—every aspect of Black personhood is offered up for critique by a world that has shown little care for our health and well-being. What does it mean to be Black and forced to the margins while simultaneously being subjected to inhuman levels of scrutiny? , the latest EP from Philadelphia producer and sound designer  , confronts those questions. A Bronx-born woman of Ghanaian heritage, Kilamanzego has traveled in both the hardcore punk and electronic scenes, and that background is reflected in the complexity of her music. A departure from her previous work,   adds guitar and vocals to Kilamanzego’s sound, resulting in a strange and powerful mix of dense electronic tunes topped with earnest, shouty vocals. Opener “Remember Myself” starts with a dreamy four-chord synth progression before a lightfooted jungle break, bass, and distorted synth slowly join it in the foreground. From behind a veil of crunchy distortion, Kilamanzego repeats the lyrics, “I remember me just fine/ I’m an outsider I”—a mantra of self-acceptance cutting through the noise and chaos. “As I Wanna Be” combines a halftime kick and snare pattern, with synths that squirm and buzz. The lilting melody of the song’s A section is contrasted with its back half, when a dark, thick bassline is introduced and Kilamanzego’s reflects on the pain of being Black in a deeply anti-Black world: This world, this dream Hate and passion ripping at my seams Their world, their dream Tears away everything I wanna be! The intro to “Irregular” ushers in a dreamy and uplifting mood. Bits of percussion and assorted synths drift in and out of focus, as the lyrics ask why the world we live in is so cold, and why so many people have allowed that coldness into their hearts. Despite its bleak theme, the song ends on a note of possibility, as Kilamanzego presents a choice: “Find your luck, or go it all alone.” The album’s title track arrives at the end, and it pulls together the album’s themes over a rich bed of chords and an arrangement that builds to the point of euphoria. As Kilamanzego introduces and layers new sounds, her words target the stifling expectations placed on Black folks who won’t—or can’t?—conform to society’s expectations. A powerful declaration of self,   is heavy with the history of countless Black electronic musicians who’ve built lives and created art outside of the established margins. It can all be summed up by the final song’s simple refrain: “I’m a Black weirdo just tryna breathe.”", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Over Williams’s airy, gospel, and soul-informed beats, Sharif patiently recited a string of apparently disconnected phrases—from “Arsenic”: “ , sickening/ Missing moment/ Spit appointment, twisting/ Mystic currents”—that when taken together, form a loose mosaic-like picture. Over the last two years, his music has grown steadily darker: 2022’s  , a collaboration with noface released by the experimental label   channeled the same sense of dread as the horror movies Sharif loves. (Sharif is a cinephile in general; to read any interview is to end up adding five or ten titles to your Letterboxed Watchlist.) On that release, noface’s production sounded like it was perennially creeping up behind Sharif, ghostly and chilling; the rapper’s bars, clipped and list-like, functioned less as rhymes than as demonic incantations (“Past dreams where I’m last seen/ Held vaccine/ Cronenberg’s last scene/ War world   got  y award.”) Sharif’s plunge into darkness continues on  , his latest—and arguably strongest—record, and his first for billy woods’s  . This time with   manning the boards, Sharif conjures nightmare after nightmare, all of them delivered one quick glimpse at a time—like you’re catching sight of terrifying figures from the window of a speeding train at night. Sharif has always had chemistry with his producers, but the symbiosis between him and Dove has brought out the best in both of them. On “East Hollywood,” Dove’s production is all dripping pipes, creaking floorboards, and grim piano, and Sharif matches the mood from the jump: “Cloned reptilians murder at 1600/ …Sunrise thesis/ The apartheid seamstress/ Hawkeye, float over sky, fungi fetus.” Throughout, Sharif uses his voice as another instrument in the canvas, plunging it down to the deepest reaches of his register, or doubling and tripling it so there’s one Sharif delivering the lines in rumbling low tones while others wail out the same words in a panicked tone above. This produces a deeply disconcerting effect on “Dimethyltryptamine.” Dove’s production is barely there at all, just a sluggish beat and some groaning industrial tones as the two Sharifs—one composed and determined, the other utterly freaked out—glide hauntingly through the empty air. To try to make literal sense of   is to miss the point. Sharif is trying to give you the   of something, not spell everything out in plain English. This approach is crucial: to quote Bob Dylan, you know something’s happening, but you don’t know what it is—and that nonspecific dread compounds exponentially as the record progresses.   is a horror film where the monster is forever waiting right around the next corner.

This penchant for melody is one of the album’s most distinctive traits, as choruses and vocal fragments repeat and build upon each other to hypnotic effect. Opener “123” starts with a polyphonic lament set against pounding drums and dramatic build-ups that evolve into infectious hooks. “Geneya” takes the Arabic folk trope of the wish-granting genie as inspiration to tell a story of unrequited love. Almaazz’s voice is high-octane, reaching a level of intensity that evokes both pain and desire. “Ah” is the only track that somewhat deviates from the formula, taking a more sparse approach to showcase her vocals in a larger-than-life, cinematic setting against dissonant, haunting elements and dancefloor signifiers. Her songs have a rather simple structure, with a playful spontaneity that lend them a delightful rawness. In the same interview, Almaazz likens her songwriting to a diary, merging short melodies together in an organic manner. There’s a cathartic, stream-of-consciousness quality to the way she switches between verses and iterations, with enough variation to keep things exciting. She also   singing in her native language as a vital part of discovering her voice, which contributes to the album’s authentic feel.

{"album": "Journey to the Moon and Beyond", "artist": "Mort Garson", "description": "Diving into ambient for the first time can be daunting. So many of the genre’s influential albums require patience and concentration. Even household names, like   and  , have a tendency to make sonic art that is more challenging than it is approachable. For those looking to dip their toes into ambient waters for the first time,  ’s Moog-y work offers a perfect starting point. The late Canadian session musician-turned-modular synth innovator’s knack for verdant composition is far removed from the genre’s austere stereotypes. Garson spent his life putting out music in relative obscurity, amassing a varied discography of recorded work that largely fell on unknowing ears. It wasn’t until the late 2010s, when a bootleg of his resplendent 1976 record   blew up on YouTube, that Garson finally located the attentive audience he deserved. After so many years of nonrecognition, that album earned a   from   which helped appraise Garson as an unsung legend of forward-thinking synthesis.  a new archival release from that same Brooklyn label—is a collection of pieces Garson wrote for film, television, and advertisements. It highlights a navy-tinted side of his sound—similar to the one explored on 1971’s sinister   but less fixated on the macabre. Here, the unshakable chipperness that helped make   a beloved cult favorite has been swapped for an essence of cartoonish esoterica. It’s fitting that the rushing, carnivalesque “Moon Journey” was composed for  . But, in spite of its backstory, that cut is hardly the most celestial on the album. “Captain DJ Disco UFO (Pt II)’” is particularly trippy, centered on whirring arpeggiations and growly vocals about watching a spaceship spin.

And the whirring “Three TV IDs” could practically pass for an outtake from a record on a contemporary left-field imprint like   or  . Even the most overtly commercial compositions here—the various “Music For Advertising” installments—pack a gnarled, otherworldly punch. From front to back, the whole album is cast in an exuberant, wacky glow, the same one that might fall upon a psychedelic watering hole from a Thomas Pynchon novel. Closer “Black Eye (End Credits)” basks in suave darkness, carried by smoky vocals and a loungey groove. It ends the record on a surprisingly earthly note that feels more suited for looking up at the constellations above than hovering among them. However, most of the tones on   seem to frolic in the far-flung outer reaches of the cosmos. It serves as a reminder that, even at its most alien, Garson’s art thrums with lively warmth.   presents a curious take on his boisterous spirit, cultivating an aural realm that is surrealistically over-the-top in the most endearing way.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

Only their third release,  is the debut from Cairo painter and producer Fajr Soliman (aka El Kontessa).

What distinguishes Soliman from contemporaries like   and  , however, is her maximalist style. Like her wildly colorful visual artwork, some of which adorns the album’s cover, she packs as many ideas into each track as she can, never quite sticking to one groove, texture, tempo, or melody. Yet it’s not at the expense of danceability, informed as much by electronic experimentation as by tried-and-true rhythms from Jersey club to  . One only needs to listen to “Ghaltet Meen غلطة مين” (Who is to blame?) to understand Soliman’s M.O. here. Sampling a famous political     by Shafiqa شفيقة, Soliman throws its key elements—string flourishes, aching vocals, and a driving   rhythm—into a blender, reconstructing it as an electronic anthem. Coming in like a truck with a heavy kick and dubstep-esque bass weight at about 120 BPM, flighty strings signal for the first BPM change of many, bumping things up to 160 as a sparse, oddball beat shapeshifts alongside vocal irruptions and darbuka rolls.

Things slow down again, low synths droning on alongside a flurry of samples; when it’s time for the finale, Soliman kicks it back up with bursts of kicks and tambourine structured around a central dembow (if you tilt your ears another way, you might hear   or  as well). It’s a hell of a track, and every listen reveals new sonic epiphanies. Other tracks here are just as inventive. “Bingo” opens with a blend between Jersey kicks and  , before introducing a series of ominous sawtooth and metallophone synths. “Mesh Marshmallow” is all aquatic immersion, the syncopated synth line weaving in and out of a maqsoum rhythm; later, the beat gets front-loaded, with sub-heavy kicks taking the lead alongside warbling synth. And just when you think she’s decided to end things slowly with a hip-hop flip of the   (1970)  , Soliman suddenly goes double time with a breakcore breakdown in closing track “Asanser.” Packing all of this into an under-30 minute total runtime,   نص ح​ب​ة ك​ر​ا​م​ي​ل is a whirlwind of a debut.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

In New Orleans, Africans were allowed to retain the complex musical traditions they brought over the Atlantic and inject an African sound into an American musical and social context. Adjuah’s new album  gives us a glimpse of what a free, forward-looking Black musical form can be. With his voice and a self-designed electric bow/harp at the forefront, the music on  is deeply rooted in African tradition and unfettered by the constraints of any Western concept of genre. The hypnotic opener “Blood Calls Blood” is followed by “Trouble That Mornin’,” a tune where propulsive hand drumming anchors soaring vocals. Here, the song’s lyrics remind listeners that it has been 500 years since the onset of colonialism and the slave trade while evoking the names of the Yoruba   Shango and Yemaya. “On To New Orleans (Runnin’ in 7s Redux)” strips things down to the core with a complex mixture of percussion elements that display African drumming in all its orchestral glory. A powerful melding of West African and Black American sensibilities,  speaks to the multitudinous nature of our diaspora.

The music is generally high energy, packed with multilayered instrumentation and vocal tracks. It sounds like Silicone Prairie sole proprietor Ian Teeple (you may know him from   or  ), accompanied by friends from the Kansas City, Missouri punk/indie rock scene, is having a ton of fun playing these tunes. They’re less zany punk than on previous efforts and more expansive, with a wide-ranging experimental palette calling to mind free jazz-leaning  , the garage-prog-pop of  , and fellow Midwesterners  . Opener “Serpent in the Grass” makes good use of the band’s standard lo-fi production style, toggling between psychedelic glam and boisterous proto-punk. Noodly guitars and squiggly synths conjure visions of   antics. Teeple’s vocals at times resemble  ’s Mark E. Smith, at times Dead Kennedys’s  . But the band’s main point of reference seems to be swirling ’70s folk, from the hazy “Victorian Flame” to the guitar-forward “Painting Trains.” Tucked inside   are vignettes that feel almost out of place, or engineered to interrupt the flow. There’s “Willkommen,” an ambient interlude with AI-like German spoken word—that voice circles back to end the album as well. There’s 20 seconds of dissonant warbling at the end of “Cows.” There’s the wavy synth of “Freed’s Wet Tape.” Or perhaps those juxtapositions of sound instead help establish the heterogeneity of the record—one where flute solos coexist with skronky kazoo sounds and lyrics about hating the U.S. (The smooth “Neon Moon” sounds like   singing a bizarro version of   theme song.) While this record fits well into the   roster, it wouldn’t be out of place among the dreamy twee acts on   or the broadly experimental DIY artists on  . Which brings us back to “Cows,” a folky song packed with a string of references to ranch life and existentialism.

It brings something more modern that die-hard fans can grow with.  starts with “Bird on a Wire,” maybe my favorite of the three singles with its spacey, dubby guitar riffs fragmenting over taught mid-tempo backbeat and dialed basslines. The vocals are front and center with a sweet but raw cadence. This song feels akin to the group’s early sounds. The second single, “Thing I Put Together,” has more of a sludgy, dirge-y 90’s thing happening with personal lyrics, almost like it’s Bush Tetras’s take on an Alice In Chains or Hole song. Title track “They Live in My Head” starts with an off-kilter twangy acoustic guitar and is soon accompanied by a full band, building into the sped-up chorus which is honestly catchy as hell. This one feels like a mad mix of a   song and a Jim Carroll Band tune, an homage to classic punk. The tempo is a little bipolar, but it fits the song. The rest of the album follows suit, a mixed bag of styles and sounds, as if the band members are simultaneously relearning and reinventing who they are together as Bush Tetras. Ultimately,   has glimpses of the Bush Tetras of the past, but it’s not that. It is, however, a new piece of history—a component of a body of work, a new layer exposed by time’s stalwart waves.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"]}

That includes the cover, with its bygone paparazzi-style snap of the trio emerging from a basement club, drinks still in hand. It’s vintage down to the film grain and the hip-hugging plaid flares. Besides these frequent gestures to Chic and Sylvester, more contemporary influences seep into  well. There are HAIM-style harmonies on “Easy” and “Hold Tight,” plus enough burning synthpop desire on “Up” that it wouldn’t feel out of place in ’s catalog. “Everybody’s Saying That” approaches -levels of Casio sleaze, as does the vocoder-drenched album closer “Give Me Your Love.” The combined effect propels them into   and   territory; this is music for sashaying together in St. Tropez, as opposed to making out in the bathroom at Berghain or behind the South London warehouse at an illegal rave.

The music ventures from buoyant meditations to frenetic explorations across  ’s nine tracks, following the ups and downs of each artist’s shapeshifting solos. Each piece emphasizes the group’s unity and trust in each other—the artists let their sound grow through communication, adapting to each other’s motions. On opener “Sitting with it,” Lim plays a lush, ascending violin melody while Vandever slips her trombone in between; each melody fades into a bed of pillowy resonance. On “Taste & Touch,” the group picks up the pace, layering blistering trills and scratchy tremolos between Vandever’s rich trombone playing. Elsewhere, solo tracks take the music in new directions. “Passing By” features gentle, wafting reveries reminiscent of Vandever’s  , while “Quick Flight,” a short interlude, puts a spotlight on Colón’s fleeting saxophone riffs. Throughout, Lim’s violin navigates the music through its twists and turns.   highlights her capability in a variety of styles: “Drawing Out,” the eeriest track on the record, builds around squealing, fast-paced passages that jump from string to string. Elsewhere, her playing takes on a softer and sweeter tone, acting as the glue that holds the sprawling music together, like on “As It All Goes By.” Here, her violin takes a back seat to a soaring saxophone and trombone duet, but her looping, bright melody imbues the track with hope and vibrancy.   is, at its heart, a testament to her agility on the violin and a powerful statement that shows her willingness to explore her instrument. In the process, Lim celebrates her own voice—derived from the classical tradition and borne through deep connections.", "genre": ["Classical", "contemporary classical"]}

Couched by hyperactive drums and a deluge of guitars, Bognanno plunges into the beauty and the terror of her life and, goodness, the human condition at large. Or as she puts it on “A Wonderful Life”: “What a wonderful life/ My heart’s breakin’ on the bathroom floor.” She seems newly and keenly aware that life is shorter than it seems and that there’s never enough time with the people you love, conveyed as much lyrically as it is through the furious urgency of her playing. On “Lose You”: “Time is just a useless measurement of pain.” Somewhere down the line, she realized that the only constant is change, and she has, in her way, embraced that.

Produced by James Trevascus ( ,  ), Worms was recorded with the crackling airwaves of radio in mind, packing in mammoth, Springsteen-ian riffs and punchy drum fills into airtight melodies.

Now the two tighten the spotlight, zeroing in on one of that period’s salsa giants, capturing the maestro’s high water mark as he achieved the dream of leading his own band. The life of Venezuelan bandleader   is a testament to counting your blessings and biding your time. His early rise is due in no small part to his chameleonic vocal abilities—his skill in channeling legendary Puerto Rican singer and songwriter   landed him in front of the microphone for , his first band. He spent a decade as the outfit’s powerhouse vocalist, flexing his now-vast musical vocabulary and technical prowess on songs like the smoky, hypnotic “ .” As his fame grew, so did his ambition, and after filing his resignation with Juventud, Quintana launched his own sextet, Tabaco y sus Metales, kicking off a second decade of devotion to the heavy-hitting, roots-oriented salsa that first drew him to music in his youth. From the first notes of “El Tren de Porky” to the compilation’s closing salvo “Casamiento,” Tabaco punches deep into the rhythms, punctuating the band’s unimaginably deep pocket with a smoky, haunting voice that leaves behind the theatrical mimicry of his youth for a more mature, jazzy flow, gliding across the beat with time-tested fluidity. It’s most clearly felt on the roiling “Arollando,” where Quintana tumbles out of the band’s opening vamp to play a dazzling call-and-response with himself in every register, crooning and teasing, before letting out a shriek that sets the band soaring. “La Libertad” is entrancing, a well-oiled machine of criss-crossing melodic snippets that build to a dramatic flood of rhythm. The sauntering “Imolle” indulges in a flair for the cinematic, riding luxurious spirals of horns that punch well above their weight in brass as Tabaco crosses into the ‘80s with a sextet that hits as hard as an orchestra. When Quintana passed away at the all-too-young age of 51 in the mid-‘90s, his death was met with a national outpouring of grief as thousands swept into the streets, mourning a hero whose eloquence extended far beyond the borders of the stage. At the height of his fame, Tabaco was known for performing in prisons, and his sensitivity to the egregious injustices of his day power two of the compilation’s strongest works, “Una Sola Bandera” and “Cuando Llora el Indio”—both of them forceful, insightful denunciations of racial ills that demand to be heard alongside his “softer” populist material.

The draw of Pantayo, however, is that they seem to be able to do it all. On their latest album  , Pantayo make quantum leaps from neo-soul to minimal techno to drone, with the metallic microtones of kulintang providing the center for their musical orbit. Related to other Southeast Asian gong-chime cultures including Indonesian gamelan and Thai piphat, kulintang is a music indigenous to the southern Philippines (specifically the Maguindanaon and T’boli peoples).

{"album": "Guy", "artist": "Jayda G", "description": " (born Jayda Guy)’s new album  shows an artist fully at home with expressing herself. It’s more than her most personal record to date, it’s formed from snippets of her life. Archival recordings of her father blend seamlessly into the fabric of her house and disco-charged production. While Guy’s 2019 debut   drew on her research as an environmental toxicologist, her second full-length leads more on human-forward themes: finding your place in the world against the odds, using your voice, and searching for community. The album’s pop-ready structures, carved out under the influence of UK producer and musician   and songwriter and producer Ed Thomas, bring heavy-hearted personal histories and songwriting to life. Guy’s father’s presence steers the album’s narrative from the “Intro”; listeners hear the heart-wrenching news of his cancer diagnosis as he lays out the recordings. On “Blue Lights,” over a magnetic backdrop of groovy electronica, Guy recounts the life-changing time he wound up at the 1968 Chicago riots. She penned the track around the time of the global Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. “I wanted the album to be a blend of storytelling, about the African-American experience, death, grief, and understanding,” she writes in a press release. “This album is just so much for people who have been oppressed and who have not had easy lives.” The soulful pulse of “Scars” may run counter to its hard-to-swallow tale about her father’s harrowing experience, but it also serves to heighten the impact of the “rage,” “burning,” and “exploding” images that populate the track. Similarly, the tripped-out downtempo of “Lonely Back in O” only makes the sense of desolation feel more pronounced. Meanwhile, “Circle Back Around” creates repetition, space, and continuity in the vocal effects and drum patterns that pleasantly mirror the track’s central conceit: “What goes round circles back around / I’ve been running, running so long.” Propelled by a string of positive affirmations,  also reads like a manual for living life on your own terms. “Been encouraged to be naughty / I am naughty, and still holy,” she sings on blissful album standout “Sapphires of Gold,” where ‘90s, delay-drenched synths back her dreamy and euphoric voice. However, it’s the soaring vocal refrain that ties everything together: “I have fallen in love with living,” she sings, reminding listeners that   is ultimately an album grounded in finding your place in the world and a masterstroke of storytelling for the dancefloor.", "genre": []}

The Australian band, who formed in 1979, encompassed the steadfast purity of early post-punk that emphasized zero frills and even fewer complications. However, much like the provocative tongue-in-cheek hijinks by   and fellow Aussies  , pel mel were complex in their layered nuances of snide hooks and smart song structures, originally carving out their aesthetic as a bar band in Newcastle. There, they performed original songs alongside covers of Wire,  , and Joy Division—all before relocating to the burgeoning underground music scene in Sydney. By the early ’80s, with two LPs and a slew of successful singles under their belt (they were the only Australian band signed by s licensee, GAP Records), pel mel had forged a distinctive identity around contrast, more specifically the interplay between Judy McGee’s airy vocal melodies and the quirky, gnarled guitar lines surrounding them. Technically, McGee isn’t the band’s only singer (guitarist Graeme Dunne occasionally provides backup), but she’s got a singular voice nevertheless—and, given the heavily skewed gender divide that defined post-punk at that time, a historic one as well.  , which collects pel mel’s final recorded tracks, solidifies that legacy from the opposite end of the timeline: the last hurrah from a group who elbowed their way to a major label record deal without compromising once. The   hints towards what pel mel would have sounded like had they not disbanded in 1985—a heavily synthesized sound in contrast to the band’s previous discography that boasted saxophone solos as much as electronic instruments. “Love on a Funeral Pyre” scales down the band to an iteration that includes an FM synth, guitar, bass, and a LinnDrum drum machine. The lo-fi groove of “Shipwrecked” thrives on its inherent sunshine-y simplicity, while “Fool’s House” toes the line of pop music with jangly guitars as McGee, in a melancholic gusto, sings: “I just can’t seem to change my tune / Though it hurts to play the fool.” As the most danceable, disco-laden track, “Mr. President” is influenced by the gritty New York City CBGB crew, namely the Talking Heads, with a funky bassline and deconstructed dance hooks that are punctuated by cymbal crashes. Through the hum of the recording quality and the synthesizer’s fragile melodies, each song teems in in an exposed vulnerability, especially found in the effortlessly enchanting trot of the title track and the breeziness of “Calamity Jane” that harkens to the warm beaches of their hometown. But, simultaneously, there’s wear and tear over these moments. It’s clear these recordings are vestiges of a band who’ve always done things on their own terms.   is far from pel mel’s early pub gigs—it represents a band, with their hewn and planished edges, whose time might’ve ended too soon.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Isolation and limited infrastructure might go some way in explaining why someone making music as mind-blowing as Jantra has toiled in relative obscurity until now. He’s hailed as a hero within his own community but unknown even in broader Sudan. In his hometown of Gedarif, Jantra is known as the man behind the raucous “Jaglara” music, translated as “craziness,” the local sound which animates celebrations and gatherings for hours on end. All Jantra needs to whip up listeners into a frenzy is his trusty Yamaha keyboard, which has been modified by the “keyboard mechanics” of Khartoum market to reflect the tone of Sudanese music. Rather than playing concerts in a traditional sense he freestyles his melodies, live-producing his music based on his audience’s reaction. His approach is raw and minimal, but with only a handful of elements he is able to weave bombastic and endlessly transportive tunes that swirl around and around in a feat of true audio hypnotism. But when the team behind  —who have a track record of uncovering obscure sounds from the Horn of Africa, and most recently released the incredible  by Noori & His Dorpa Band from the Port of Sudan—started working on a record of Jantra’s music, his improvisational flair presented a dilemma.

Not only has sampling revived interest in old records, but it has also inspired contemporary musicians and listeners to carefully study how those records were made. The conceptual and technical leap required to snatch bits of recorded audio and use them as building blocks for new compositions has opened a Pandora’s box of sorts. Today, instrumentalists play with a samplist’s ear to connect the past with the present. The latest from producer Abderraouf B Grissa and producer/drummer   embodies the shift that sampling has ushered into modern music. Throughout   the duo’s groovy, texturally rich instrumentals combine jazz, hip-hop, dub, and experimental electronics in a way that could only happen in a post-sampling world. Throughout each of the album’s tracks, genre is traversed liberally and influences—both contemporary and historical—are twisted into something new and strange. The album’s opener, “Any Time, Man,” is a bass-heavy tune with thick drums and an odd vocal sample of a man promising to provide us with “the basics” needed for survival. Jarret Gilgore’s bright alto saxophone licks recede into the background almost as suddenly as they appear, and the tune’s dark, heady vibe would fit in perfectly next to the work of ‘90s beat experimentalist Spectre and his Wordsound label. “Theme” is a slick, head-nodding, jazz-funk tune with some lovely sax and electric piano. A series of ghostly vocal samples and a whistled melody act as a hook; Drohan’s drumming is tight and propulsive. “Lake Poe” is a dreamy tune where sax and acoustic guitar are processed through a delay effect to produce an oceanic wave of sound. Drohan’s drumming is jagged and irregular, in counterpoint to the looping, hypnotic groove created by the melodic instruments. With tracks like the booming hip-hop track “Paris 1958” and the blissful nine-minute epic “Kalimbient,”  is as adventurous as it is tasteful.

It’s an absolute shame that Eastman’s radical art, which unapologetically centered his identity in ways rarely seen in the avant-garde classical world, languished for decades before the scribes of history finally deemed it foundational—but his career contained multitudes that have still not been fully explored. With Wild Up’s   of their anthology series showcasing the work of Julius Eastman, the Los Angeles ensemble strikes a tone of celebration rather than lament as they shine their spotlight in new corners of the composer’s vast repertoire. For their  , Wild Up focused on Eastman’s signature piece  , casting off a strong opening salvo by jamming their version with more kinetic energy than any other ensemble’s attempt.  , they turned their attention to underrepresented items in the catalog, addressing the uncertainty of scores that don’t have canonical readings by providing multiple versions. Now, in  , one of Eastman’s extant works appears for the first time in recorded form—  (1970), a vocal work composed to accompany a ballet.   is a multimedia epic, capturing the full extent of Eastman’s fascinations in a single sweep; it’s an opera, a dance, and an improvisational sound collage. Though the visual aspects of the work can’t be expressed in the recording, the drama is no less present. Musicians stomp and clap like thespians on a stage. A chorus of voices rise, haunting chants phase in and out, and foreboding strings billow underneath. Wild Up tackles more familiar pieces, too, infusing new life into the work with their own arrangements.   (1977) ups the unrelenting energy of Eastman’s own recording from the   compilation, combining stabs of brass with piercing shrieks and extended vocal techniques not present in the original score. Even more impressive is a stunning new rendition of   (1979), led by Devonté Hynes (aka  ) and Adam Tendler on dueling pianos.   is percussive and propulsive, demanding high physical stamina to play for a full 20 minutes. Here, the stress is doubled as the usual four lead instruments are cut down to two. However, the biggest curveball is the addition of a full chamber orchestra, instructed to improvise in response to the pianists. The normally rote, hypnotic piece is transformed into an evolving organism. Eastman’s sudden departure left us with a scattered body of work, few recordings, and no directives for what to do with it all. As historians, musicians, and listeners alike pick through what’s left, it’s up to each individual to take a principled stance on what his legacy means. On  , Wild Up chose to fill those gaps in the record with their own joyful noise.", "genre": []}
{"album": "MICHAEL", "artist": "Killer Mike", "description": "Killer Mike’s trajectory feels like the mythical American bootstraps story. He was born to a teen mom in the west Atlanta neighborhood of Adamsville, attended Frederick Douglass High School and Morehouse College, but eventually dropped out to become a drug dealer. He’d work on music on the side, using dope money to pay for recording equipment. Eventually, Big Boi of Outkast gave him a shot, inviting him to appear on their late career single, “The Whole World.” That song would go on to win a Grammy. Mike then partnered with T.I., releasing a string of well-received mixtapes with Grand Hustle, though none quite broke through to the mainstream. A friend at Adult Swim paired Mike with Def Jux rapper and producer El-P for what was supposed to be a couple of songs, but they got on so well the sessions turned into a full album, 2012’s  . That partnership became Run The Jewels, an indomitable, festival-headlining, arena-packing project that’s taken El-P and Mike to new heights of critical success and fame. Along the way, the 48-year-old rapper has become something of a polarizing figure. He’s never been shy about his politics, which don’t fit neatly into a particular category. Mike campaigned for Bernie Sanders in 2016 but has taken meetings with and spoken warmly of Georgia’s deeply conservative governor, Brian Kemp. His activism feels particularly focused on capitalism as a path to freedom, confusing some supporters who otherwise identify with his message of liberation. It’s a bit messy. , Killer Mike’s first solo album in over a decade, embraces and investigates that messiness. It’s a highly personal record; part origin story, part therapy session, and part love letter to his hometown. Across  ’s 54 intense minutes, Mike presents a complex portrait of himself, not shying away from anger, but trying to temper it with the wisdom that comes from living nearly half a century. He expresses conflicted feelings about abortion on “Slummer,” but recognizes that it was the best decision for him and his high-school girlfriend. The song is both warm and wistful but doesn’t display acrimony to anyone involved. Though he titles a song about the wreckage of addiction the somewhat insensitive “Something for Junkies,” he casts an empathetic eye on those who deal with the disease. Mike’s honesty is brutal, but it’s very human. The album isn’t all raw emotion, though. There are plenty of celebratory moments, like the Dungeon Family reunion of “Scientists & Engineers,” which features incredible performances from Andre 3000 and Future. Curren$y and 2 Chainz show up to flex on “Spaceship Views,” and the playful “Don’t Let The Devil” serves as a reminder of the chemistry that makes Run The Jewels so magnetic.   also   amazing; Mike reportedly spent nearly $500,000 on the album, and the pristine mixing and lush instrumentation are a joy to get lost in. Mike’s no stranger to making enormous music, but executive producer No ID helps guide it towards billowing Southern gospel rather than RTJ’s confrontational bombast. Mike describes the album as a “testimonial in church,” an acknowledgment that pain and struggle can lead us to ugly places. But more than anything,   is an acceptance of being a perpetual work in progress. The longer you live, the more you understand that your foibles are part of your character. You can grow, change, and reflect, but hopefully, you can get to a place where you feel you’re enough.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}
{"album": "Tao Fire 道火", "artist": "Mong Tong 夢東", "description": "Taoism originated in Chinese antiquity and spread across East and Southeast Asia over subsequent millennia, meshing with regional folk rituals, animistic beliefs, and artistic traditions. This type of cultural diffusion informs the aesthetic contours of Taiwanese duo  , whose latest,   continues a syncretic project of merging psychedelia and ambient electronics with a local, if mobile, set of referents from pan-Asian myth and folk tradition. After a riff-heavy invocation on opening track “Mystery Death,”  picks up Mong Tong’s median sound: patient yet exploratory, effervescent, and elegantly structured. It coheres like a film soundtrack, consistent with the band’s  : a careful assemblage of music, design, and a crypto-Taoist dress code of stark black and white and red. The throughlines of   are rudimentary percussion, ritual repetition, and an affinity for the timbres and tempos of Southeast Asian folk music. It weaves thudding gamelan rhythms, percussively strummed   (a Thai/Lao lute), and street-level field recordings into otherwise mostly guitar- and synth-based compositions, to mesmeric effect. One of the most energetic and representative tracks is “Areca,” where a bright guitar trills quick triplets over a cutting synth stab before making way for a syncopated, constantly panning frame drum beat. A groggy melody takes the lead, eventually giving way to gamelan bells and vintage psych guitar flourishes. Many of the sonic elements across   have an underwater feel; key lead melodies or ambiguous vocal anchors, like the reverb-misted incantations on “Gold Earth,” are buried in the mix. Plastic, Casio-esque tones add a compelling retro touch to the sonic palette, as on “Mountain Pond,” where a fuzzy keyboard pounds out a layer of grit that balances the tranquil flute and clean pads that open the track. The cumulative result is enchantment, that out-of-time feeling engendered by the best psychedelic music. If there’s one moment when the spell is broken, it’s on penultimate track “Ghost Island.” Extensively sampling recordings of Hanoi Hannah—a North Vietnam radio personality  —“Ghost Island” counters Mong Tong’s sonic cocoon with grim exhortations: “G.I., your government has betrayed you…Your rich leaders grow richer while you die in the swamp, G.I.” The contrast is jarring, evoking a past proxy battle between imperialist powers to subtly hint at potential future conflict. But to assess   through the frame of geopolitics would be foolish. Lexical ambiguity is baked into the project: Mong Tong’s name is a derivation of their childhood nicknames, signifying different things in Chinese, Cantonese, and Burmese. Fittingly, the album ends with an inchoate chorus of voices frothing together like sea foam on “Rain Maker,” fading out for a full minute of silence before a brief coda ends the journey as cryptically as it began. is Mong Tong’s latest ticket to a sonic space that’s familiar yet otherworldly, a half-dreamt subtropical archipelago one senses they’re only beginning to map.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "Death’s Toll", "artist": "DeathCollector", "description": "Old-school death metal had a huge moment at the end of the 2010s. Records that paid homage to early ’90s greats were in abundance, which fit the zeitgeist: Culture-war battles that had cooled raged once more; grunge-inspired fashions returned; blast beats, growls, and grimy guitars were  , baby. That initial boom spawned a broader revisiting of classic styles of extreme music. But even as the OSDM craze gives way to more subtlety and depth, some sounds remain evergreen. “Bolt Thrower” continues to trend on Twitter every so often, as old heads rediscover the classics and new fans spin records like   for the first time. The UK’s  , anchored by   alumnus Andrew Whale on drums, marries these old-school sensibilities with contemporary pugilism, and their inaugural full-length,  , contains the best of both worlds. Production plays a major role here. While today’s death metal tends to lean toward either self-conscious retro scuzz or an ultra-refined sheen,  opts for a “raw and unbridled” style without feeling like a self-conscious tribute to times gone by. Recorded in multiple countries,  still feels alive and immediate. It’s of a piece with the accidentally-on-purpose balanced production of many early death metal milestones. The songwriting also walks the line between familiar and fresh, aided by shapeshifting riffs from Mick Carey (also of Ireland’s  ). “Coarse Visions,” one of the album’s highlights, fades in with springy bass and thundering drums before Carey’s guitar boils over. “A Taste of Ichor” is another meaty helping of riffs that features some midtempo doom sections. Both clock in at around four minutes—not too short; not too long. These newer tracks build on what the band explored on their inaugural three-track EP,  . All three of those songs appear on  ; however, the restraint of Gord Olson’s production on the latter makes what had already been structurally sound compositions sound like classics by comparison. These digital recordings sound warmer, and put the churning guitar, Kieran Scott of  ‘s forceful vocals, and of course, the massive rhythm section, on an equal footing. The result is 38 minutes of timeless death metal.", "genre": ["Metal"]}

On her latest record,  , Sánchezcontinues this hybrid medium approach with songs that explore her inner world with lush synths and angelic vocals. “Ver A Través de tus Ojos,” a collaboration with cellist Mabe Fratti, is a strong opener. Fratti’s strings perfectly complement del Sánchez’s heartfelt vocals. Glittering sound effects descend as the song fades, seamlessly transitioning into “Tangible.” With its danceable beat and noisy backdrop that evokes a glitchy radio, “Tangible” allows Sanchez’s voice to cover a wider expressive range.

{"album": "Death Folk Country", "artist": "Dorthia Cottrell", "description": "In 2013, the Richmond, Virginia doom metal group   released its breakthrough album  , which earned attention far and wide thanks to the band’s chest-cavingly crunchy guitar riffs and singer Dorthia Cottrell’s otherworldly wail. Just a year and a half later, Cottrell pulled off a serious stylistic zigzag when she put out a   of quiet country-folk songs that showcased her versatility while retaining the dusky intensity of her full-band work. “I guess when I’m older I will understand,” she sings on the twangy “Perennial,”  ’s penultimate track. “The passing of time is just a sleight of hand.” Speaking of time, eight years have passed since then, during which Windhand has released not   but   excellent albums of world-class doom. And now, Cottrell is back with her second solo set, appropriately titled  , which she explains thusly: “The title […] is partly me describing a genre that fits the sound, but it’s also meant to be taken as a naming, a coronation of the world inside me.” That world is stranger, noisier, and even creepier than it was in 2015. Where the debut featured stark presentations of mostly guitar and voice,  ’s 11 tracks live in a world decorated with mournful strings and chimes, murky tones and echo, field recordings, ghostly vocal harmonies, Southern Gothic vibes, and an inescapable disquiet that belies the ease with which Cottrell unfurls her reflections on life, lust, love, and loss.  is bookended by “Death is the Punishment for Love” and “Death is Reward for Love,” two short instrumental pieces that feel like portals into and out of the album. In between, Cottrell hauntingly—and patiently!—paints a picture of black canyons, burning bodies, untimely graves, lonely souls, and lessons learned from a life lived in the narrow space between heaven and hell. At the center of the album is a four-song stretch that explores the corners of death folk country: “Family Annihilator,” an infernal nursery rhyme-like chant with a droning backbone; “Effigy at the Gate of Ur,” a beautifully heartbroken hymn; “Midnight Boy,” a sinful tale built on grunge-y blues; and the seething “Hell in My Water,” which is about as country as Cottrell gets here. “When I am sober, I’m mean,” she sings against austere accompaniment. “God must’ve come down, put hell in my water/ ‘cause I follow my sorrow upstream.” The album’s final proper song is “Eat What You Kill,” which finds Cottrell singing along to a simple acoustic guitar strum: “I’ve been thinking, I’m better off dead/ Does not matter what I do or I said/ Ain’t no glory in a life lived too long/ Ain’t nothin’ special about singin’ a song.” That last line encapsulates  ’s greatest asset: expertly treading the blurry lines between light and dark; good and evil; life and death.", "genre": ["Folk"]}
{"album": "I Came From Love", "artist": "Dave Okumu & The 7 Generations", "description": "On  , Dave Okumu & The 7 Generations expose the horrors of chattel slavery and the generations of trauma that have followed in its wake. The album opens with “Things,” a brief but harrowing piece featuring Grace Jones that includes a quote from a slave owner named  , who advised future slave owners to “buy land and buy young slaves.” That quote sets the emotional tone for the album. With enslaved Africans legally conscripted to a lifetime of bondage, the practice of purchasing young children ensured owners a maximum return on their investment. Faced with the barbarity and hopelessness in the face of this cruelest of social institutions, perseverance became a key component of our collective culture. The song “7 Generations” tells the story of Black perseverance over a deep, reggae-style bassline and dramatic organ. Here, Okumu reminds Black people that we will survive despite having been torn from our ancestral lands and stripped of our language, identities, and culture. “Blood Ah Go Run” ups the tempo, with minimal, post-punk-style drums, bass, and synth. A protest tune at heart, the chant that acts as the song’s hook offers a promise to the oppressors and enslavers of the world: “Blood ah go run if no justice no come.” “Streets” summons a bleak, gloomy tone with its half-sung and half-spoken vocal delivery and disjointed beats. “My Negritude” is built around a busy Afrobeat and an excerpt from  ’s 1939 poem   Written as a critique of European colonialism and hegemony, Cesaire’s words animate the track, daring listeners to take a critical look at the brutal oppression that colonialism exported around the globe. The album closes with “Paradise,” featuring another appearance by Grace Jones.

When you’re younger, the distant horizon feels like a symbol of the infinite possibilities before you. But once you’ve crossed 30, there comes a point when it suddenly clicks: The horizon is actually a hard stop, and you’ve been moving towards it at a rapid clip. , South Side Chicago’s gravel-voiced truth-teller, raps about this existential reckoning with a relatable mix of apprehension and acceptance. His last full-length,   a collaboration with producer  , was an immersive rumination on death and how to process the grim knowledge that it will happen to you and everyone you know. His newest record,  , made in tandem with   labelmate and producer Custom Made, takes a more zen approach. Solar isn’t stuck in the depths here; instead, he’s acknowledging the inevitable while learning to be more grounded in the present. The reflective nature of   isn’t surprising: even in his grittiest moments, SolarFive’s always been a contemplative rapper, adept at connecting profound, cosmic truths with the harsh reality—and surprising beauty—of everyday life. He makes space for fear and uncertainty on “Vibrations,” recognizing that “it’s hard to walk the unknown path, especially with all the splits that one road has.” Though it’s difficult to push through, eventually you may feel gratitude for the journey. The second verse of “Brand Nubian” is the perfect distillation of his skills: “Nights turn to days, gunpowder mixed with morning dew/ Only thing that come with age is more to do/ Realizing life is more than you, six feet with a gorgeous view.” A current of sincerity flows through the album, but Solar never gets preachy. Instead, he offers a hard-bitten hope, the kind that comes from a lifetime of trudging through mud and miraculously never getting stuck. While Solar tackles heavy concepts—the pressures and fears of being a parent in America, the paranoia inherent to the drug trade, the death of a loved one—Custom Made’s production helps keep the mood surprisingly light. His beats are bright and airy, foregrounding drums while setting colorful samples and live instrumentation loose to waft together like clouds at sunset. Each song has gorgeous touches: Synth chord accents gracefully bloom on “Brand Nubian;” a soulful organ snakes through the verses on “30 For 30;” diaphanous keyboards set “In The Wind” fully adrift. The songs feel natural and lived-in, as if we’re listening to Solar and Custom create them in real-time. Custom knows when to pull back, subtly directing attention to particularly poignant lyrical passages. In clammier hands,   would come off as a crisis record. It’s an album that examines a distinct rudderless feeling of being a confused grown-up, a concept that seems both timeless and surprisingly absent from the greater conversation. But SolarFive and Custom Made address these ideas with grace and humility. Together, they’ve made an eminently listenable record about the perplexing space between being old enough to know better, and too young to die.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}
{"album": "Drum Money", "artist": "Ekiti Sound", "description": "We are lucky enough to be living in a time when musicians from across the globe are increasingly able to define their own terms of engagement. Thanks to the internet, artists can compete in the global sonic marketplace without the kind of patronage or “discovery” by European and North American musicians that characterized   of the ‘80s. In the case of South African amapiano, some of the earliest adopters were Afrobeats DJs in Nigeria and Ghana, who helped it gain a global foothold. As a result, more and more artists are forging their own sounds from a mixture of local and international vernacular. Leke Awoyinka aka   is the perfect example: Raised between Lagos and London, his songs combine influences from both Nigeria and the UK British not because of some premeditated “musical fusion,” but simply because it reflects his own life. On his second album,  , Awoyinka raps, chants, and sings in London slang and Yoruba, as his music touches on British jungle and broken beat; hip-hop, both classic and modern; classic  ; and more. But he’s not fusing these elements—he’s finding common ground and points of connection between them, mapping out a cultural space in which to act out his dramas. Sonically he’s a million miles away, but it’s philosophically similar to the way David Bowie pulled together his equal love of rock, soul, music hall, chanson, and Vegas schmaltz. Another crucial element is Awoyinka’s extraordinary production. Part of the way he’s able to make the myriad elements flow together is because of his love for a wide array of sounds—whether it’s a horn section, an ‘80s funk synth stab, a raw bleep, a cut-up breakbeat, or hefty hand percussion. The drums in particular sound absolutely stellar here—something that’s clearly on his mind given not just the album’s title, but also its lyrics: “I got drum money,” “I have a tom-tom heartbeat.” The songs go from total celebration to wry mischief to politicized anger and back, and from straight-up dancefloor anthems to deep, trip-hop–like poetic musings. The latter features prominently on the final stretch of the album; the contemplative atmosphere draws you deeper into Awoyinka’s world, making you wonder about the roller-coaster that’s led to this point, and making you want to play it all over again.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

The opening track “Mercury,” with its jagged, saw-like synths, captures the unstable nature of its namesake, the fastest planet to spin around Earth. Soft, crumbling explosion sounds are punctuated by oscillations that grow in frequency and intensity. This hostile crescendo leads to textures more benign: tracks “Venus” and “Earth” are ripe with high notes comprised of vocal synths, bubbling surfaces, and field recordings of birds.

The end result was the creation of  , a system of “eight open-source VST plug-ins created for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that emulate the atmospheric conditions of the planets in our solar system,” as the album notes describe. Evidence of this heady process can be found on “Mars,” with its metallic soundscapes that vary between what sounds like a giant, distant bell and muted computer blips. On the standout track “Jupiter,” swishes and oscillations swirl around a sustained drone, building a track so elastic that it is as if the contrasting waves were trying to capture the massive size of the planet and all of its revolving moons and colorful clouds. The more meditative “Neptune” ends the album with a cascade of glitching, filtered effects that rise and die out suddenly, closing off the loop: 41 minutes of space travel that perfectly capture the immense possibilities of sound.", "genre": ["Ambient"]}
{"album": "Slowly Forgettin", "artist": "Martyna Basta", "description": "For   music is as much a confessional process as a creative pursuit. The composer and musician from Kraków, Poland,   her work as an imaginary landscape enveloping a nucleus of her own reality—in other words, she takes her thoughts and feelings about the world around her and lets them run wild. On her debut full-length LP  , she mused upon the scenic surroundings of Eastern Europe by limiting herself to a naturalistic approach; field recordings and her own voice were the primary sources of sound, with only scant instrumentation to support. As her thoughts turned inward to face the abstract, a shift was necessary.   represents a pivot away from the natural and toward the metaphysical. Field recordings remain the jumping-off point of each track, but become far more abstract than on previous efforts. The sounds of Basta’s city are slowly lost in the mix on opener “Presentiment,” giving way to ringing chimes and unintelligible chatter. Unusual use of the human voice is prominent: intermittent sung notes and breathy muttering dot the sparse panorama of “Podszepnik I,” while whispers call and respond to one another on “Slowly Forgetting, Barely Remembering” like a conversation overheard just barely within earshot. Like-minded audio autobiographer   lends her voice to “It Could Be As It Was Forever,” aided by Auto-Tune and backed by jagged violin. Basta gets closest to conventional singing on “Podszepnik II,” gradually stacking a heavenly chorus up into a haunting howl as she plucks out a simple melody on her guitar. The light use of guitar throughout the album seems consequential to her creative turn, too. It’s an instrument she abandoned following her training as a classical guitarist, but has rekindled her relationship with in an experimental context. Basta’s work is often described as diaristic, but rather than a musical memoir,   reads more like an emotive, impressionist sketch. Vague forms approximate places she’s been, and broad strokes imply the movements she’s making. The details aren’t clear, but they don’t have to be; the feeling is all there.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

And although she began the creative process for   in Karachi, Pakistan, her second album is as rooted in this world as she is. In other words, much of it draws from a rarefied and long-gone era of British music: that of Manchester before Madchester and everywhere before Britpop. That of phone-free warehouse raves that have since become the stuff of legend. That of Glastonbury when weekend tickets cost a whopping 50 pounds. It mines the moments just before the British underground got hip again and turned into an international export worth gazillions—when the words “Gallagher brothers” still meant nothing to anyone, perhaps. It’s all here: old-school acid house; ‘90s trance; the cool detachment of Depeche Mode and Pet Shop Boys; a bit of going-nowhere-fast shoegaze. Lyrically, like the rave greats before her, she knows how to rely on the feel and rhythm of a phrase (especially repeated enough times to resemble a chorus) rather than try to convey too much meaning through it. This is done nowhere better perhaps than on “This World Couldn’t See Us” with the line, “You can have it all in return for everything.” Later, on the irresistible “Gentle Heart,” she invokes the time-honored motif of the girl going out and letting the music set her free: “She rides through the night/ So soft and so free/ This huge moving city is all hers to keep.” We dare you not to feel it. Iqbal is particularly adept at letting everything breathe, be it that groove on “Gentle Heart” or the beguilingly repetitive riff on “Lilac Twilight,” which serves as an intermission. Her songs are loosely constructed, bookended by elongated intros and outros. Opening track “In Light” is pure atmosphere, bordering on ambientronica in places. She never does everything all at once, instead tucking a sitar flourish or tiny harmonic departure behind a steady riff. She weaves quick drum machine taps between a pulsing bassline, reigning it in at just the right moment so the synths soar unimpeded.   has a peculiar loping quality to it, almost that of running in slow motion—a sensation, it’s worth noting, that is nothing if not the stuff of dreams.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Karma 業", "artist": "P.H.0", "description": "In Ken Liu’s   series, the Chinese American science fiction author expands on his vision of “silkpunk”: not “Asian-flavored steampunk” nor “Asian-influenced fantasy,” but a particular aesthetic which constitutes a “re-appropriation and rejuvenation of tradition” as a type of alternative worldbuilding from the Pacific. The latest album from   a group of New York City-based artists making “east asian cyber-metal” [sic] strives in a similar direction, mixing traditional-sounding pentatonic melodies with a potpourri of genres both brutal and futuristic, from industrial EBM to retrofuturistic synthwave. Though it stumbles at moments,   reimagines what Asian music might sound like. A distant suona heralds the beginning of “Vanity 虛妄.” After the short introduction, gravelly guitars and syncopated toms take things in a more conventionally metal direction, albeit with a synthesized twist. Then—two minutes in, the intensity dissolves, giving way to a post-rock interlude that features an   solo supported by a wistful guitar line. A minute later, and there’s a synthwave drop, heavily compressed and undulating with each kick, after which they conclude the track with a heavy breakdown. Packing a ranging mix of sounds into just under five minutes, the track is a glorious mess that encapsulates the band’s willingness to take risks. Some of these choices pay off, while others don’t land quite as well. “Yè 業” starts off strong, with a pentatonic riff over a measured blitz of guitar and electronics, but their first lyrics break any spell the introduction might have cast with a bit of Weezer-esque cheese: “A Japanese CPU dreams of electric sheep while the system sleeps.” “Wu Wuo 無我” exhibits a similar tension between their progressive sound and sometimes weary subject matter. Beginning with a minimalistic 4×4 beat—we’re deep in techno territory now—they slowly introduce droning   and distorted bass. Then comes George Orwell, with lines from 1984 narrated by a vaguely British voice: “We will abolish the orgasm. There will be no loyalty except loyalty to the Party.” The title of the track translates to “anatta,” the Buddhist concept of non-self; it sounds like a bit of an on-the-nose critique of communism in the Pacific. It’s in these moments when the band dips a little too far into “Asian-influenced fantasy,” the typical sonic signifiers of East Asia used as window dressing for well-worn themes of Asian authoritarianism—yet P.H.0 nevertheless explore musical combinations with a full-throated earnestness that bears fruit in bursts of creativity.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Like Broadcast and Stereolab before them, the duo of DIY stalwarts Ray Monde and Kris Chau pull from the kitschy future-bachelor-pad sounds of artists like Nino Nardini, uncovering the heady properties contained within. On their sophomore album,  , the band sharpen their approach, lacing their twisty songwriting with lush production and playful, ping-ponging rhythms. Combining overtones of bossa nova with a thick haze of psychedelia, Monde UFO’s jams warble along with an elevator music–like bliss. When the paranoid shuffle of “Rectory” kicks in with its ghostly vibraphones, it feels like getting lost in an office building of endlessly interlocking hallways. Monde and Chau tap directly into this modern sense of horror in their lyrics as well. On “Government Employee,” they whisper in a drawled tone about “live stream funerals” and professional opportunities that come “for just a little demoralizing fee,” singing their shaggy dog stories as if they were talking through the other end of a payphone whose signal keeps cutting out. For all its oddities,   is an album of sumptuous sonic details. The soft nylon string guitar flowing through “The Woods Behind St. Martha” sounds as if it’s wafting down from a nearby balcony, while the woodblocky chimes punctuate “Garden of Agony” with a luminescent, alien glow. In these moments, Monde UFO taps into a beautifully surreal plane halfway between fantasy and reality.", "genre": ["Ambient", "dream pop"]}

In songs built from a series of mantra-like vocal loops, the artist Ayo Leilani appropriates the notion of psychic warfare to explore her experiences with seizures. On the opening track, “Lucid,” the sound of cresting waves calmly lulls listeners as Leilani’s voice offers assurance that it’s all just a dream, her layered vocals flowing and ebbing like the tide. Like 2018’s  and 2020’s  the songs on   are pulled from a lush palette of jazz and trip-hop—audible in the shimmering “Dreaming,” featuring  , and the bare-bones boom bap drums on “Bird’s Eye View (O.B.E.)” and “Save Me.” Leilani’s delivery often has a stripped-down minimalism, which pairs well with the muted trumpets and smooth guitar on “Dizzy” and “Aura.” In other moments, the arrangements skew even sparser, embracing a deliberate simplicity. On the torch-bearing “I’m Sad,” Leilani turns the lights down until all that’s left are her own vocal loops and piano, with a string ensemble slowly joining in soulful mourning. Soul and jazz might inform Witch Prophet’s music, but  also toys with contemporary hip-hop production more than her previous work. On the  -assisted “Memory,” jazz arrangements are supplemented by a chorus of pitch-bent,trap hi-hats. The wonky drill beat of “Fire” is paired with a classical guitar that wouldn’t sound out of place on a YoungBoy Never Broke Again or   single. The Fugees–like “Energy Vampire” supplements a groovy bassline with an Auto-Tuned rap verse from  . On the closing track, “God Universe Magic (G.U.M.),” Leilani describes her lyrics as “speaking spells.” More than any one sound or style,  is a showcase for the richness of Leilani’s voice.

{"album": "Silver Haze", "artist": "SQÜRL", "description": " was born to score the surreal. The duo, composed of filmmaker and icon of the New York underground Jim Jarmusch and film producer and musician Carter Logan, formed to provide the score for Jarmusch’s opaque spy thriller  (2009). Glacially paced, elliptically structured, and full of mysterious, tight-lipped characters, the film is uniquely enigmatic. Fittingly, it also marked the debut recordings of Sqürl (then known as Bad Rabbit), who lend gnarled guitar drones, otherworldly kosmische, and hazy screwed-up feedback to a soundtrack that also includes fellow travelers through rock music’s outer limits like  ,  , and  . Across a handful of   as well as scores for other Jarmusch films—including the skeletal, unsettling drones in 2013’s   and the hauntological synth music for  —Sqürl have since established themselves as masters of unsettled moods, bringing dreary depth and thorny texture to whatever sounds they explore on a given project. Their debut album,  , feels like a culmination of the meditative, monolithic music they’ve recorded to date. Swirling together frigid memories of no wave, heavy-lidded desert rock, and grayscale ambiance, the record feels crushingly heavy but deceptively elusive; a feedback-laden dream of a dying world. There’s a creeping sense of encroaching apocalypse that’s present from the very start of the record. Lead single “Berlin ‘87,” though explicitly inspired by Jarmusch’s memories of living in the German cultural hub, is a bleak tangle of foreboding guitar lines—paced so that each sludgy melody arrives a little slower than you might expect. It feels damp and mud-streaked, the sort of grim instrumental that’s built to suck you into its gloom. On “The End of the World,” Jarmusch makes the project’s ominousness explicit, gravely intoning a story about teenagers tearing through the end times as more distorted drones waver and roil like the last wisps of smoke rising from a stomped-out fire. Whether his spoken-word explorations are oracular sermonizing or merely speculative fiction, it’s a compelling way to set the tone for the rest of the record that unfolds, an omen of impending doom. Collaboration has always been at the core of Sqürl, both in the alchemistic interplay of Logan and Jarmusch’s experiments, as well as with outside players including lutist Jozef Van Wissem (who contributed heavily to the  score) as well as occasional guest vocalists like Cults’s Madeline Follin. It’s always seemed to lend their downcast, slow-moving music a sense of direction and purpose—a somewhat hopeful idea that if they’re going to trod through these desolate expanses, they will do so with company and camaraderie.  doubles down on this side of their work, welcoming guests on half of its tracks, including appearances from the British singer-songwriter Anika, experimental guitarist Marc Ribot, and French pop mutator and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. At their best, these tracks offer moments of light and peace amid the somber proceedings. Gainsbourg’s contribution especially—to the overcast “John Ashbery Takes A Walk”—feel piercing and powerful, the sort of performance that overtakes the atmosphere and transforms it into something new. There’s heaviness still, for sure, but her whispered, abstract poetry lends their sound new depth, turning the uneasy instrumental into something more complicated, more beautiful. Moments like these showcase the strange power of Sqürl. Exploratory and never didactic, they follow all of their boldest impulses. And while they seem most comfortable in the darkness, they don’t restrain themselves to one style or sound. As a result,  is a labyrinthine but rewarding record that reveals more detail and complexity the more you’re willing to submit to its strange rhythms.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "Turbulence and Pulse", "artist": "Asher Gamedze", "description": "In the opening scene of director Dylan Valley’s 17-minute documentary   (2023), Cape Town-based jazz drummer   is shown driving on a coastal highway talking about time and history. Gamedze explains his view of history in dynamic terms: “not being unfinished,” “unfolding,” and “something that people can actually create.” The idea that history is not the result of a metaphysical predetermining force centers humanity, proposing to us that it is human social activity as the engine that drives the whole enterprise. Created as a companion piece to Gamedze’s   also called  , the film not only documents the work that Gamedze does to articulate the musical aspect of his ideas—it also shows him and comrades   and   wrestling with the social and political implications of these ideas. What is history and who gets to make it? How do the events of the past shape our present and future? These are the primary themes that inform the album. The opener “Turbulence’s Pulse” sets the tone with a rich, searching piano and a monotone chant reminding us that “turbulent times call for extreme measures…” Gamedze’s drum pattern here is a loose, swinging anchor holding the music together as the speaker reflects on how both musical time and historical time are created by humans working together. “Wynter Time” is a nine-minute epic of exploratory improvisation. After the ensemble opens, playing freely, the tune’s elegant, regal melody gives way to an inventive tenor sax solo by Buddy Wells. “Locomotion” is a driving drum and percussion-heavy tune that showcases the band’s ability to marry bebop’s melodic conventions with open-eared free playing. Robin Fassie and Wells’s solos on trumpet and tenor sax respectively are fierce and bassist Thembinkosi Mavimbela shines with a big, heavy tone and intricate lines. Contrasting the more fiery pieces with softer, more contemplative moments, Gamedze’s ensemble is capable of playing with great sensitivity and attention to detail on tunes like “Melancholia” and “Out Stepped Zim.” By now, jazz improvisation as a musical metaphor for liberal ideas about democracy is a well-worn and widespread cliché. Despite this, there is something important to be gleaned from how this music has taught us to work together to change our circumstances. Jazz and history have two essential things in common: They don’t exist without human initiative and collaboration. We are the driving force behind it all and by acknowledging and understanding that, we can write a new story as the future unfolds before us.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

French found outlets for release in the   or by taking a   on the stylings of  . Her latest album comes with a name change—a playful shortening to  —and a shift in sound to follow suit, pushing her music’s capacity for releasing stress into bolder territory. On  , French works in bigger and more confident forms of electronic pop than before without sacrificing her easygoing outlook. With influences ranging from Kylie Minogue to SOPHIE, French’s style is freewheeling, fluidly blitzing through languid dream pop (“california”) and pitched-up house (“beep beep”). On “black ferrari,” French’s pulsing, four-on-the-floor beat races and her newfound exhilaration is effervescent as she sings, “I never felt like this before.” Club-ready big beat highlight “gemmy juice” best exemplifies the expansiveness of French’s new approach, suddenly flipping to the low-end for a Sarah Bonito hook indebted to the iconic drops of Basement Jaxx. What unites everything on   is its persistent vibe of blissed-out haze acting as a protective shroud against the pressures of the outside world. Each piece of the album title gets a track of its own, embodying different forms of escape via hyperpop house (“cbd”), ethereal jungle instrumentals (“reiki”), or interdimensional shoegaze/vaporwave transmissions (“moonbeam”). The occasional 180s between inspirations and modes only adds to how loose and free the record feels, with a palpable enthusiasm that never allows the endorphin high to dip for too long. If there’s any track that best embodies what Lindsey French accomplishes with a new sonic palette at her disposal, it’s “daydream.” Though never veering from the song’s laid-back pop vibe, French subtly adds small flourishes to keep things bubbly—a synth string solo in one moment, a triumphant trumpet loop the next. Even at a whisper, French’s delicate pitch-shifted vocals soar and her words carry the high of love: “Chemicals burning inside/ Constellations shining in your eyes.” Whether by taking a deep breath or spending a night on the dancefloor,   represents a re-centering of the self.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"]}

The New York rapper’s profile is almost always obscured in press photos and music videos, both in his work as a solo artist and as a member of the duo  . But on  , woods’s latest full-length collaboration with prolific producer  , there’s a new level of comfort and intimacy—as if he’s showing his face without giving himself away. Where 2019’s   was peppered with heady political references and snippets of cutthroat dialogue from  , there’s a sense of warmth to  , even though woods hasn’t sacrificed the strength of his convictions. Opener “Kenwood Speakers” is fueled by a frustration at the state of his city and society at large, culminating in a fantasy of revenge directed at his gentrifying neighbors: “I turn the music up incrementally and told mischievous lies/ I whispered in the host’s ear all night/ I heard they found him in the morning, hose run from the exhaust pipe.” On songs like “NYC Tapwater,” he sounds more at ease—still in tune with the world around him, but chilled-out. Segal’s ragga-tinged drums sound massive, providing a solid concrete foundation for Woods to build upon. There are jazz flourishes, like the looping piano line on “The Layover” or the eerie horns of “Hangman,” and the Blue Note-riffing “Blue Smoke” brings a smoky jazz lounge to life, all pitter-patter cymbals and chaotic double bass. Segal deconstructs soulful samples into wonky loops and layers them in tape hiss, but his production is mostly informed by the trippy unpredictability of dub. The  –featuring “Year Zero” brews jagged feedback and retro synth sounds into a menacing concoction. In lighter moments, there’s an almost bedroom pop flavor to his lo-fi beats, with gentle guitar loops on tracks like “Soft Landing” and “Houdini” that wouldn’t sound out of place on an early Baths project. ends on a poignant note, with woods’s reflecting on both the innate trippiness of parenthood and how it inevitably confronts you with your own mortality: “I watch him grow wondering how long I’ve got to live.” woods’s verse is reflective of the entire album’s philosophy on impending change. There’s a particularly bittersweet feeling to living in a city that changes so much, where personal memories are constantly paved over by developers, every happy moment tinged with the sad knowledge that the streets you’re walking may not look the same tomorrow.

The singer’s new album,  , follows the same path of experimentation, but veers further into pop territory for a dreamy and danceable joyride. Murray opens the album with “Come In,” a sparse track with a chiptune-like loop underscoring his baritone chant. It’s enthralling and inviting; a siren song leading you into the water. He comes back to this meditative space frequently throughout the album, but the backbone of Murray’s music is experimentation—on  , the only constant is change. You can hear the sounds of the mid-2010s New York City electronic underground scene on “Empty,” a soulful track with electro-pop synths and slowed-down house beats. “Give Me a Reason,” a song about an all encompassing love that comes to an end, is a rapid Detroit techno–style track aimed squarely at the dancefloor. The mood and tempo of each track makes the record sound like the passing of seasons, with Murray taking us through the cities and scenes that have influenced him as an artist. “Köln,” sung in German, features a soaring synth loop and Murray’s soft croon—it easily suggests a spring afternoon in one of the sprawling gardens and parks of Berlin or Cologne. “Sora Ni Mau Maboroshi,” a cover of an obscure 1980s song by Japanese new wave band  , is a strange but soothing album closer. Murray recreates the Japanese new wave song into a crisp bass track with a hypnotizing looped piano.

Nostalgia is the animating factor of  Lifted by featherlight hi-hat flourishes and interspersed with scratchy audio from a home movie, album opener “Healing” establishes a warmth and airiness the remainder of the record never abandons. “I Smile For E” is about mourning without ever being melancholy, celebrating a beloved family member’s life with a chorus of saxophone trills. On “From A Sandbox,” Jamalifard inventories her happy childhood with inviting simplicity: “We told secrets and we promised we would keep them ‘til we died/ Our moms would call us and we’d wander on back for the night.” It ends with a beautiful, unaccompanied birdsong. Buoyed by an ultra cool walking bassline, “Hesitations” catalogs experiences with an ex she longs to have again—long phone calls and good sex—before addressing just how slyly dangerous that nostalgia can be: “Temptation talking to me/ And I like the way she sounds/ Dangerous feelings pushing through me/ I can barely hold my ground.” In other words, she knows what she’s feeling  .

{"album": "Bird Hour", "artist": "7ebra", "description": "Is it time to conclusively redraw the boundaries of the all-too-prescriptive term “bedroom pop?” After all, garage and house music doesn’t need to have been played at their original namesakes—New York’s Paradise Garage and Chicago’s Warehouse—to be deemed legit. Could an album concentrate, redefine, and update the genre of bedroom pop if it wasn’t literally made in a bedroom?   the excellent debut from Swedish duo  , comprised of twins Inez and Ella Johansson, suggests it might. As noted in the album’s liner notes, “the origins of 7ebra [started] with Inez whiling away the hours playing guitar in her bedroom,” anticipating   particular feel, its grain. The arrangements are sparse (each instrument seems siloed in its own wool-lined space), with production as warm and desiccated as a dusty sunlit sill. Supposedly lacking a studio’s arsenal of sonic material, bedroom pop is typically made with limited resources—and though 7ebra did record in a studio (an important thing to note), they also reconfigure familiar sounds throughout: no-nonsense, slightly plastic-y organs; the clean-to-dirty-to-clean guitar tones; those dehydrated drums that  ,  , and   around an uncanny valley between real and fake. This minimalist approach is not imposed, but instead suggests a kind of deliberate, aesthetic hyper-restriction. There’s nothing slapdash about  , though. The languid, lullaby-ish melodies on “Rude Boy,” “Done With The Day,” and “Secretly Bad” are deceptively simple; only a faultless convergence of feeling and precision achieves that super-subtle trace of grit in the delivery of the line “tell me a story where you pretend.” Rich, deftly-layered harmonies on “Lighter Better” and “Lean” overlap in such a way that they could be composed of five voices, as opposed to two. Often panned left and right, the harmonies’ spacing suggests the sisters taking respective spaces around the same microphone, perhaps huddled together in a shared bedroom, a sock for a pop filter. Sisterhood seems woven into the lyrics too. Sly, shy, and diaristic, they’re filled with reflective phrases like “how the hell am I supposed to feel?” that seem directed inwards, or at a listener already familiar with the context. Some lines have the stop-start prosody of a story relayed to a confidant, the adoption of different registers to flesh out the roles; a key dichotomy seems to be between what was said and what could have been said. The scattergun topics and heavy repetition of thoughts (“Wakey Wakey” and “Born To Care” both contain one line repeated ad infinitum) suggest either internal monologue or unloading onto someone close. “Secretly Bad,” “Stripey Horsey,” and “I Have A Lot To Say” are characterized by sentiments and admissions often only possible in private. The close, airless quality of the vocals (notched with the faintest telephone EQ) suggests voice notes recorded just after a messy emotional climax. Though 7ebra’s music both evokes domestic space and seems created in domestic space, their praxis demands non-bedroom pop techniques in order to properly construct such perfectly-formed pocket symphonies. In stretching its parameters slightly too far,   arrives at a meta, almost hyperreal version of bedroom pop, a kind of bedroom pop sublime.", "genre": ["Pop", "indie rock"]}
{"album": "Position", "artist": "PANGAR", "description": ", the duo of DJ/producers Kwalud and Betnwaar, are based in Réunion Island, an isolated French colony in the Indian Ocean. Réunion has no indigenous culture of its own—it was uninhabited until French settlement in the 17th century. Its population’s heritage—via slavery and trade routes—came from Africa, India, Europe, Madagascar, China, and elsewhere, and its culture is a constantly evolving fusion of all of those and more. PANGAR emphasize that quality heavily on their latest,  , with voiceovers proclaiming the power of hybridity and “open thoughts, creole thoughts” on “(cHAo$ MonDe).” Their beats are built for a world in flux, with dancehall, Afro-Latin soundsystems, techno, industrial, even heavy metal all in the mix. As the mention of “metal” might suggest, this is not all hip-grinding party music. But it’s not   that, either. Though there’s a lot of distortion and plenty of threatening atmospheres, the mixdowns are super tight, and the finely crafted dynamics and punchy riffs give it the same thrill-ride sensation as heavyweight ‘90s techno and breakbeat—even when the tempo is down at a low and slow dancehall lope. Like a lot of the output from the Uganda label  , PANGAR expertly tread the tightrope between aggro experimentalism and the pleasure principle. Perhaps appropriately for a tropical island known as much for its unspoiled jungle and long clean beaches as its colonial rule and military outposts, this often feels like music for a rave on the edge of the world. Its function will change with context: It’s possible to imagine, say, the acid dancehall of “lucy#97424” working equally well when mixed into   and bashment with sirens and MCs upping the party energy, as it would in and amongst  -style industrial dub bleakness for darker, moodier clubs.

The title is apt as the band digs deep on this record, building songs with lofty arrangements and sprawling experimentation, pulling together what sounds like a mixed bag of art rock, Britpop, and trip-hop, which they quaintly call “Paisley Pop.” Underneath all the album’s layers of psychedelic texture, eloquent noise, and ambition lies thoughtful and deeply catchy songs, riddled with infectious choruses from beginning to end. For the last few years Daisies have been tirelessly prolific—this is their seventh studio release since 2019—and they show no sign of slowing down. At this level of output, bands often face creative fatigue, and eventually release some overly produced conceptual trash; Daisies, however, are just hitting their stride.   is braver than previous releases, taking risks with freakier, denser, almost breakbeat rhythms, tangles of synth and samples, and springing unpredictable plot-twists in the arrangements while the songwriting solidly pulls you in. None of the individual Daisies’ creative efforts feel jarring or distracting but rather add to the album’s mesmerizing atmosphere. “Blue Cowboy” bounces along with a dizzying dance beat while the vocals croon and drift in the front of the mix, sweetly sounding like a lost track from a Gus Van Sant movie. “Goin’ In Circles” is upbeat and dense with more space to let the gold sounds ring out. The song itself cruises along effortlessly while the lyrics allude to a more tumultuous journey. “Is It Any Wonder” has a coffee shop–rock, ‘90s radio hit vibe, but, you know, not corny. The chorus instantly feels familiar, like something you’ve heard a thousand times before—so much so that you might check twice just to make sure it isn’t some cover lingering in the back of your brain. You’re singing along, completely immersed, and then as the song comes to a head, they hit you with the reverse guitar effect and it’s just so good. To top it off, this record is being co-released by long time legends   and  , who are newer but already have a stacked roster of indie gems. It seems that   has found its place in this world. This music isn’t try-hard. If anything, it’s shockingly poppy and positive, and still feels akin to and informed by classic punk and underground rock.

In the ensuing years, she’s gradually closed that gap, incorporating more piano sketches (the exquisite performances of which were honed by her years of training and competition) as well as her voice, fragile and whispered. Finding near perfection in every element of her oeuvre to date—electronic and natural modulations of voice; layers of synth and field recordings; trembling piano impressions that leave no follicle unflexed— feels like a gut punch and tender caress at the same time. “I can be everything,” says Liyou alongside a detuned piano. “A son/ A daughter/ Spring.” A moment during the denouement of “April in Paris (봄),” before a sampled interview and orchestral swell close out the track, this revelation is bittersweet. A “dog dream” (개꿈), after all, is a flight of fancy, one that Liyou needs to be reminded of. The three tracks that comprise the 38 minutes of (개꿈) might be closer to movements in a symphony, each centered around a different entity whom Liyou addresses—in “April in Paris (봄),” it’s the titular April (“A month, a season” and a “woman”), who might speak into existence all the facets of Liyou’s gender identity. In the title track, the addressee is a lover who might “지켜봐” (watch over) Liyou. These whispered words close out a devastating 14 minutes of bilingual, poetic longing; electronic shimmer and drone; and aching piano improvisations. At about 11 minutes and 20 seconds, the musical elements converge into a moment of pure catharsis as the bass and piano lines resolve and dissipate. In the aftermath, Liyou sings in a voice quivering yet clear: “Why can’t I depend on me?/ Why can’t I bend for me?/ Why can’t you depend on me?/ When I need someone to need me?” She yearns for another from whom they might receive—and give back—words of love, the simple reciprocity that drives human existence yet eludes their best efforts. The final movement “Fold The Horse (종이접기)” refers to the art of origami (  in Korean), the subjectivities of paper horse and narrator folding together by the end of the track. Amid warbling birds and synth melodies that evoke a video game sanctuary, Liyou narrates a surreal, somnambulant story with a vocal doubling that shifts in and out, blurring the boundary between Self and Other: “We pleat/ Mine/ Yours.” Before you know it, we’ve been absorbed into Liyou’s dreamscape, and the album is already over—the only thing left to do is to play it back.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

Vaporwave’s reckless use of samples, sea of anonymous artists, free-of-charge ethos, and embrace of sounds and styles often looked down upon by common tentpoles of taste set it apart so much that many critics at the time rejected it completely.

The compilation leads us down a heavenly hallway of vaporwave’s greatest hits, cruising through various phases:  ’s funky “intercast インターキャスト” shimmies and bustles with its booming snare hits, while   cranks the distortion into oblivion on the crunched up VHS jam “IBM Lotus Night.”  ’s “Chatroom” grooves on a syrupy waiting room slide, rocking the listener into a lull before  ’s own “ホーリーゴースト (holy ghost)” plumbs the uncanny valley with its video game-y chimes and hard-panned, hold music–handclaps. The most disorienting textures may very well go to  ’s “Mr. Icy Bones,” whose marimba-like synths ricochet around in all directions as the footwork-y beat races frantically underneath. Between the compilation’s hands-in-the-air future funk ( ’s “愛-MEETING POINT”), slowed-down lounge mirages  ’s “呼吸蒸気”), and dreamy ‘90s dance vignettes ( ’s “Xylitol”),   captures vaporwave’s many different faces, underlining the inherent playfulness of the genre. Beyond all its musical subversions and undercutting of capitalist tropes, Business Casual’s latest compilation is above all a fun listen—a way to enjoy vaporwave not just for its conceptual heavy lifting, but for its hypnotic sonic pleasures.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Album closer “Sensitivity Training” plays like a Dick Dale surf track blasting in the clattering depths of an iron smelting facility. Downtempo “The Driving Rain (18)” is slow but unflinching, thanks to arpeggiated bass, vocoded singing, and fabricated tom flourishes.

These various musical and political influences coalesce in a record just under 20 minutes long. While his   was deeply personal, combining heartfelt crooning, wonky beats and club-ready electronics, Youniss takes a more punk approach on  . Infusing live drums with glitched-out guitar fuzz and politically charged bars, he reckons with a world still entrenched in anti-Blackness. “What becomes of yesterday’s riots?” asks Anthony Reed in his book   Youniss grapples with the same question on  , inspired in part by the vernacular avant-garde mode that Reed traces in collaborations between Black poets and musicians. “And do you still care for me?” Youniss growls amid a squealing string sample in the opening track, calling out a seeming return to normal after 2020’s uprisings against police brutality. Breaking into a stream-of-consciousness spoken word segment, he gradually begins to shout as breakbeats and metallic skronk match his crescendoing voice. “Black soundwork,” Reed writes, “in all its varieties noisily calls into question the Western tradition’s predicates and aesthetics.” Similarly, Youniss’s distorted voice shuttles between genres, informed by sounds and politics that attempt to make sense of a world structured by racial prejudice. The next two tracks seem to go back in time, with his lyrics in “How Will It End” meditating on the hopeful anxiety of 2020’s righteous energy: “My face is Black like night to day/ They liked me more when I had nothing to say,” he raps. “Arms bent back/ Feel them crack,” he continues on the next track, bursting into anguished cries that accentuate the song’s irregular meter. Uniting the combative rapping of these first tracks and the emotional heft of the second half’s AutoTuned crooning is Tim Caramin’s live drumming, sampled and chopped into dynamic breakbeats. “Negative Space” boasts frenetic, jungle-ish breaks that skitter around granular synths, while the final track brings things to the ground with a deep Reese bass and trudging kick-snare pattern that match Youniss’s plaintive singing. “I don’t wanna go/ I don’t wanna leave” sings Youniss, but he’s said all he needs to; when a guitar riff comes back in to signal a potential reprise, it’s a false alarm, and the album concludes rather suddenly.

{"album": "Walk the Wheel", "artist": "Truth Cult", "description": " hail from the famous Baltimore-D.C. hardcore scene, but on their second album,  they branch out into swaggering, eccentric rock ‘n’ roll. Lead vocalist Paris Roberts is geared more towards showmanship than beatdowns; guitarist Ian Marshall’s riffs are feverish and frenzied rather than crushing; there are piano and saxophone forays, not mosh parts. Take the breakneck opening track “Squeeze”: the guitars are chaotic and discordant, the vocals rabid and breathless as Roberts howls about paranoia and panic. It’s pure, primal punk, a show of visceral abandon. Yet the band can also slow things down and take some moments of deliberate cool. “Resurrection” pairs an impassioned Roberts performance in the verse with harmonic  ’s, hooky guitars, and a disaffected melodic vocal by bassist/co-vocalist Emily Ferrara in the chorus. “Kokaine Kommando,” with its super-slick bass, hi-hat, and hand-clap intro, provides the record’s cockiest moment and one of its best. Roberts shines as a frontman, his presence commanding and vital. He has fun, introducing guitar solos with  ‘s and  ‘s, without being hammy. His emotions, all tangled rage and fear and rapture, are palpable and intense with every line he cries. On the heart-rending “Naked In The End,” in a rare melodic part for him as he duets with Ferrara, he’s almost wailing. The lyrics, co-written by Roberts, Ferrara, and Marshall, are poetic and thematically complex but never pretentious or wordy. “Clearskin” is a reflection on the ultimate unknown of death that’s at once comforting and ominous. “You either believe in God or ghosts but nothing in between,” Roberts snarls. “Naked In The End” is a dreamlike chronicle of despairing grief. There are a lot of allusions to nature across the album, such as a snowstorm on “Resurrection,” stars and the southern lights on “Clearskin,” a river and a hill representing change on “What Is Time?” These metaphors lend emotional depth to Truth Cult’s jagged, unpredictable sound, balancing its brute force with tragic beauty.", "genre": ["Punk"]}

Its opening triptych sets the scene: “Lé Depart” is a gorgeous tune backed by a dreamy instrumental, Oasis taking listeners on a flight above the clouds. “Get It Got It” kicks things into full gear with its swinging groove and uplifting brass section. The song is packed with rich details—swooning harmony vocals, Adi Oasis’s tasteful bass work, and a dynamic audio mix. “Serena” is a bouncy, mid-tempo groove that pays homage to Serena Williams. But from there,  ’s lyrical themes start to drift between the personal and the political. On “Red To Violet,” Oasis partners with Chicago soul artist   to take shots at men who lie and drain women’s emotional energy, knocking down oppressors and obstructors and placing themselves in a position of power: “I’ll take the pilot seat/ You ain’t never given me nothing/ Move. I’m just trynna say something.” “Dumpalltheguns” opens with a trippy backward tape effect before launching into a tight, muscular groove, Oasis laying down a  staccato bassline before stepping to the mic to deliver an impassioned commentary on the pervasiveness of violence and gun culture. “U Make Me Want It” is an ecstatic love song flush with passion and augmented by a bubbling bassline and soaring, Minnie Riperton-style  ’s.  is an impressive feat.

{"album": "Manzanita", "artist": "Shana Cleveland", "description": "Whether fronting rock band   or on her own with an acoustic guitar,   has spent her musical career peeking behind the veil of this world, and her oeuvre brims with songs about wandering other realms, communing with creatures who walk beside her unseen, wishing to fade from existence entirely or walk into the sun. But she’s thinking differently these days. “I am a ghost and I’m trying to show you what I do/ Can I come through/ Through you?,” Cleveland sings on “A Ghost,” the Mellotron-tinged lullaby that opens  , her second full-length under her own name. The supernatural imagery is typical for Cleveland in addition to being something of a callback to the title track of 2019’s  , where she also imagined herself a ghost. But whereas then Cleveland took the point of view of a menacing presence who lurked in the walls and promised that “when I come for you/ I’ll freeze your blood,” on   she seeks corporeal passage to a Californian fantasia where love is real and spring returns eternally and the human body is a vessel for the most mystical of things: new songs and new souls. Motherhood—specifically new motherhood—is the purview of  . The songs were written while Cleveland was pregnant and immediately after her son’s birth—nature’s very own side A and side B—and the record is a document of both the creation of a new life and a new way of living. It is also an ode to the rural part of California where Cleveland lives with her son and partner, musician   who contributes keyboards, dulcimer, glockenspiel, harpsichord, and synthesizer to   (also here are   and Johnny Goss on bass, and   on pedal steel), and where she writes her songs outdoors all year round. As spring returns to the countryside, Cleveland sees in its blooming a reflection of her own life moving from one season to the next. Like its  ,   is psychedelic folk music softly rendered as a Vermeer—you’ll hear hypnotic fingerpicking, the squeak of fingers sliding steel strings, the low moan of a cello, chiming bells, warm washes of pedal steel, brushed cymbals, and gently pattering drums—but Cleveland’s interpretation of psychedelia has changed, both sonically and spiritually. She’s applied lessons learned from  , where time in  ’s studio led her to the realization that the uncanny crackling of the natural world as it awakens from winter slumber is best conjured by the uncanny nature of synthesized sounds. Augmented at times by low whooshes of white noise, a warbling of dappled keys, or a distant buzzing without an identifiable source, the songs on   make no meaningful distinction between the real and the surreal. What, Cleveland suggests, is more psychedelic than the sudden appearance of bugs in the bedroom on the first day of spring or catching a glimpse of a departed loved one in the face of her son as she plays her guitar on the porch? Cleveland has lost none of her predilection for the eerie, though she deploys it to different ends now. “Quick Winter Sun,” a tale of being caught out by a short winter’s day—notably the only song on   set in that season and one that feels less overtly Californian than inspired by British folk acts of the 1960s—turns post-apocalyptic mid-way through. ”Look, we’re the last humans,” she sings, describing a fumbling walk down a trail in the dark as swallows return to “their houses of mud.” On the spoken word interlude “Ten Hour Drive Through West Coast Disaster,” accompanied only by Mellotron, Cleveland juxtaposes seeing flames over Mount Shasta and “cattle farms out of horror films” with the appearance of rainbows refracted by crystals in a waterfall, her son laughing in her ear—joy and terror existing in the same place. “Will you find a way to love this world?” she wonders. Yet as much as   is a record about the outdoors, it shines in its depictions of interior spaces, which often feel more fantastical than the Californian wilderness where the record is otherwise set. “Gold Tower” is perhaps   apex in this respect, a love song from expectant mother to unborn child so intimate it feels a privilege to be allowed to hear it. Cleveland conjures a world within a world, a liminal meeting place for two on a still night after rain, her voice glowing with emotion as she sings to her “quiet little one made of see-through skin” and marvels at her expanding capacity for love. The defining characteristic of Cleveland’s music has always been its beauty and   is no different: it is a record of beautiful things and beautiful feelings transposed into beautiful songs beautifully played. But what’s new is her sense of serenity. The undercurrent of yearning to know what is unknowable once omnipresent in Cleveland’s work has been quelled—”melted with the snow,” as she sings on “Gold Tower.” The world is no longer a mystery to be solved but simply one to behold and, moreover, one to trust. Where she once fashioned the coming of spring as a precursor to loss, a gift delivered with fingers crossed—“As sure as spring/ Coats our little piece of land in green/ The turning earth takes all of what it brings,” goes   on the  —now she writes movingly of the what it brings back.", "genre": ["Folk", "singer-songwriter"]}
{"album": "Crash Recoil", "artist": "Surgeon", "description": "Say the name  , and most dance music fans will hear a specific sound tailor-made for dark warehouses—think industrial-grade synth work and pounding, abrasive drum programming. And, to be fair, Anthony Child’s most famous alias has been responsible for some of the best blistering techno of the past three decades (not to mention his work as one-half of ). But where Child has excelled is a sense of spaciousness that offsets his drum programming. Aside from the recurring ambient interludes on his records (he can get experimental with  ), his techno releases and DJ sets skew atmospheric. You can hear this all the way back in 1993 in   he founded. The first hour is filled with delicate emotional latticing before he pummels us with unrelenting aggression for the last half hour. On   his first album as Surgeon in five years, Child perfects this balance. Make no mistake about it, this is Techno with a capital “T”—exhibit A: the unforgiving closing track, “Hope Not Hate”—but it’s techno that’s filled with subtlety and drama, as psychedelic as it is visceral. Take the funky opening track “Oak Bank,” dominated by swinging drums and a modular synth line halfway between the elastic grooves of Nick Léon and a vintage rave stab; the distinctive, body-quaking kick doesn’t surface until past the four-minute mark. Even when he is banging it out on a track like “Masks & Archetypes,” he buries melodies and vocal snippets into corners of the stereo like hidden Easter eggs. Elsewhere on  , Child takes an even more ethereal approach. On “Leadership Contest” the snares sound like they might disappear any minute underneath the building pressure of the dusty arpeggio; “Second Magnitude Stars” has a similarly smudged, foggy feel, with thick layers of delay giving way to quivering synths near the end.  What also makes  work so well, though, is that this isn’t just a victory lap for Childs. Child has been keeping up with the Joneses, and there is a specifically contemporary feel to the record, particularly in his loose, occasionally polyrhythmic drum programming and angular synth work. You can hear it on tracks like “We laugh and clap at the circus” and “Metal Pig.” On the former, he brings together Halloween eve creepiness with skittering hand drums, and on the latter, he dissolves a wiry ricocheting melody in a vat of lye over a chugging rhythm. Either of these tracks could have come out on a label like  or   and sit up there with the best UK techno coming out at the moment.  The fact that Tresor is the label putting out the album feels fitting. Both Child and the Berlin institution continue to push techno forward while staying true to its roots.

Maybe   if the writer decided to dig a little deeper. Which is kind of odd considering the singer/multi-instrumentalist/producer has been a solo artist for more than a decade. In fact, at this point, Rose has leaned into her own lane long enough to leave the past behind. 2012’s   was a critical and commercial breakthrough, but on many levels, it was a transitional record—the first clear sign of Rose’s new- and cold wave inclinations. In the 11 years and three LPs that have passed since then, Rose has dabbled in rickety krautrock ( ), a vivid funhouse version of The Cure ( ), and a similar-in-spirit side project ( ). Not an experiment so much as a natural evolution, her solo output has been hinting at a synth-heavy pop record for a while now.  delivers on that directive in spades, beginning with two of its strongest tracks, “Sixteen Ways” and “Anything.” Rather than rely on rope-tightening restraint or elusive sound effects, both singles crash right into their choruses as bubbly drum beats and crystalline keyboards set the scene. The rest of the record maintains that mood while steering clear of a straightforward guitar/bass/drums setup. That goes for everything from the skittering, not-quite-drum & bass break of “Had It Wrong” to the rattle and hum rhythms of “Molotov In Stereo.” The synths that soar and swell throughout “Come Back” prove especially promising for whatever Rose’s next step will be, too; unlike  ’s softer, more atmospheric songs, it reaches for the rafters like New Order and leaves Rose’s longtime fans wanting more of whatever   was. Considering the creative strides she’s made with every album, another move towards the mainstream isn’t just likely at this point, it’s a foregone conclusion—albeit with enough Rose-tinted flourishes to keep things fresh—straight out of the same left-field sphere she’s been operating in since the very beginning.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Most orb-weavers you’re likely to see in the wild are female; many males never spin a web their entire lives. In her twelve-month lifespan, the nocturnal spider spends the majority of her life casting silken webs against the follies of the wind and the wild, destroying her work and beginning anew each night. These large arachnids don’t normally pose a threat to humans, but their webs—  connected by wispy, glistening threads—are dense, large, and imposing, designed to capture any small creature that dares enter its habitat. If you’ve watched a live performance from  , the solo project of New Mexico-based musician Madeline Johnston, you’ll understand what it means to be shrouded in a gauzy haze. Johnston builds her own vocal processors out of old telephone receivers, and at her concert at Brooklyn’s Union Pool last month, the vocal effects were so all-consuming that they began to pick up the sound of cheers and applause from the audience. Soon, the entire crowd became a part of her sound, subsumed by her own dense, large, imposing web of reverb. Across  , Midwife’s new collaborative album with Louisville, Kentucky’s  , source material becomes blurred from its echo, a woven tapestry of layered vocals and guitars that glimmer like its namesake’s hypnotic, dew-studded webs. Johnston and Diaz, who performs as  , originally met online during the isolation of the early pandemic in 2020. Their shared musical influence is obvious. Midwife creates gossamer, self-described “heaven metal” that rests somewhere between the quiet reflections of   and towering post-rock of   while Vyva Melinkolya has worked with musicians like   founder and bedroom pop prodigy   to   inspired equally by   and  .

Midwife’s 2020 album   underscored unnerving lyrics about internalized violence and irreparable self-harm with reflective, plaintive piano melodies. In her past work as Vyva Melinkolya, Diaz layered guitar tones—a dense, base layer of reverb beneath a lighter melodic lead guitar—that acted as a kind of Greek chorus to her nostalgic opines. On  , they combine their approaches: an arpeggiated guitar is the base palette, a soft heartbeat beneath the Hole-inspired opener “Miss America” and a meditative march driving forward the breathless hope of “NMP.” “No more pain,” they sing in unison, eerily determined and yet anesthetized, like true believers in a religious cult. The search for a higher power is a recurring theme on the album—on “Hounds of Heaven,” they reference English writer Francis Thompson’s   about God’s tireless pursuit of the human soul. And yet, even in submitting to the hope of transcendence, they still search for a personal connection: “If it’s all just the same to you/ Would you take my hand?” Throughout the album, they’re humbled not just by the great beyond, but by their own natural surroundings. On “Plague X,” an unsettling narrative about a life spent hiding underground soon reveals itself to be a description of New Mexican summer: “Whitest sand/ Blackest sky/ Brittle bodies/ Yellow eyes,” Johnston chants. When she sings about a “web of lies,” it recalls the album’s titular invertebrate, weaving its silk under the cover of darkness, praying to make it until the next nightfall.

It’s a hub of relentless electro-innovation, and it’s against that backdrop that   (née Sam Austin Radebe) began his career. DJ Black Low is one of the masters of amapiano, which translates to “the pianos” in Zulu or Xhosa, a subgenre that blends various strands of house with lounge music and other influences. His new double LP is an immediate classic of the genre. Released by  —the stellar  that transformed into a fully-functioning record label—the set features popping drum machines, rhythmic synths,   basslines, vibrant vocals, percussive log drums, catchy melodies, and lyrics in local languages. Black Low also welcomes a number of guest producers and vocalists across the album’s 12 songs, many from his native province of Gauteng. (Closer “Drive Through” is the only track where no collaborator receives co-billing). These different voices come together to create a multifaceted but sonically cogent full-length. Much of   offers a wintry, almost brooding take on house music. There’s a slow-burning tension that runs counter to Black Low’s beaming smile on the album’s chirpy yellow cover. “Akulalwa” uses eerie synth chords and slightly distant vocals courtesy of Black R, K.Dalo, and Frego to invoke the feeling of an empty dancehall in the dead of night. “Lepiano” is more than a little reminiscent of the samba classic “Mas Que Nada” by Sérgio Mendes, but with the peppy pianos stripped out in favor of minimalist percussion and synths that feel as though they could be glowing from a streetlight on a deserted road at midnight in Pretoria. The slightly more sinister feel of “Mekete” could be the basis of a UK or Brooklyn drill track. Among the most impressive tunes is “Lovey,” where murky tones sit underneath what resembles ceremonial chanting. But then the pulse of what sounds like a note from an old dance music siren enters, adding a new dimension. So much of this music is built on such contrasts: “Oskido” blends smooth vibraphone playing with evil synths. Different points of the album call on traditional intonations, melodic rapping, and soulful singing. But every track feels clean and precise without being sterile, with no off-putting tension between the various elements. This is less club music and more for the post-club comedown.

That question is the thesis of Bodikhuu’s  , a record that is a tribute to both the megalopolis and an imagined fantasy of it—a place that simultaneously does and does not exist. Hailing from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia,   belongs to the East Asian diaspora, yet his country’s cultural footprint is meager compared to Japan’s capital city. That does not stop him from conjuring something unique out of this geographical exchange, in the form of satisfyingly chill beats. Molded by the internet,   is steeped in the all-too-common “chill vibes” of Japanese iconography online: the fast-lane ‘80s urban ephemera, the tropical flora, and the Day-Glo neon that typifies such revivalism. But Bodikhuu executes all these facets with flair and a tendency not to exaggerate any one attribute, keeping it from spilling over into parody as on “Guest Performance,” which opens with a talk-show presentation, as if Johnny Carson was introducing Buddy Rich, splicing the host’s commentary with chill-out 808s, and then leads into “Night Drive” and its starry boom bap drums. Bodikhuu’s M.O. with   and its prequel,  , makes a lot of sense when it’s noted that Ulaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. This kind of fantastical wanderlust paints a vivid picture of the producer in his daily life as a crane operator. In the wistful imagination, these beats transport the listener to glittering lights in Shinjuku and fancy high-rise apartments in Roppongi. That those exact images might not reflect reality isn’t the point; it’s what’s within Bodikhuu’s mind that counts. Lo-fi hip-hop is rarely successful at situating the listener in a specific place—just listen to the myriad mixes that dot YouTube and see if there’s any difference. So for Bodikhuu to craft beats that evoke a particular location comes as a welcome surprise. His most analogous contemporary would probably be   but even the latter’s tracks tend to conjure up nondescript versions of “paradise.” What makes   special is its fine-tuned examination of what makes Japan tick in the minds of others.

On her latest album,  , she again builds thunderous odes out of morose hums and growling bass pulses, but here, she goes even deeper into the void and deeper into herself—every sound on the album is made using her voice, even though the record often sounds more like Earth’s vibrations than a human singing. While she pushes and pulls her vocals into surprising shapes, her music still feels personal, using these guttural melodies as a vehicle for diving into the darkest areas of the mind and heart.

If she heard crickets chirping nearby, for example, she’d record herself humming along, and later on, she altered them in Ableton. Throughout Fractured Whole, she layers these fragments on top of each other to create densely interwoven packages. On “Precipice,” a bare syncopated groove of nasally  ‘s give way to a simmering, bass-heavy grumble, while on “Inurement,” a  -like track, an eerie rumble loops, looming like the unreachable depths of the ocean. Mitchell’s music is always in a state of evolution, driven by the interaction between her compact phrases. Mitchell’s voice training also comes through in her melodies. As a kid, she  , and while she contorts her voice here, those roots feel alive. The sound of early music serves as a guiding light: The album’s opener “Penance” begins with a simple, forlorn hum that expands into a haunted web that sounds like a medieval hymn, while “Ache of Surrender” sounds like an electrified Gregorian chant. Throughout  , Mitchell sings vowels instead of lyrics, evoking feelings from the textures and timbres of her voice rather than stating them plainly. Those emotions feel their most concrete on the album’s peak, “Reconciliation.” At the start of the track, Mitchell’s voice emerges as a poignant polyphony and gradually morphs into a groove of blown-out basses and otherworldly hums. It creates a feeling of catharsis, a moment of ecstatic release after all the turbulence, and shows how her electronic manipulations produce results that feel natural.

As you move through the ritualistic crescendos of “Seed,” the barking warriors of “Howl,” and the discordant lilt of “Fawn,” it feels like a beautifully realized world of forbidding darkness—very occult, very countercultural. But then, as things go on, the album becomes less about the dark drama of the setting, and you start to notice that   sticking with you. The melodies and phrasing on the songs is quite addictive, and there’s a bounce to the beats, not just militant crashing. While it might well disturb and transgress, this music is pop, too. And that’s when a really odd comparison works its way to the surface: this is kind of like Beyoncé’s  . Not that this   like   Gately’s European folk (and folk horror) sensibility and sonic abrasiveness constantly bring you back to those more experimental influences. But there’s something about the ambition, the confrontation, the refusal of any false duality between pop and avant-garde, and particularly that sense of decades and even centuries of culture bubbling up through the cracks, that feels regally assured in a similar way. The haunted house camp of “Scale” and the cyberpunk techno of “Chaw” are way out on their own, and that anti-pop countercultural weirdness can clash with the hookiness at times. But as ancient New Orleans jazz dances into the finale of “Tame” and “Melt,” it’s hard to think of anyone else mining history over heavyweight beats in such a way.

Airing in 1979, a year before New Order would make its debut performance, the live session exhibited Grey Factor’s lofty ambitions to reinvent Southern California’s burgeoning punk scene in their own electronic image. Spreading four massive synths across the stage, the band produces a dense fog of drones and squelches as a lone guitarist paces back and forth, hammering out trebly chords with dissonant abandon. A backup dancer in a dress wriggles in the background, almost out of sight. Though more than a bit of a mess, Grey Factor’s brush with small-screen stardom was shockingly ahead of its time, creating sardonic synth-pop at a time when only a small handful of bands outside of Europe had even begun to tinker with fully-digital songcraft. Founded in 1978 by Joey Cevetello and Jeff Jacquin—self-proclaimed “bored kids from the San Fernando Valley” who were fascinated by  , Kraftwerk, and  —Grey Factor produced local intrigue with their eerie, industrial sound but disappeared as quickly as they arrived in 1980, leaving only a few hand-dubbed cassettes in their wake. More than 40 years after they were recorded, the band’s complete studio works are getting their first proper physical release. The first half of   features the aforementioned cassette EP in full and features some of the band’s more purely electronic tracks. Opener “You’re So Cool” is a largely instrumental number composed of many intricately layered melody lines weaving through popping snares and lumbering bass.

Side B contains all four tracks from the   EP that Grey Factor, ever defiant, intentionally decided to shelve despite pleas for new music from fans. Bringing a few new members into the fray, the band embraced a more balanced fusion of rock and synth-pop and landed on a sound that resembles Joy Divison’s  , albeit more decorated with   and  . While Grey Factor may have never strayed far from their native suburbs of L.A., the band managed to beat most of the world to the punch on an aesthetic that would dominate the decade that followed.

Alternating between energetic dance numbers and slowed-down ballads,   tackles the moments in her life and in relationships that didn’t work out. Across   are tracks that gradually ease into their truths. Samia’s thoughts and memories are tied together by her confessional and frank lyrics. “I don’t wanna charm you/ I don’t wanna make you mine,” Samia sings over campfire-ready guitar chords on “Charm You” before finally acknowledging that “mostly it’s just I don’t wanna end up crying”—anticipating a heartbreak before it’s even happened. Similarly, the somber album opener “Kill Her Freak Out,” which imagines Samia killing an ex’s new partner, is unhesitant with timeless anguished sentiment, with lines like “I’ve never felt so unworthy of loving.” Samia confronts tougher emotional periods on “Sea Lions,” where she softly deadpans, “I don’t wanna talk/ I don’t ever wanna work it out.” It’s in these candid moments that the album shines and takes on a devastating universal quality.  revisits the center of those pain points that take Samia back to the times when she didn’t like herself. On sweet crooner “Pink Balloon,” she reflects on a past relationship with a tender self-awareness, having broken “a promise that I didn’t even know I made.” On  lush, acoustic-driven final track “Dream Song” Samia muses, “When I finally forgive myself/ I’ll be tired and sunburnt.” The  -produced “Mad At Me” is a bustling indie rager, its drilling dance beat and despairing chorus cathartic within its unabashed release of pent-up energy. The overall effect is like the gradual process in which flowers unfold their petals and finally bloom when given proper care. Instead of burying the old aches, Samia chooses to look upwards and shed their weight. Uplifting reflections punctuate   as well, exemplified through bright, bouncy acoustic instrumentation. The title track “Honey” has a feel-good, plucky production and a hopeful crescendo, while the electro-tinged “Amelia” buds with anticipation and glimpses of trippy sunsets and earth-shaking nights spent bonding with friends. Samia’s vocals zip up and down the beat and her range carries the track to its thrilling peak.

Fermont, in particular, has spent over 20 years traveling across Africa and Asia to document these often unknown scenes. In Iran, his research led him to Soheil Soheili, a key figure in the Teheran experimental scene.  , the platform he created in 2019, is an important informational and administrative research tool that helps artists and disseminate their music, be it through releases or events, while bridging the gaps between academic and DIY practice in experimental music. He uses “noise” to describe artists whose work includes techniques such as field recordings, sound collage, electroacoustic composition, and other forms of intense sonic manipulation. The label has released several albums by artists such as   and  , together with seasonal compilations. In summer 2022, things changed with the protests against the local theocracy sparked by   at the hands of the police. For Soheili, one of the platform’s major goals has always been to support “women’s rights and [to fight] negative social phenomenon, taken from weighty terms like fascism, or supporting feminism without it putting into words.” When the protests erupted, the idea of a compilation came naturally. “We made our minds to try our most civilized attempt to express ourselves by breaking the silence instead of experiencing darkness and isolation,” Soheili says. Despite the emotional duress and frequent Internet blackouts over the last few months, Fremont dug through his archives, using material he had previously received for other projects—such as Ehsan Saboohi’s series  —along with live excerpts and new contributions (duo Silo Portem created one hour of new music spread across the four volumes of  ).

A founder member of Norwegian improvisers   and an in-demand sound engineer with his fingerprints on a good proportion of the Rune Grammofon back catalog, Sten started recording under the name Deathprod back in 1991 and has continued intermittently since. Sten calls his approach to sound an “audio virus.” As well as being the name of his recording studio in Oslo, it’s his terminology for Deathprod’s distinctive recording set-up: a jerry-rigged web of electronic devices—primarily analog, customized, and/or obsolete—which he chains together to create a sound that is sparse and minimal, but carefully plotted and pitted with cavernous depths.  explores this approach with a steely focus. Listening to its 17 tracks, numbered in order of their creation, brings to mind mental images of industrial spaces or mechanical processes—the visceral throb of a generator, the shrill scrape of metal on metal, the rumble of gigantic objects in a state of gradual motion. It can be intense, as on “Composition 3”—a procession of corroded electronic groans that crash in relentlessly, like waves against a shore. Other times,   adopts a ghostly drift that recalls an album like Nurse With Wound’s autonomic ambient masterpiece, 1998’s  . Both albums share a sense that the humans have departed, and the perverse web of musical equipment they have left behind is working to its own infernal logic. This push and pull between intention and chance, composition and improvisation, is perhaps the secret ingredient that gives Deathprod’s music its sense of eerie charge. It’s a quality that was present on 2021’s  , a collection of exploratory tracks that Sten made using custom-built acoustic instruments designed by the late composer  , which he loaned from the Cologne-based new music ensemble Ensemble Musikfabrik. This link to compositional practice in Deathprod’s work feels increasingly clear. Yes, the timbres of a track like “Composition 6”—a slow progression of metallic scree and eerie, bell-like resonances—is not a million miles removed from those employed by a generation of bedroom noisemakers. But Sten’s assertion that these tracks are “compositions”—with all the baggage that implies—feels legit. As abrasive as it can be,   feel carefully plotted, with moments of deliberate silence and a sense of progression. It’s not hard to imagine these tracks being notated, then handed off to be interpolated through the wheeze of a pump organ or sung by a choir. Not necessary, of course. Three decades on from Deathprod’s inception, Sten is still refining and focusing his sound.   feels like a distillation of his approach, the audio virus in its purest, most transmissible form.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

For their next act, Rose fashioned themselves a fame-crazed automaton with empty eyes and plastic skin on an absurdist   journey to total failure on 2020’s ill-fated conceptual pop record  . (Ill-fated because, you know, 2020; the record itself was quite good.) Yet   shone brightest when Rose went from superficial to super-real, dropping themselves into the terrifying moment when the main-character-of-their-own-life becomes cognizant of how much has been lost in the quest to follow their heart—and how desperately they wish to hit reset on it all. Alas! No do overs in this world. What now? The “now” is what Rose grapples with on  , an unflinching chronicle of a dark night of the soul with all the swelling violas and Spanish guitars and flickering harps such high drama deserves, crammed through a purview so small and personal it could fit neatly inside a jewelry box. The record has something of a storyline the way life sometimes has a storyline—a terrible break up, a season passed in the swamp of self-doubt—but Rose is not playing a character, for once. This is them, these are their feelings and this is what they are: rejection, regret, desperation, and sadness. Far from being a drag,   is revelatory. As a songwriter, Rose has never been better; as an arranger, doubly so. In contrast to   slick synthetic textures,   splits the difference between experimental, modular sounds and manipulated analog flourishes that convey the unreliable qualities of memory, alternately mutating, degrading, or coming into heartbreakingly sharp focus, looping back and forth on itself in an endless cycle in search of an exit. The result is a record that feels constructed to mimic the uncomfortable feelings of rumination that accompany periods of deep personal growth. Rose is fearless in their expression. On “Miami,” they wrestle with the pain of rejection over frantic instrumentation that escalates like a panic attack until Rose is nearly wailing the chorus. “This is the hard part/ The part that they don’t tell you about,” they sing, their voice growing hoarser with each word. “There is the art of loving/ This is the art of forgetting how.” On the shimmery, slinky “The Kiss,” Rose attempts to soothe their shattered heart with the kiss from someone new and plasticine ’80s pop—“I would do most anything,” they whimper, their tone as downcast as it is desperate. Throughout   Rose mines their own memories for bits of comfort both cold and common sense—their mother tells them to stop victimizing themself; there’s a song about their therapist (“Jill Says”). In an inspired artistic choice, interspersed between the songs are clips of voicemails left for Rose by their grandmother, Mee Maw, who showers them with message after message of unconditional adoration: I miss you, I love you, I am always thinking about you—a potent reminder that there are kinds of love that remain constant even if the mind itself deteriorates. Do things improve for our intrepid Rose? Sort of. Not really. No. Well? Maybe. By the time Rose arrives at the closing track “Where Do I Go From Here?” they’re still at war with their conscience over the inability to let go of things they cannot change. “Take all this pain and learn to love yourself again,” sings the angel of Rose’s better nature. “Shut up,” is the reply to this pointless platitude. Some things are too painful to ever be forgotten, but they   be transmuted. “The memories live on in this song,” concludes Rose. Amen to that.", "genre": ["Pop"]}

Featuring the work of six band members, the 10 songs here are woven together in psychedelic layers. More than once I had the realization that a track wouldn’t have sounded out of place at Woodstock, the ecstatic guitar reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix and his pioneering recording techniques. And what’s more punk than Hendrix, lighting his guitar on fire or protesting the Vietnam War with his take on “The Star-Spangled Banner”? The intro offers a case in point: a haunting blip with monk-like chanting and cryptic, looping backwards audio, which dovetails sharply into the jagged post-punk of “Venom.” The trippy, repetitive “Five and Dime Conjurers” calls for slow headbanging, while “Eyes Only for Space” finds The Drin once again dipping a toe into dub. The leisurely drumbeat has a sort of squiggly industrial sound to it, and a subtle clinking sounds like a whisper of a cowbell. Kudos must also be given to the sequence of the tracks here. “Peaceful, Easy, Feeling” is a faultless follow-up to “Eyes Only for Space,” with its clubby feel and gunshot drum bursts. At times, Dylan McCartney’s vocals bear a sonic resemblance to  ’s Karl Hyde. Similarly, “Stonewallin’” and “Walk So Far” are a perfect match, and the strongest tracks on this record. “Stonewallin” is a rambling rock song, with whammied guitar wobbles and layers of airy instrumentation and muffled vocals. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it is infectious all the same. “Walk So Far” is likewise full of energy, with a proto-punk feel: distorted, coolly delivered vocals and a propulsive rhythm section. A flutelike synth wafts in the background. On “Go Your Way Alone,” McCartney seems to channel Jim Morrison, with dramatic spoken vocals set against a spectral, meandering core. That psych vibe returns again on the long-running closing track, packed with droning harmonics and an ecstatic beat. The Drin has been blurring the lines of spaced-out experimentation and gritty post-punk since their start back in 2020; here, they seem to have settled into a more cohesive groove. Some of the best favorite contemporary punk music is made by folks who, though steeped in the   (members have also played in   and  , among other bands), go in wholly new directions with their sound.

{"album": "Anarchist Gospel", "artist": "Sunny War", "description": "On  , Nashville guitarist, singer, and songwriter Sydney Lyndella Ward—also known as Sunny War—navigates a binary as old as Black American music itself. In an effort to stamp out the rich cultural reservoirs from which African people drew strength and identity, African music and traditional religion were effectively banned on plantations throughout the United States. Africans were allowed to attend church, smuggling the expressive power of their religion and music into the church behind the facade of Christianity. Thus, the Black church became the sole refuge where enslaved Africans could cut loose from the daily cycle of surveillance and punishment that stifled every other aspect of their lives. This cruel dynamic created a divide between the sacred and the spiritual where none had existed before. With its thematic dance between good and evil and its stylistic mixture of gospel with the blues, country, and rock n’ roll,   embodies all of this history. The album’s opener, “Love’s Death Bed,” tackles love and loss as Ward speaks directly to a lover who she promises will be her “last heartbreak.” We listen in as their relationship dissolves as the beautiful chorus “On love’s death bed, I lay my bouquet of flowers / On love’s death bed, I cry away our final hours.” drives the final nail into the coffin. “No Reason” is a treatise on human duality wrapped up in an upbeat country-rock tune. Over a popping groove and swooning background vocals, Ward describes a person who struggles to reconcile the best and worst aspects of their character. It’s a brilliantly executed song. “I Got No Fight” is a fantastic example of weariness as an emotional and thematic device commonly used in both the blues and gospel music. When Ward sings “Been up all night waiting for day to come. I want it over long before it’s done”, she embodies the feeling of weariness in the blues: A deep, unshakable emotional fatigue that comes from being Black in an anti-black world. Beautifully played and full of Ward’s moving vocal performances (check her gorgeous cover of Dionne Farris’ “Hopeless”),  is a stellar work of art. By reconciling the emotional, political, and spiritual dichotomies that have characterized so much Black music, Ward shows us that wholeness is possible.", "genre": ["Folk"]}

Since making their full-length   in 2013, the Chicago trio haven’t been shy about injecting humor into their raucous, high-energy brand of metal. With a motto that reads “get high. fuck. destroy.” under their official band logo, Oozing Wound’s references to drugs, spaceships, annoying circumstances, and annoying people give the impression that theirs isn’t exactly the most thoughtful music ever made. The catch, however, is that Oozing Wound are actually making fun of their own irreverence. If their astute recreations of thrash metal tropes on previous albums verged on parody, the band’s fifth album,   sees them reaching new heights on a number of levels. Once again, frontman/guitarist Zack Weil brings a touch of punk attitude to his piercing heavy metal shriek—if Nuclear Assault frontman John Connelly had channeled the snarl of, say, Johnny Rotten or Jello Biafra, he would’ve sounded a lot like Weil. But Weil isn’t just walking us through his shitty moods, petty irritations, and stoner fantasies. On “Bank Account Anxiety,” underneath the adolescent ennui of lines like “It’s all work, all work/ it makes me really upset/ Now my rent’s rising / and I eat bullshit for food,” one gets a sense of, well,   anxiety, rising along with the cost of living. And on “Total Existence Failure” Weil hints at a profound existential discomfort roiling at the heart of lines like “I’m the king of cultural waste/ on a franchised throne/ All across space/ that binds the world.” Where it wasn’t previously clear how much Weil, bassist Kevin Cribbin, and drummer Kyle Reynolds actually loved old   and   as much as they were taking the piss,   erases those ambiguities. This time around, Oozing Wound draw from a well of noise influences, a shift that opens their sound up to a breathtaking range of contours and moods. Fans of groups across the noise spectrum— ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , etc., etc.—can all expect to resonate with elements of these songs. Apparently, while Oozing Wound were spending the last decade mimicking their ‘80s metal influences, they were also developing as composers in their own right. Never has their feel for dynamics and pacing been so apparent as it is on  , which flows seamlessly from start to finish. By the time the band barrels its way into “Old Sludge” (which is not actually a sludge tune), the John Zorn-esque shards of abrasion from  /  saxophonist Bruce Lamont fit right in—just one of many indications on a ferociously creative album by a band broadening its horizons in convincing, decisive fashion.", "genre": ["Punk"]}
{"album": "Eye Of I", "artist": "James Brandon Lewis", "description": "At its core, the improvisational dance that occurs between jazz musicians during a performance is a conversation. This rich and spontaneous act of communication is the beating heart that animates  , the newest album from tenor saxophonist, James Brandon Lewis and his trio consisting of Chris Hoffman on cello and drummer Max Jaffe. The album opens with “Foreground,” a brief, head-bopping intro that pulls listeners into its swinging groove before dissipating. It’s the first curveball in an album full of unexpected occurrences. With “Someday We’ll All Be Free,” the trio take on Donny Hathaway’s uplifting 1973 R&B classic. With lyrics written by his friend, Edward Ulysses Howard, the song’s heartfelt message of perseverance was intended to be a comfort for Hathaway who was struggling with his declining mental health. In the hands of Lewis and the trio, “Someday We’ll All Be Free” is transformed into a slow-moving march whose emotional tone hangs somewhere between mournful and reluctant optimism. Jaffe’s drumming here is particularly expressive, providing both rhythmic propulsion and sonic color, while Lewis wrings every bit of ache and joy out of Hathaway’s melody From here the band slides into “The Blues Still Blossoms,” a slow, tune brimming with emotional depth. As the piece opens, Lewis states the main melody, before Hoffman echoes the statement and the two respond and play off one another with patience and grace. “Middle Ground” and the album’s title track “Eye Of I” push the energy up to dramatic extremes. On both tracks, Hoffman’s distorted cello cuts through the flurry of sound conjured by Jaffe and Lewis as the band reaches punk-like heights of volume and intensity. On “Eye Of I,” the trio’s ability to listen, improvise and respond even in the midst of such a hellacious flurry is impressive. The music here sounds brutal and abstract, but not arbitrary. Throughout its 44-minute run time,   makes a case that the communicative nature that has defined jazz remains strong among our best young players.

Their meticulous sound design practice is an influence from their late partner  , whose handcrafted waveforms and avoidance of sampling left an early impression on Manji. On  , Manji’s debut album, they recycle shards of cullet from various club and rave genres to craft iridescent pop amalgamations that deftly explore the connections between human, machine, and the environment Often inspired by nature—and its anthropogenic destruction—Manji nevertheless eschews field recording, instead synthesizing what sounds like cyborg birdsong to tint their emotional soundscapes with a post-apocalyptic hue. “Oil/Too Much” is a prime example of this tendency, a song inspired by the environmental devastation that accompanies crude oil extraction. Opening with clicks and chirps that flit from ear to ear, the track shifts into a two-step elegy from the perspective of the Earth. “You’re burning my insides/ For a world that’s hurting me too much,” they sing during the chorus, accompanied by vaporous trance synths. “Eyes/Not Enough,” on the other hand, was created in response to the wildfires that devastated Greece in 2021. “I wish the tears could stop the fires/ But there are not enough eyes to cry,” they sing, interrupted by a cacophony of computer-generated noises and gabber-esque kicks put through a slew of filters. At other points, Manji’s use of granular synthesis imbues the project with a cybernetic cohesion, from the glitched-out noise in “Pitch Black” to the misty vocal grains that eddy around “Closer to Midnight.” The conflation of human and machine that is implied in the construction of their music might be an articulation of what Legacy Russell calls “ ,” in which “liberation can be found within the fissures between gender, technology, and the body.” Lead single “Body/Prison” explores that idea: “A hologram of lies is trying to own me and I can’t escape/ A body that’s not mine and I can’t escape,” they sing, lamenting a certain projection of gender identity as an airy trance progression floats unfettered by percussion. Manji seems to transcend the shackles of the body by conducting these computer-assisted experiments in sound. With  , Manji set out to ask “what elements of ourselves might be for endurance, and what might just be decoration,” per the liner notes. While the effervescent electronics that adorn the album may seem inessential, for Manji it’s perhaps precisely within these sounds, unbound by the strictures of melody and rhythm, that they find survival.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

The album opens with “Dark Symphony,” an experimental pop track in a minor key that gradually gives way to dense, colorful synths. That track’s hints of pop and dance emerge more fully on “Begin Again,” a sweet, ‘80s-style ballad with syrupy synths and lyrics about following your own path. Layers of electronics give the intense “Breakdown” a strange, underwater depth. It takes its time building up, but a little patience is rewarded in its final form: a full-blown dancefloor banger. Drums and hi-hats enter one by one as the song reaches its crescendo with Sky singing “We were in love.” “The Moon” and “Like A Wave” are sultry, siren-like songs; the former a feisty conversation with a chameleonic lover. And “Bottom of the Sea” plays like a sister song to “Breakdown,” another cathartic dancefloor number on which Sky’s voice is at its finest—playful, nostalgic, sultry, and sweet to the ear.   is a fantasy world, and its songs sweep you up in its rich atmospheres.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

Upon relocating to Bratislava, Mede drew on these experiences to craft  , a thrilling collage of Eastern European folk music, field recordings, and experimental electronica. The album’s themes of reunion and renewal are apparent from track one, “Háromszorra Jövök Össze” (Hungarian for “I come together in three parts”). Soothing insect chirps recorded at Mede’s parents’ house form the background for digitally treated vocals a la  . Then, Mede reads a poem in Hungarian, each line of which is repeated by her sister. Suddenly, everything drops away except for a beautiful a cappella harmony made up of Mede’s layered vocals, the power of her voice expressing the peace she has found in home, family, and self-expression. Mede enlisted UK electronic musicians   and   to co-produce on  , lending many of its songs a cutting-edge sheen. For instance, “Spolu,” a collaboration with Dialect, is reminiscent of early   with its pitch-shifting of Mede’s vocals to unnaturally high and low registers and its off-kilter, bass-driven beat. That these techniques sit comfortably within Mede’s folk influences is testimony to her compositional instincts. “Interlude II” features a clean recording of the dancing of Slovak-Hungarian folk group Ifjú Szívek which sounds just as natural chopped and edited among ghostly processed voices on “Interlude III.” Mede’s voice itself is influenced by Hungarian folk singer  , especially on tracks that leave her vocals untreated, like “Sloboda” and “Gyöngyvirág.” Though she is early in her career, Mede’s musical journey has been a long one. After distancing herself from local folk traditions to immerse herself in electronic production, she has returned to her first cultural touchstones as the foundation for her work. As Mede  , “When I was younger I rebelled against folk music.

Gradually, Katherine Paul’s voice begins to surface: first as a series of wordless murmurs, then as the verse that acts as a statement of purpose for her third full-length album as  . “I know you’re watching me, I know it’s hard to meet you,” she sings. She’s addressing her ancestors, the Coast Salish people native to the Pacific Northwest. Multi-tracked harmonies overlap and blend, slowly building to a stunning crescendo that sounds like  going full post-rock. Overdriven lead guitars bend and swoop through the haze, propelled by echoing tom drums. While Paul’s prior work has always been intense, it has never sounded quite so vast. Soon after the release of 2019’s acclaimed  , Paul moved from Portland back to her homeland, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community in Washington.   recounts the emotional highs and lows of the experience, incorporating the people, landmarks, and language that comprise her home. Paul’s own parents make a guest appearance on the extended coda of “Spaces,” her own voice blending seamlessly into her mother’s as her father’s resounds strongly in the distance. “Sčičudᶻ (a narrow place),” named for a forest path by the Salish Sea, reflects on the intense connection Paul feels to her natural surroundings, communicating directly with the trail itself. “You know there’s not a part of me that’s not there. I feel it every time I walk through you,” she sings during the track’s weightless introduction, propped up solely by dreamy, fingerpicked guitar. Like many other songs on the record, it follows a linear structure, transitioning from a hummed melody to an impressionist verse and, finally, to an instrumental jam that plays out like a cathartic reaction to the rumination that precedes it.

{"album": "Raven", "artist": "Kelela", "description": "It takes a village to create a   album. With previous releases  (2015) and   (2017), the enigmatic artist has incorporated collaboration into every step of her creative process. Peruse through the liner notes of each album and you’ll often find multiple co-writers and producers credited per track—everyone from stadium-pop introvert   of  to avant-garde behemoth . For her latest LP  , Kelela expands her circle of confidants with a stellar guest list including , , , , and . But this collectivist spirit has evolved into a commitment to building community,   becoming a space through which to honor and amplify Black voices, queer love, and disenfranchised ancestors long owed their due. Raven is far less preoccupied with form than its predecessors. Songs bleed into one another and walls of synth textures transmute into waves—at times crashing violently, at others trickling in faint, enveloping murmurs. Water is a recurring motif across the album, a mirror for the ebb and flow of emotion stirring within. Raven’s striking monochrome cover shows a face emerging from water, echoing the immersive sensory loop of bookend tracks “Washed Away” and “Far Away,” which encourage repeated, increasingly deeper dives. Kelela’s principle is also one of organic sculpture, blunting and rounding techno’s jagged edges in the throbbing back-to-back of “Raven” and “Bruises.” Rigid beat structures bend to her will with ease, delivering a swift reminder that even today’s most artificial electronic genres were once rooted in soulful, undeniably human music crafted by Black producers in Chicago and Detroit. Though the storytelling across   treads familiar territory of love, lust, and heartbreak, each song feels like an individual case study of the privilege—or lack there of—inherent in sensual touch and emotional availability. “I’m reading all the writings on the wall/ And if you don’t run away/ Could be a happy ending after all,” she sings on Jersey club–tinged single “Happy Ending,” fatigued by chasing after an ideal that lives only in her head. The chase continues in “On The Run,” where she pleads with a paramour to “open up, babe,” calling the bluff of a guarded heart over minimalist Afrobeats. “Contact” is simultaneously the prime example of longing and joy on  , as Kelela buzzes from the lingering adrenaline of a night on the dance floor. It’s not the tunes that set her hips ablaze, but the potential for physicality; unspoken fulfillment of a primal hunger that burns in her belly. Kelela suggests that throwing ass and falling in love are universal constants, but the touch of lips on your skin is never more precious than right now.", "genre": ["Electronic", "R&B"]}
{"album": "All in Good Time", "artist": "Blues Lawyer", "description": "“Shaking with a cigarette, I feel fifteen again,” sings Rob I. Miller on “Someone Else,” a nervous yet disarmingly upbeat song off  ’s latest  . From the song’s  -esque tone to the snarling guitar solo during the bridge, “Someone Else” serves as a microcosm for the rest of the record, a great jangly pop album that finds its footing in the small, melancholic moments that appear between big feelings. As soon as you put the record on, it’s clear that this record springs to life through its lyrics. The album’s opener “Chance Encounter” commemorates a partner’s old haunts (“that restaurant that let us eat for free”) and all the ways to show you still love someone, aware of how those things can be both bittersweet and wonderful. While the history of grown-up guitar pop bands attempting to turn teenage emotions into something transcendent is long and varied, it’s in the little details where Blues Lawyer carve out a confident niche in well-trodden territory. “Return Policy” picks up where “Someone Else” leaves off, drummer/vocalist Elyse Schrock demanding to be taken back to where their partner first found them over steady, fuzzed-out guitar riffs. It’s a sharp, sticky song that recalls the best of ’90s power pop but excels due to its finer qualities, notably how each chord progression in the verse is punctuated with a quick hit of guitar harmonics. There’s also the chorus, awkwardly lurching forward before being smoothed over by Schrock’s harmonies. Blues Lawyer bring personality to a familiar framework by not allowing for much space between every small heartbreak and disappointment. Each pensive moment is given exactly enough time to breathe before the band moves on. The straightforward, genuine nature of songs like “I Won’t” or “Nowhere to Go” is only emphasized by their conciseness. Miller’s wistful vocals make the latter one of   most wrenching songs, while on “Understood,” Ellen Matthews steals the whole tune with a 15-second guitar solo. Much of   chronicles the more bummer aspects of adult life––from uncertainty in relationships (“Second Chance”) to terrible wages (“Salary”) with lived-in conviction––but its the band’s optimism that proves most memorable. “Scenic Route,” with its mechanical floor tom–oriented drum beat and charmingly simple melody, is a weary smile of a song. Like the best moments on  , the highlight is the earnestness: “I can’t wait until we can talk about the future we’re about to share.”", "genre": ["Rock", "indie pop"]}

{"album": "Kaibou Zukan", "artist": "99LETTERS", "description": "Takahiro Kinoshita has long warped familiar sounds into new forms. As  , the Osaka electronic artist initially tinkered within chiptune in the early 2010s, turning 8-bit melodies usually associated with fuzzy nostalgia into a constricting force by pairing them with blown-out beats. He carried a similar mindset into his more house-inspired offerings later in the decade, adding a heaviness and unease to club-ready cuts on albums such as 2015’s  . On his new album  , Kinoshita turns his experimental instincts towards traditional Japanese music, sampling and distorting ancient instruments into songs both reflective and rapturous. This shift in sonic palette is surprising, as Kinoshita has long avoided any elements seeping into his work that could be construed as “Japanese” owing to a general distaste for the country’s music. Being stuck at home—both literally and within his birth nation’s borders—forced him to re-evaluate traditional sounds.  isn’t an audio museum piece though; rather, Kinoshita samples, processes, and re-arranges noises created by traditional instruments like the   and   into new building blocks. He’s turning Japan’s past into something to experiment with while letting their traditional beauty bleed through. Kinoshita’s approach allows the songs on  to take many forms, while avoiding the stereotypical trappings music incorporating traditional Japanese sounds often hits on. From these new musical moldings Kinoshita constructs ambient glows (“Mirai”), sparse loops turned unnerving via small touches of noise (“Magoraga”) and claustrophobic drones (“Wagakki Orchestra #2”). The album’s most exhilarating moments come when Kinoshita picks up the pace. “Shishimai” sets   twangs and   notes over an industrial rhythm, with Kinoshita’s samples rippling on top of it. “Saisenbako” provides the closest track to being club ready thanks to a shuffling, up-tempo beat, while still being stitched together from traditional sounds. mutates traditional Japanese instruments into unrecognizable forms, but when Kinoshita allows their original tone to come through—such as on the drone swelter of “Shibun Goretsu” and the sparse   meditation “Koto Wo Narasu”—the familiar sounds add grace to his compositions. Kinoshita’s shift towards his country’s past mirrors similar efforts from compatriots   and   among others, who want to see how traditional sounds fit in the modern world. Whereas they respectively conjure up nostalgia for times now lost or reimagine   singing for an arcade, Kinoshita focuses on altering the sound’s DNA itself and building something new from it, without losing the essence.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Nina wastes no time flexing her well-honed pen game, artfully alluding to the first track’s title “Lougie,” by rhyming and alliterating her way around it: “Skip to my lougie/ Spit it and roll me a doobie/ If life a movie mine a indie/ Make you woozy/ Shit is a doozy/ I’m dizzy who gone pursue me/ You something to me truly/ You manage to move me.” The start to the album is striking in its urgency, pushing listeners to anticipate what’s coming next. In “Weeping Waltz,” an open snare beat with a flavor of ballroom boom bap displays the paradox that comes with how it’s “been hard to tell who to tell what I go through.” There’s a somber quality to the ascending electronic blips as the song showcases the depth of emotions inherent to life. Thematically, the refrain of “Weeping while I waltz” underscores the mourning that is central to the album’s theme. The theme of grief comes back with “Sorrel Sip,” co-produced with   (fka Jon Bap): “Sit with my sorrow, drinking some sorrel/ Deep in a quarrel had me a quarter.” Nina ensures that there’s a balance to the exploration of grief by one-upping herself bar for bar.

But the tornado is made of fire, the meteors have started a band, and the avalanche is bellowing at you in a made-up language. Drumming mastermind Tatsuya Yoshida of radical art/noise duo   founded Koenjihyakkei in early ‘90s Tokyo. Ever since, they’ve been among the premier practitioners of  , the utterly singular blend of prog, jazz, and Wagnerian opera that originated in the early ‘70s by French freaks   and eventually  . The band’s third album   came barreling into being in 2001, and was tweaked in 2009 with overdubs by the latest lineup. Now a newly revisited   has been remixed, remastered, re-sequenced, and given its first-ever vinyl version. What emerges is a beast that bears the original release’s blend of maniacal precision and brute force but adds some new mojo all its own. With Yoshida as its fulcrum and only constant, Koenjihyakkei has always taken the first-gen vision of zeuhl—a genre synonymous with visceral power—and intensified it a thousandfold into an unrelenting assault on the senses. While   doesn’t quite bear the demonic, sulfur-infused vibe of vintage Magma, it quadruples down on the knuckle-busting, prog/fusion side of things. From the breakneck frenzy of “Lussesoggi Zomn” and “Vissqguell” to the knotty, Zappa-like twists and turns of “Vallczeremdoss” and the merciless slam of “Maschtervoz” and “Gassitrumm,” the band executes death-defying riffs and time changes with such intensity, it’s a wonder the players survived the sessions. As their spellcheck-immune song titles attest, Koenjihyakkei emulates Magma by singing in a self-invented language, frequently in strident, sinister choral arrangements that make it sound like a phalanx of Valkyries on winged serpents descending from the sky. In between all the punishing rhythms and dizzying riffs, the band sometimes switches things up by adding some wild avant-jazz progressions, but nowhere on   will you encounter anything like a respite from the sonic carnage. The remastering makes it seem like the whole album has gone from black and white to blazing, retina-searing Technicolor, and the remix goes far beyond topping off the treble or bulking up the bottom end. It brings in elements that were completely absent before, like the foreboding guitar riffs on the title track’s chaotic coda or the vocals leading into the cataclysmic climax of “Gassttrumm.” If that’s not enough, we get live 2020 bonus versions of three tracks, which add a whole new perspective. The live take on “Nivraym,” for instance, shifts the focus from keyboards to angry guitar and expands things considerably with a spacy, almost Gong-like middle section. Like the rest of Koenjihyakkei’s catalog,  isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s got a lot to offer zeuhl zealots and anyone else with a taste for extremes. Even those who’ve internalized the album’s earlier versions may find this go-round to be something of a revelation.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "Memoirs of Hi-Tech Jazz", "artist": "Waajeed", "description": "Even before the release of   2022 was already shaping up as  ’s watershed year. For over two decades, the producer/DJ born Robert O’Bryant has been among Detroit beat music’s stalwarts, creating tracks and initiating the inherent links between the city’s hip-hop and dance music, a community connector of rare social and artistic dimension. This year, Waajeed’s role in  ’s crew and the group   received proper historical context in  , Dan Charnas’ wonderful biography of the late hip-hop legend; and he helped open  , a community-minded, music production school, alongside compatriots from the Detroit scene. Waajeed, who was himself expertly mentored (by some of the best, including Dilla’s guide  , and Mad Mike Banks of Underground Resistance/UR), is very much invested in simultaneously looking backwards and forwards. So it makes perfect sense that from its title on,  , his first full-length since 2018, reflects what’s already gone down and previews potential futures.  spotlights not only Waajeed’s story but the alliances within a Black musical tradition often segregated by genre-minded separatists and its role in local cultural history. “Hi-Tech Jazz” was a hugely influential early ‘00s track by Galaxy 2 Galaxy, a “group” within the fabled (and deeply political) UR crew; it affirmed techno’s relationship to the improvised nature of dance music while nodding to the city’s own specific electronic tradition (“hi-tech soul” was originally one of Derrick May’s nomenclature alternatives for the music which came to be known as “techno”). Waajeed makes these connections explicit.   is bathed in horns and strings, driven by well-placed narratives and unexpected contributors (local rapper Black Nix and  , senior pastor at San Francisco’s Church of John Coltrane). It’s personal and communal, a call to arms and a product of joy, the beautiful creation of Black Detroit through and through. Sonically, the title tells no lies:   is basically a classic Detroit techno album replete with jazz textures, many of them courtesy of  , whose myriad credits extend from UR to  ’s group, and who’s become central to the city’s current evolution. (De’Sean is also all over   compilation, which is in some ways a sibling to  .) Jones’ sax and EWI, as well as his string arrangements, are featured on nearly every track, instantly expanding the palette of 808s and 909s that are Waajeed’s primary weapons. And these horns—often including Frank Alowishus’ trumpet and Khristian Foreman’s trombone—are not here to simply solo over open beatscapes, as is the deep house norm. When they’re not woven deeply into the fabric of these dance tracks, syncopating alongside the percussion lines or sequenced synths, the horns affirm and recontextualize Waajeed’s wistful melodies (long a hallmark of his productions), bringing the music into a new space. “The Ballad of Robert O’Bryant,” for instance, moves from the sounds of documentary crime scenes into electronic marching band music, beautiful horn lines evocative of mid-’70s soul flirting with layers of drum machines. The first single “Motor City Madness” opens with minimalist jacking, evoking the city’s classic “hi-tech” sound; but not a minute in, trombone and sax asides (individual, but often in harmony) begin appearing in the crevices. Soon the horns syncopate into formation, and by the end, a wonderful theme appears, and a classic is born. The closing “Remember” opens with meditative piano chords and mid-tempo 808 handclaps before a line of Jones’ harmonizing horns ushers it into wonderfully redemptive jazz-house territory.   is a stunning journey, surely familiar to any listener or dancer who knows how Detroit has helped reshape global rhythm, yet also fresh with possibility. Waajeed knows the lineage; now, he’s very much part of it.", "genre": ["Electronic", "techno"]}

{"album": "Mirrored", "artist": "Vanessa Wagner", "description": "French classical pianist   first explored minimalism in 2016 with the release of  , a collaborative record with producer   that matched her intimate interpretations with electronics. It planted the seed for her next records, showing how Wagner’s meticulous yet fluid technique can unlock deep feelings: 2019’s   and March 2022’s   both emphasize a sense of poignancy and reflection. Her latest release  continues along the same path, but this time, Wagner showcases her flexibility, effortlessly bouncing between fast-paced rhythms and serene contemplation to illustrate the potent emotions hidden within the simplest of melodies. While all the pieces Wagner plays on   can be categorized as minimalist, they each come to the style from a different lens.  ’s and  ’ works highlight an early generation of Western minimalist composers, while Camille Pépin, whose impressionistic works branch out of the 20th century American avant-garde, represents the current trajectory.  s work draws inspiration from electronic music and composers like John Cage, bridging styles and disciplines. While each piece offers a slightly different perspective, Wagner seamlessly pairs them, emphasizing the subtlest changes in tone. Throughout, Wagner’s nuanced playing creates a delicate flow. During Glass’ rumbling “Étude No. 4,” she powerfully strokes each note, letting her tempo ebb and flow with the motion of the music. Glass’ lamenting “Étude No. 2” comes next, and Wagner changes over to rounded, elongated tones, creating a sense of deep rumination. But it’s Pepin’s “Number 1” that best showcases Wagner’s flexibility: At first, she strikes her piano with a thunderous rhythm, gradually lightening up with each pulse of a heart-wrenching melody. In just a few minutes, she changes again, playing airy, twinkly pitches with a gentle touch, and by the end, she reaches a state of buoyancy, energetically leaping between each note, only to fade back down to a sense of moody reflection. The final two pieces on  , Melaine Dalibert’s “Six + Six” and  ’s “Mineral,” both conjure a sense of radiant meditation, finding a moment of solace after the vigor of earlier tracks like Pepin’s. Here, Wagner’s playing is at its most delicate and vulnerable, letting each note ring with a mix of wistfulness and dreaminess, leaving us in a state of gentle reverie that echoes long after the notes have finished. It’s a fitting way to end the record, one final reminder that simplicity doesn’t have to be surface-level—it can cut right to the heart.", "genre": ["Classical", "contemporary classical"]}
{"album": "Atalaya", "artist": "Dezron Douglas", "description": "On  , the latest full-length from Dezron Douglas, the bassist and bandleader is supported by an ensemble of gifted players:   on piano and keys; Joe Dyson Jr.  on drums; and Emilio Modeste on saxophones. The result is a fresh set of songs that are beautifully played and teeming with life. The album opens with the sound of a lone clave before the full band kicks in for the title track. Douglas, Burton, and Dyson build a solid rhythmic foundation so that Modeste can fly on tenor. The band eases the tempo for “Rosé,” a lovely ballad where Burton’s piano chords play nicely against Douglas’ warm, round tone, setting the stage for a melodic, exploratory solo from Modeste. Burton’s solo on “Rosé” is inventive, with long, winding melodic lines that flow into rich chords and clusters. Toward the end of “Rosé,” the quartet rises to a climax, shedding the understated feel of the opening section and playing together with fire and intensity. “Coyoacån” kicks the tempo back up, with the band locking in and improvising at a furious pace. Douglas’ playing on the tune is particularly exciting, seamlessly flowing between solid, walking basslines and daring free playing. Burton’s piano and Dyson’s thunderous drumming create an open, abstract space before the band reconvenes for the song’s soaring main melody. “Jones Beach” opens slowly and intentionally with Dyson’s cymbals and Modeste’s melodic lines conjuring a grand, regal atmosphere from the tune. “More Coffee Please” finds Douglas laying down a nimble, head-bopping bassline as Dyson swings alongside him with staccato chords from Burton. Modeste’s solo is playful and evocative and, as they do on much of the album, the band strikes a balance between bop and free playing. Part of   strength lies in the fact that it offers an exciting set of new interpretations of the jazz tradition.

Musically, the band build on a lineage of mischievous, eclectic post-punk typified by bands such as  , the Minutemen, and  , yet they set themselves apart through their unexpected melodic zigzags, playful instrumentation, and disparate genre influences. Opener “Foot Control” and its earworm of a bass riff introduce the listener to their sound, retro enough to be familiar yet just off-kilter enough to keep things fresh. Dissonant guitar shrapnel, mirrored in the lyrics about “a wild ride losing control,” keeps things interesting. On the anthemic, hard-rocking “Pensar,” drummer Pipe Morelli declares, “I don’t feel like reading sad poems tonight.” Whether it’s a witty takedown of indie pretension, a life-affirming declaration of happiness, or both, it’s a lyric that encapsulates Dumb’s musical approach. Other highlights find the band stepping beyond the building blocks of their sound to incorporate a wide-ranging array of influences, from ska to hardcore to folk. “Dropout” features a trumpet accompaniment that matches the song’s snarky, world-weary wordplay, and “Gibberish” evolves from a spikey, punkish piece to a beautiful, haunting outro. “Strange is the Morning” is sweet and melancholy with hints of creeping unease, and “30 Degrees,” with sing-along verses and delightful vocal harmonies giving way to an anxious lyrical paranoia, further develops the band’s sense of musical tension and exploration.   is a grab-bag of delights, from sour to sugary sweet.", "genre": ["Rock", "indie rock"]}

One friend who saw them said it reminded them of grindcore, an oddly understandable comparison for how these short songs feel spring-loaded with intricate rhythms, shifting time signatures, and exuberant solos—all qualities captured quite well on  ’ title track. But while  gained a kaleidoscopic flair from its different players and sessions, this album focuses on one band across 18 bracing songs and feels equally rewarding. It allows new and returning contributors to explore exciting interplay, such as pedal steel guitarist Eric Kinny and saxophonist Johannes Eimermacher, whose solos beautifully overlap on closer “Clues Not To Read.” Recorded live in a single night,   captures the momentum of those live performances while feeling like a strong example of Phillips’ “open session rock” recording philosophy. The album also builds even more on the compositional partnership between Phillips and Clément, whose strength for creating impossibly complex arrangements and powerful, heart-stirring melodies complement each other wonderfully. Clément’s nimble, dynamic vocals lead songs like “Save the Phenomenon,” “Days of Pleasure,” and “4000 Rooms” that carry lovely hooks while rippling with almost fractal-like layers of rhythms and harmonies. Other highlights like the atmospheric “Boîte à Serpents,” “Porn of Love,” and “Constantly Rare” demonstrate that same balance at a slower pace and fit into the ebb and flow of the album’s live recording. In one of the album’s few, well-placed skits—taken from old, dubbed films in a move that surprisingly recalls Wu-Tang Clan—a swordsman and a poet reflect on their envy for one another’s paths. Fievel Is Glauque, meanwhile, never feel the need to choose between beautiful poetry and technical chops in their multi-faceted music. They happily carry both on  , while walking a line that feels as thrilling as a tightrope.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Here, “ABC” stands for Ahvagene Bond Clarke, Lee’s grandmother and a university-trained pianist with perfect pitch.   features 19 recordings, some of them 40 years old, of Clarke’s grandmother playing and singing popular songs, mostly from the mid-20th century. These recordings are casual and homemade; listening to them feels more like looking through a stranger’s old photos than listening to an album. Listening to  , however, feels like doing both of those things at the same time. It’s the first full-length project from Clarke, a Philadelphia-based producer who previously released a promising   in 2020. He followed that with a series of singles featuring collaborations with fellow Philly artists   and  , which showcased Clarke’s knack for richly constructed beats. On  , he uses samples of his music, as well as of Ahvagene and her sisters singing, talking, and playing piano, to create a set of compelling beats that feel hyper-personal, especially with the   compilation as context. Clarke’s tracks pack a punch in a short amount of time. “Can’t Sleep” is 70 seconds of glowing tones set to an arrhythmic beat that sounds like   unbuckled in the back of a moving box truck. Opener “Dwight Likes Jazz” is barely over a minute long, but its combo of subaquatic dub and a fluttering horn line sets an ultra-cool tone for the rest of the tape. The longer tracks are no less effective. “One More” is Clarke in quiet-storm mode, using breathy sampled vocals and liquid string sounds to build an alien R&B jam; twinkling piano and brushed drums make “Two Chords” the jazziest song on the album; and “This Life In Space” uses its nearly four-minute lifespan to evolve from a melancholy vibe to a woozy, weird dance-floor banger and back again. It’s a short sonic journey that neatly summarizes one of Clarke’s strengths as a producer: He’s a wandering spirit who never gets lost in his own sauce. Occasionally, Ahvagene Clarke’s voice emerges from her grandson’s gentle river of sound to drop a little wisdom or tell a funny story. “By that time, there were so many of us who played the piano,” she says in “Morphing Gene,” a murky mid-album interlude, “That our piano was going from morning till night.” It’s moments like these that make   feel like a threadbare peek into Lee Clarke’s existence—a lasting reminder of life’s impermanence and the enduring impact of love.", "genre": ["Electronic", "beat tape"]}

But that wasn’t the conversation at the time. No one praised his creativity as “Duchampian”— . Instead, he was marginalized as a   troll; at best, clever at marketing ploys. All performative stunts must be treated equally, right? It’s 2022. What do we make of Drake and 21 Savage’s sham   cover? Surely, there are more flags on the field besides a   from Condé Nast. Why is one provocative and the other desperate? The gatekeepers of art are still in Shirt’s crosshairs on . Over the baroque strings of “Marni Invisibility Cloak,” he’s not rapping so much as thinking out loud: “Many artists are not easily pigeonholed as being only one thing.” Later, on “Death to Wall Art,” Shirt confronts the status quo, the supposed “revolutions” being treated as art movements: “Don’t show me a corny NFT of a shark/ Go   with sharks/ Kill a shark.” Welcome to the woodshed, where Shirt works out his frustrations with art and art-making. The album is built on the poet and professor  ; essentially, all great writing is behind us, so our only choice is to recontextualize what already exists.

His first words on the song—and the album—are, “The ones willing to kill everyone/ Is the ones in charge” before admonishing that Chappelle’s jokes “…put people in danger/ The dummies think it’s funny/ I think you should be more careful who you make comfy.” Explaining the album’s concept feels flagrantly academic, if not the antithesis of rap music.

Of course, the Chappelle commentary—like his Duchampian plagiarism of Caramanica—won’t be met with universal applause, and not everyone will be tweeting how Shirt is brave for speaking truth to power.

A teenager records a cluster of songs, bent over his guitar in the attic of his parents’ home. The teenager lives in Hebden Bridge, a small town just west of Leeds caught in a moment of transition. It’s not yet become   and the hippies; it is, however, in the throes of industrial decline following the closure of Acre Mill, the local asbestos processing factory. The economic pains are immediate, but the human toll comes into focus more slowly. In 1976, a public advocate   that 12% of 2,200 former employees suffer from debilitating asbestos-related diseases. Someone paints “ ” on the side of the shuttered brick building. Demolition orders eventually follow, and by the end of 1979, all that’s left is an empty lot. The teenager’s songs disappear too. But that all comes later. Suspended in this peculiar in-between moment of the early 1970s is Trevor Beales, the latest entry in the long folk tradition of being discovered decades late and with nary a Google result to their name. Responsible for this discovery is  , a small contemporary folk label based in nearby Todmorden.   is the label’s first release by a non-working songwriter, and it is, at its best, remarkable. Although you’d never know his age from the world-weary character of his voice, this is the work of a young songwriter seeking a musical identity by trying out several. He begins with dark and detailed narratives. Album opener “Marion Belle” is an evocative tale of mariners adrift upon the waves and within their own hearts; “Tell Me Now” is a harrowing one about a farmer’s son accused of raping and murdering the mayor’s daughter. His assumed guilt is rooted in the class divide: “Such a girl of respect would never have let/ A mere farmer make love to and court her.” “Sunlight on the Table” is the opposite of a narrative, however, which is to say it’s a song in which nothing happens. Beales fixates instead on the minutiae of a single, interior moment: “Silence in the corridors, a slow tide in my mind/ A mist made up of memories of the ones I left behind.” A talented player by any standard, he attempts a playful Latin experiment on the instrumental “Braziliana.” But the energized album finale “Fireside Stories” may be the standout. He hits every impassioned downstrum with fervor and combines sharpened, singular stanzas—“If your jewels make you sparkle/ And your wine makes you glow/ And my words taste so bitter/ And you’ve learned all there is to know”—with a catalog of momentary images marked by a sensory vividness. It’s easy to imagine him, pen in hand, noting down the “creaking rocking chair and thick velvet curtains and the smell of the pinewood walls.” As such,   captures a gifted and otherwise-forgotten songwriter in amber.

They just don’t make ‘em like they used to, it seems, and they certainly don’t commission Italian composers for ‘em.

{"album": "Everything Returns", "artist": "Black Ox Orkestar", "description": "Montréal post-everything quartet   has always dealt in a sort of cultural timelessness. Thierry Amar (bass), Scott Gilmore (cimbalom, piano, vocals), Gabriel Levine (clarinet, guitar, vocals), and Jessica Moss (violin, vocals) first got together at the turn of the century to create what they refer to as modern Jewish diasporic folk music, with lyrics mostly in Yiddish. Listening to 2004’s revelatory debut  , and the equally fantastic 2006 follow-up  , it’s easy to imagine them popping up in history as a jazz band or a Balkan folk outfit, a Yiddish theater troupe, or participants in the North American   of the ’70s and ’80s. By melding these disparate threads of the Jewish diaspora together, and applying a fresh coat of post-punk polish, the band arrives at a hauntingly beautiful sound. , Black Ox Orkestar’s new album, marks their first full-length since 2006, and only their second recording since returning from a 15-year hiatus. While the name of the album is a reference to the idea that so much of the past is here again—its liner notes address the refugee crisis and re-emergence of fascism around the world—this is also certainly a bit of a tongue-in-cheek comment about the band reuniting. While there have been   contextualizing the history and culture of Judaism within DIY music—examples include  ,  , and many of the artists on John Zorn’s Tzadik Records, from   to Deveykus—what Black Ox Orkestar is doing has always felt very unique, and  is no exception. This is Jewish music,   (a term that roughly translates as “Jewishness”), presented in a way that can be enjoyed both by those with strong connections to the community and those from outside it. There’s a good reason that the band’s first release since reuniting was a 7-inch flexi that went out to subscribers of the magazine  , which describes itself as “committed to the rich tradition of thought, activism, and culture of the Jewish left.” That being said, a knowledge of Judaism isn’t necessary to be able to appreciate what Black Ox is doing, though everyone would benefit from reading the extensive liner notes. Lyrically, Black Ox draws on universal themes of exile, anti-fascism, and the intricacies of identity. Radical politics have also played an outsized role in their message and mission.   touches on topics including war, immigration, generational trauma, and popular uprisings across the globe, sometimes all in the same song. For example, in “Mizrakh Mi Ma’arav,” the band parallels the deportation of Jews during the Holocaust to concentration camps in the East with the plight of Syrians desperately trying to flee that country’s ongoing civil war to the West. As the narrator of the song shifts from one to the other, so does the language the band is singing in, as well as the music itself. The result is a kind of mosaic, juxtaposing notes and words from across Europe and the Middle East in a heady whirlwind of Yiddish and Arabic,   clarinet, and a violin that would sound just as much at home on a  . Even if you don’t understand Yiddish (or Hebrew, Arabic, French, and English, the other languages on the record) it’s clear just from listening to these songs that so much of this album is a celebration of continued existence. It might sound melancholy at times but really so is life. The overall tone, the spirit of the music, it’s one of hope for a better tomorrow. The final two tracks are a perfect example of that: a Moldovan  , a type of Jewish folk dance, is followed up by “Lamed-Vovnik a cabaret-like jazz tune about the Jewish legend of the   who keep the world in order and how we are always one misstep away from destruction.

On the newly reissued  , the Charallave, Venezuela-raised bandleader falls in and out of love with a new woman every time the trombones start up again. And if the four girls in hot pants lounging on its cover were not sufficient proof, then listen to the man himself. In a recent interview shared by El Palmas, the Barcelona label responsible for the reissue: “I dedicated [the album] to women because one always has the tendency to do things for them.” Indeed one does. And one suspects that Urbina is the most lethal of seducers, one who — to borrow from (bear with me) the  sequel — “genuinely falls in love every evening, only to fall out of it again the next morning.” As such, Moncho y Su Banda’s salsa is passionate and deliciously brassy but light on its feet. Sharpened by years on the Venezuelan club circuit, the band is tight as can be, but loosened up by the sambuca that allegedly flowed during studio sessions. Case in point: the rhapsodic piano interlude on album opener “Olvidame,” the harmony tossed over to the trombones at just the right moment. And true to its genre and its historical moment, it’s shot through with sweeping emotion. The specific juxtaposition of musical liveliness with lyrics expressing desperation, devastation, and the like is analogous to the 20th century Latin American experience — carrying on, not unpleasantly, amidst an unstable sociopolitical climate. Venezuela of the ‘60s and ‘70s was no exception, still reeling from the Marcos Pérez Jiménez-led military dictatorship and flush with the cash and corruption that inevitably accompany sitting atop enormous oil reserves. Salsa responded in kind, sometimes politically.  ’s dramatic emotional and music shifts, however, are almost exclusively directed toward the fairer sex.

Her dexterity is on full display in album opener “Summer,” a song built from cascading piano trills and sung from the perspective of a little girl whose mother has died—“There’s photos on the wall/ Without them, I wouldn’t remember you at all”—leaving her father bereft.

Her muse for “Malevolence” is the imp of the perverse, and its hypomanic major key cheeriness borders on abrasive. “Wrong” is about an extramarital affair and one of several songs addressing a profound loss and a psychological crisis of not-insignificant magnitude: “There’s no right/ There’s no wrong/ There’s only the way it was going to be.” Maybe so. The aftermath, the wreckage, the leftovers, the tinge of memory, the dust-covered surface—that’s what Marlody is most interested in here. She regrets certain things, stacking her vocals and repeating “I’m so sorry now” and “I don’t want to be this way” on “Words.” She is largely disinterested in any real resolutions or lessons to be drawn, let alone learned from. She doesn’t know  . Maybe she never intends to find out  . It says so right there on the cover. Her emotional desolation has a poetic quality, as does her languishing in the ambiguity of it all.

Yeah, it’s a bloody, vulnerable mess, but it’s real, it’s still beating, and there’s the will to keep moving. Building on her last full-length, 2018’s  , and her work in the part punk, part multimedia performance band, Evil Sword, she continues reveling in the subterranean study of lo-fi sounds. Her music, which sways between curious synth explorations and folk-tinged punk, has little in the way of polish; instead, her fascination lies in the dings and scrapes of each song’s imperfection, further underlining the mental clutter she carries with her. Ferencz’s work thrives on the brutal, naked honesty found in life’s sorrowful monotony. I need that magic now,” she pleads in the opening track “Can You Heal Me.” “I don’t know if I’ve ever been this sad.” Her lyrics are odds with the whimsical nature of the music; what seems playful and nostalgic at first is soon blackened by grief. The whirr and hum of her songs create a detachment, a muddiness: “Take Me Away” is built upon a chaotic loop of filtered nebulous noise, while “She Stopped Making Art” is a faded and distorted lullaby reserved solely for nightmares. But there’s bravery in Ferencz’s delivery. Like the 1980s no-wave debutante  , Ferencz’s dry and unapologetic vocals trip over her clunky emotional baggage, but she always manages to land on her feet. “I’m A Monster,” in all its controlled pandemonium, emphasizes Ferencz’s ability to shove together abstract elements such as sample loops, erratic synthesizer lines, and bellowing, mangled sounds as the undercurrent for her voice’s disorienting mise-en-scene: I might be doing worse than I let on.” The grungy gunk of “Hate Your Car” feels like a tantrum in all its weighty fuzz. Conversely, “Violence” operates under the guise of lightheartedness with its adolescent polyphonic music box tune. By juxtaposing the lyrics’ sobering truths with the music’s childlike fragility, Ferencz introduces an uncanny element to her otherwise straightforward confessionals, a subversive twist that consistently pays off. Noted as “some kind of catharsis” by Ferencz herself,   grapples with the stinging bitterness of existence—”The world is going to hell,” she admits on “She Stopped Making Art.” It is the real-time suffering of an individual shown through a blurry analog screen. But the purgative artistic process bears a sprig of hope near the end, and by “The Holidays,” she is finally ready to receive and to give love again. “Everyday I try to do some normal stuff,” she sings. “Almost anything is better than just giving up.” The acceptance of her mistakes, the modesty with which she admits them, the flawed, beautiful soundscapes surrounding them: it all adds up to something truly admirable.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

But the   isn’t so easy to lump in with the still-working Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller orchestras. Among other things: How much was Ra (who “departed” in 1993) ever really of this world anyway? The Arkestra is now under the leadership of  —98 years old and a band member since the ‘50s—who understands that Ra is not a ghost but a spirit. His message of interstellar utopia requires the music to live and breathe, to reach out to new and receptive audiences rather than tickling the nostalgia bone. Hence for   the Arkestra’s second studio recording since 1998, Allen himself adds to the repertory. Three of the album’s seven tracks are his original compositions. Each one, however, channels the spirit of Sun Ra as surely as the master’s own tunes do. The title of “Marshall’s Groove” suggests some sort of signature piece for Allen. Instead, it’s exactly the kind of slow, psychedelic meditation that Ra specialized in circa 1960: equal parts drone, bebop, blues, and Afro-soul, with the dueling tenors of Nasir P. Dickerson and Chris Hemingway buffeted by riffs both gentle and urgent from trumpeters Michael Ray and Cecil Brooks; French hornist Vincent Chancey; and violinist Tara Middleton as the music slowly reaches a boiling point. His ballad “Firefly,” too, is mindful of Ra’s apprenticeship in the swing bands—it puts Allen’s own shrieking sax (plus solo lines by Chancey and trombonist Adriene G. Davis) against a luxuriant slow-dance backdrop. Then again, Allen and the band keep the vintage set pieces fresh, too. The leader assays Ra’s “Somebody Else’s Idea” with an electronic valve instrument (EVI), adding an appropriately otherworldly voice to the texture, and pours charm all over the Disney tune “Wish Upon a Star,” a favorite of Ra’s, again supplementing the lushness with his coarse alto tone. Then there’s the Allen-Ra diptych that gives the album its name. Allen’s composition “Day of the Living Sky” is ostensibly a response to Ra’s “Night of the Living Sky” (“Day” preceding “Night”) here, but it has a hypnotic life of its own, with Middleton’s searching, gorgeous flute blazing a trail across a sea of brass fills and Allen’s startling  . Response or not, it’s an elegant complement for “Night,” which here gets a subtle percussive lift from low brass and the thoughtful interplay of hand percussionists Ron McBee, Jorge Silva, and Elson Nascimento. It’s a masterful touch, completely changing the feel of the composition in a flavor that Ra would no doubt have approved. That’s the real secret of  ’s success: Even as the listener misses the legendary bandleader’s presence, the music completely retains its potency without him because his psychic energy is everywhere. Sun Ra’s ghost doesn’t haunt the Arkestra, but his spirit vivifies it.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

On   Sierra Leonean DJ and producer   explores a different set of priorities for his electronic compositions. Throughout the album, Fofana creates subtle, ambient compositions that are tools for meditating on climate change and the ecological destruction capitalism has wrought. Dynamic and texturally rich,   is electronic music that articulates both the complexity of the natural world and our pernicious relationship to it. The album opens with “Tune Of Departure,” a lovely, minute-long overture that sets the tone and introduces listeners to the world of sound that   conjures. Clocking in at nearly 12 minutes of running time, “A Symbol of the Withdraw God Redux” is a vast, foreboding work of sound. The repeated central motif casts a foreboding dark over the piece, while synth pads provide a counterbalance of light. “Erosion / Whispers ‘a laminated shout’” is a drifting, understated track that feels like the slow, inevitable movement of time. Beneath the primary drone that guides the tune, more subtle percussive elements emerge to provide a faint suggestion of rhythm. “Broken Time Of Transition” is a brief melodic piece built around a lone, staccato kick drum. The drum’s thump acts as a heartbeat or an anchor for the bird song–like melody. In less than two minutes, “Broken Time Of Transition” gives way to “Rehearsal Of Truth,” a dreamy synth and vocal piece that is drenched in static. The album’s closer “Oily (Resurfacing)” is a lowkey techno track that pushes the album’s sound into a more overtly rhythmic, danceable territory. Given the album’s heavy subject matter, perhaps there is some significance in ending the album on such an upbeat note. Although there are no words to articulate this sentiment, there is a hint of optimism to be heard within the driving beats on “Oily (Resurfacing),” assuring listeners that the dance of life will continue despite human destructiveness.", "genre": []}

If that sounds familiar to fans of  , the sci-fi thrashers that Cobbett co-led with Yob’s Mike Scheidt, that’s entirely fair. Cobbett wrote the bulk of  without a specific band in mind, and at times, the material seems to split the difference between Hammers and VHÖL. On the Hammers side, there’s the insistent warble of mellotron and organ, split between Cobbett and Sigrid Sheie. On the VHÖL side, there’s the reckless, hurtling tempos and the rhythmically diabolical riffage. Cobbett has said that he envisioned  as a combination of Sadus and Genesis. That’s truly bonkers, but the band makes it work. The Scalzi-featuring “Dark Brennius” and lead single “Don’t Follow the Lights” prove instructive in understanding what Cobbett and his collaborators are doing here. Both open with beautifully played clean guitar passages, not so distant from the proggy AOR balladry of past Hammers songs like “Summer Tears” and “Here Comes the Sky.” Both, too, are soon split open like John Hurt in  , their chests caved in by dexterous thrash riffs and battering drums.

DJ  ’s “Skanking Apologist” is practically straight-up hard house. And the first third of  ’s “Klaplong Sun” boasts the searing major melodies and donka-donka 6/8 kickdrums of hardstyle. It’s all way more mega-rave than aloof hipster. And yet, and yet… Nothing on   is a straight rehash of existing templates. “DTMemory” has a roll and throb to its rhythms that hints at an acquaintance with early dubstep. The vocal cutup “Skanking Apologist” is camp, punky, and androgynous. And “Klaplong Sun,” after its relatively conventional start, heads into a wonderfully bizarre meltdown of psychedelic digital processing, as if the walls and floor of the rave are disintegrating around you, leaving you in the abyss of space. After that? Anything goes. All the styles of hard dance are represented here—gabber, donk, you name it—but the traditional macho pitched-down voices, or breathy “sexy” female ones are replaced with ambiguous or outright   vocal processing. As the album goes on, those regular kickdrum patterns are interspersed with other, freakier rhythms: breakcore, trap,  ’s gravity-rearranging, rubberized, double-time techno-bass, VAMPI x RATTLESNAKKE’s terrifyingly tactile snaking of slo-mo R&B…and on and on it goes. There is a lot of this that’s experimental in the literal sense; i.e., trying out things you’ve never have heard before. And there is clearly intellectual and political intent behind it all—the comp is  , and the album notes make it very clear that this is about protest and transgression—about smashing boundaries, not dismantling them. There are, after all, tracks called “cunt laser hypnosis” and “punk motherfucker,” the latter of which interpolates Sham 69’s chanted aggro-punk “If the Kids are United.” Noise, distortion, and relentless momentum is the name of the game. This is music for illegal raves, for squats and makeshift venues, for parties where you don’t so much question your identity as completely forget who and what you are within an hour. It’s cleansing and filthy all at once, it’s ecstatic and psychedelic to the thousandth power, it’s got so little time for discussions of aesthetics and authenticity that you can almost feel it laughing in your face if you try to pick apart what means what. It’s a joy just to know it exists.

Days before Jackson was shot dead in the yard of the maximum security facility, he completed the manuscript for  , a fierce and incisive collection of essays that laid out Jackson’s sweeping vision for a socialist revolution here in America and throughout the world. Taking its name from Jackson’s final masterwork,  is the debut album from Baltimore improvising ensemble Konjur Collective. Composed of Show Azar on synthesizer, Jamal Moore on alto sax, trombone, electronics, and percussion; and Bashi Rose on drums, Konjur Collective manages to create a sound that is dense, textured, and intense. Fittingly, the album opens with “George Jackson”, a 21-minute epic in which Rose’s rolling, polyrhythmic patterns propel Moore and Azar forward as the trio locks into several explosive grooves. At around the 15-minute mark, Moore plays a riff that will relentlessly hold down the rhythmic center of the tune for the next five minutes, allowing Rose and Azar to play furiously around it. “Ancestral Dialectic” opens with the sound of a lone monophonic synth sliding its way through an ominous, 4-note motif. From here, Rose enters with a slapping drum pattern. The hot, crunchy texture of Rose’s drum sound brings a weight and edge that would rival the dustiest sampled breakbeats. “Spirit Realm” presents a significant change of pace from the head-nodding rhythm of “Ancestral Dialectic” with a foreboding, world-weary tone. Rose’s toms, kick, and hi-hat work develops subtly, while Moore and Azar transport us to another realm. It’s hard to quantify or describe sufficiently, but there is something within/about “Spirit Realm” that feels ancient and reverential like an offering sent over to the other side. “Jonathan Jackson” is not only named after George’s younger brother (who was also killed by corrections officers), the intensity of the trio’s performance captures the fiery essence of the younger Jackson. Forward-thinking but not precious, free but not haphazard,   pulls its power and creative energy from a long tradition of Black radical praxis. Theirs is a free and courageous approach to music that embodies the revolutionary spirit that Jackson and countless other insurrectionists throughout the ages have lived and died by.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

After a long hiatus, Ederra returns with  —a warm set of love letters to her family, lovers, inner-child, and Ethiopian culture. On  Ederra finds herself in flux, and the theme of transition acts as an anchor for the album. The melody of the title track centers on a twirling acoustic guitar and yearning lyrics that explore the idea of living life at the precipice of change. Its title is apt: Orange is the intermediary color between red and yellow, and fall is the intermediary season between summer and winter. Lines like “Twinged with gold,” “hearts grew yellow with love,” and “faces remembered from heaven” offer measured notes about sadness and yearning. The song sets the stage for an album that’s concerned with the feeling of growth into adulthood and the changes that accompany it. Dreamy, ethereal vocals are Ederra’s signature, and she delivers each note with clarity and assuredness. On lead single “Portals,” she weaves a tale of unrequited love between electric guitar harmonies and stripped-back riffs. The sense of longing is tinged with angst, as she sings, “I dream about you all the time/ I wish I didn’t/ But I see your face/ When I close my eyes,” marking a realization that her feelings have transitioned from friendship to “more than just a friend.” Filled with uncertainty, Ederra shows how bittersweet transitions can be. Something special happens near the end of “Steel Wing,” a song that pays homage to Ederra’s father and his journey as a refugee (a topic also tenderly written about in “Yellow Cabi”). Ederra uses the song as a cross-generational conversation, comparing the challenging journey that came before her and the path of freedom she pursues. It starts with a driving hi-hat and arpeggiated guitar chords, strummed together until the song slides into lover’s rock reggae.

On album-opener “Ready to Run,” NNAMDÏ is feeling isolated and restless after achieving his career goals: “I fought my way in for a seat by the throne,” he sings, his smooth vocals dusted with light electronic manipulation. “I’d trade it all for somewhere to come/ When both my feet get heavy.” That sentiment is echoed on “I Don’t Wanna Be Famous,” where NNAMDÏ sings: “I don’t really wanna be famous/ I just want a million blue faces,” a line that highlights the positive experiences that have come from his rising popularity while lamenting the pressures of being in the public eye (“I don’t really wanna be ogled at”).  also looks at more universal experiences. “I got all dressed up/ Just to be stood up,” he sings on “Benched,” which punctuates a vulnerable narrative of unrequited love with anthemic guitar lines.

Like the dual nature of the Greek goddess Capricorn, the album’s tracks provide a backdrop for TSHA’s exploration of the state of her personal relationships and her visions for the future. The record can be divided into two parts, the first of which features TSHA alongside collaborators like Clementine Douglas,  , Malian griot vocalist  , and TSHA’s partner, Mafro.

On  ’s eighth solo album   that feature has been honored as a key part of the title. Fittingly, the album is written in the present, but anchored in the past, as if the MC is flitting between two worlds without ever breaking the musical spell. Snippets of archived radio interviews and commercials—lifted from mixtapes that Eagle made back in the late ’90s, while listening to hip-hop shows on Chicago college station WHPK—bolster the nostalgia. The fuzzy shorts bring a collage-like quality to the album, acting as prompts that inspire autobiographical songs that detail Eagle’s relocation to Los Angeles (“Crenshaw And Homeland”) and pay homage to a rich lineage of Chicago MCs (“79th and Stony Island”). The album’s guest list further builds on the mixtape concept, adding a collegial feel that’s epitomized by the rousing closing cut “CD Only Bonus Track,” where golden era producer-on-the-mic Diamond D joins forces with lyrical trickster  . (The song also includes a reference to the once-coveted yellow Sony sports Walkman.)

But then comes the realization: “I memorized your lyrics and seen every interview/ I look into the eyes of the piece: He ain’t really you.” The line is a nod to the rumors that DOOM would send masked imposters to perform on his behalf at live shows, but it serves another purpose in the song; it allows Eagle to blur together sepia-toned memories with cold reality in a way that sums up the album’s main theme: Nostalgia is mostly what we want to make it.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}

As a gay Black musician who struggled through poverty and long bouts of homelessness, Eastman was firmly disconnected from the social and economic class privileges that many experimental musicians enjoy. Despite this, Eastman and the music that he created were connected to something much greater. With their hypnotic rhythms; harmonic and melodic inventiveness; and a deep sense of spirit, Eastman’s compositions demand acknowledgment as part of a rich and old tradition of Black experimental music.

Anchoring the piece, the synths are subtle, patient, and evocative, wringing every bit of emotion out of the piece. “Choose To Be Gay (Femenine)” is built are billowing synth pads and James’ voice.  “Enfield, Always” ups the tempo, opening with a tight four-on-the-floor kick drum and bright, plucky synths. Here, the similarities between James’ and Eastman’s styles meet beautifully across the gulf of time and space. Both masters at constructing relentless rhythms, Eastman’s and James’ respective musical pulses occupy “Enfield, Always,” resulting in a driving, hypnotizing track. “Black Excellence (Stay On It)” offers another take on Eastman’s original piec, “Stay On It.” With its sweeping synth arpeggios, “Black Excellence (Stay On It)” twists, contorts and eventually builds to a furious climax before settling into a ghostly closing section. With  , James provides a fresh new context for Eastman’s work. These compositions are not covered as much as they are completely reframed as James adds the emotional elements of contemporary soul music and the textural characteristic of electronic music to Eastman’s minimalist classical works. Full of intriguing sound design and compositional ideas, James gifts listeners with a new way of hearing Eastman’s work. As tragic as it is that Eastman died in relative obscurity, perhaps works like this can act as a small consolation.

Later that year, she released  , a collaboration with sound artist   consisting of blown-out melodies built from tiny phrases. Where those albums often worked with complementary patterns,   makes intricate music out of striking contrasts. It’s an evolution for Fratti, one that explores the push-and-pull between consonance and dissonance to tell a story of personal transformation. The album derives its dark, raw sound from the instruments that swirl around Fratti’s fervent cello and feathery voice: synth, guitar, and bass from Héctor Tosta; synth and tapes loops from  ; violins from  ; drums from  ; and sax from  . Fratti’s lyrics, which glide above the instruments, speak of the desire to change—to become something that’s still just out of reach. Her music mimics those themes in its search for balance, the way it teeters between moments of chaos and warmth. Most of the tracks build from an oscillating melody or bass line, then branch out by adding new textures on top. The backbone might be as straightforward as the syncopated, deep plucking that runs through “Desde el cielo,” or as invigorating as the bristling cello tones and electronics on “Con Esfuerzo.” While each element ultimately gels, there are moments when the music disintegrates into tense uncertainty—“Cada Músculo,” for example, changes from a buoyant pop track into an apprehensive instrumental. But the song’s layers never come undone, a testament to Fratti’s careful attention to detail. Penultimate track, “Deja de empujar” feels like a culmination of Fratti’s interests in contrast: It’s a finely woven tapestry that hangs by a thread, yet somehow still holds together. Fratti’s voice slips between the arpeggiating saxophone, gliding cello, and retro synth buzzes. Her lyrics are turbulent, too, asking: “¿ ” (“What is my body asking for?/ Stop pushing”). The music is off-balance, but it feels direct, reliably finding its footing amidst the mayhem. By the end of the album, Fratti has found a sense of contentment. There are a few static pulses and a few eerie twinkles on “Siempre tocas algo,” but Fratti’s voice—accompanied by bright cello harmonics and resonant electronics—emerges to take over, charting a course out of turmoil and into the light. Fratti’s work has always reflected her expertise in crafting gently layered, thoughtful music.

{"album": "Njyhi", "artist": "Nok Cultural Ensemble", "description": "In addition to the physical, psychological, political, and economic anguish and destruction that the trans-Atlantic slave trade and colonialism wreaked upon the African diaspora, these conjoined historical epochs have also made a dramatic and lasting impact on African diasporic culture. As the material summation of a people’s creative life, culture is both an indicator of where a people are and a determinant of where they might go. It is as the great Cape Verdean and Guinea-Bissauan revolutionary Amílcar Cabral once  : “Culture is simultaneously the fruit of a people’s history and a determinant of history.” As the European empires of old overran West and Central Africa, the pillaging of artifacts from ancient indigenous cultures was common.

Like much of the music throughout  , “Sang Awun” is primarily made up of percussion instruments. Despite this, the composition doesn’t lack in timbral color or in the complexity of its arrangement. As the piece’s rapid-fire snares enter and play off of the hand drums, it is evident that this is in no way limited simply because it is drum-centric. Considering the countless lives, memories and culture lost due to the historical tragedies of colonization and enslavement, there is something healing and invigorating about this music. The rhythms that Wakili-Hick and the Nok Cultural Ensemble have conjured on  are not just music for the sake of music.

The album opens with “Ani,” a groovy, breezy love song where Hakim presents love as an ongoing dialogue of shared passion and discovery. “Ani wanna feel love, glad I found her/ She opened up her heart and showed me what’s inside her.” With its crunchy drums, waves of delay, and a vicious,  -style burst of guitar noise that enters toward the end, “Ani” is also a sonically odd delight. “Happen” begins with a flourish of dreamy psychedelic organs before settling into a slow, strummed-guitar groove. Hakim delivers the song’s lyrics in a near whisper: “The sweetest angel fell into my world/ She gives me reason/…Was lost for a damn long time.” The dreamy “Vertigo” is built around a gentle guitar riff and a half-time electronic beat. Hakim’s voice is particularly dextrous here—it gets slowed down, pitched up, and layered to produce lovely stacked vocal harmonies. Like many of the songs on  , “Vertigo” occupies a sonic space between rough-hewn lo-fi rock and inventively produced soul. “Feeling Myself” combines plucky synths and a pitched-down drumbeat. The music has a chill retro-futurist feel, while the lyrics are impassioned and direct: “You got my tongue out of my mouth/ I’m addicted to loving you.” s hyper-focus on love doesn’t limit the music—it’s full of interesting stylistic fusions and soundcraft. By diving so deeply into the specifics of romantic love, Hakim imbues the songs with the degree of intimacy and detail that one of the most profound human experiences deserves.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Hypnotic Guitar of John Ondolo", "artist": "John Ondolo", "description": "While the 1980s brought a wealth of reissues of albums by African guitar luminaries like Franco,  ,  —and, later in the decade, Ali Farka Touré—to Western ears, it’s been thanks to the due diligence of collectors and labels that previously unheard gems from the continent continue surfacing at a steady clip. Fleeting glimpses of “dry” (or acoustic) player John Ondolo could be gleaned over the decades, as his “Tumshukuru Mungu” has cropped up on various African guitar compilations. But  , crucially collects 12 early sides (cut on 78 and 45rpm discs) that vanished by the early ‘60s. Though these sides were released by independent Kenyan labels, Ondolo himself hailed from Tanzania to the south. His style was noticeably different from other players of the region, favoring an open tuning that allowed for an underlying drone as Ondolo added a delirious array of figures atop. Yes, American blues also favored such tunings, but you won’t soon conflate Ondolo as an example of “African blues” (though as a devout Catholic, he too was torn between his faith and his music). Pick almost any number here and Ondolo’s style is nimble and dizzying, yet inauspicious. It might take a couple of plays before they suddenly burst into bloom. Hear that opening gurgle of notes on “Wazazi Musilie,” his strings intermingling with flute (a rarity of the era) and crackling hand percussion, and he sounds charming and hypnotizing at once, his runs bringing to mind a harp more than a six-string. Ondolo and that flutist buzz even harder on the stomping “Yunie Mpenzi We,” which sounds sing-songy—until you try to keep up with the shifting sands of its wordplay and rhythm. The beguiling “Kenya Twist” and “Kenya Style” might namecheck that country, but Ondolo’s distance from Nairobi played out in the music. He wasn’t part of the capital’s vibrant nightlife scene; instead, Ondolo was very much an outsider, never quite in step with trends. The former song features elegant lines that unfurl and constrict in unexpected ways as Ondolo’s thumb provides a steadying pulse. It’s tempting to cite another finger-picking open-tuned guitarist of the West like  , but it’s hard to imagine the master ever being as concise as this. Some of the later sides show Ondolo playing an electric guitar atop rhythms that reveal a possible influence drifting in from Congolese rhumba, the liner notes suggesting that Ondolo’s style shifted so much because of his sporadic recording history, only getting to the studio in Nairobi when he could get away from his farm nestled in the foothills of Mt. Kilimanjaro and make the pilgrimage. Soon after, Ondolo left music, taking a job driving a mobile cinema van for the Tanzanian government, until a car accident led to the loss of his left arm, silencing that exquisite guitar style forever. A decade in the making,   reveals a true East African guitar hero and proves that the music was always worth the trip.", "genre": ["Acoustic"]}
{"album": "In The Fade", "artist": "Tony Molina", "description": ", the third record from Northern California artist   since his 2013 breakthrough  is the cleanest, clearest distillation of an aesthetic the 36-year-old has continued to explore since forming his first band, Ovens, in San Francisco in the early 2000s. That aesthetic: Crafting 12-and-15-song sets that technically could fit on seven-or-ten-inch records yet, despite flying by in the amount of time it takes to make coffee in the morning, feel like full-lengths. Molina left the Gibson SG at home for elegant Beatles-and-Kinks-inspired stylings on 2016’s  , while 2019’s  was billed as a collection of unfinished material. For these reasons,  feels like  ‘s proper sequel. Bookended by a pair of airy symphonic instrumentals, the 14-song, 19-minute album brings back in full force the Thin Lizzy guitarmonies, bare-bones drumming, and half-time breakdowns on tunes like “The Last Time” and “All I’ve Known.” But the 1960s pop influence is also neatly folded in on material like “Not Worth Knowing,” “I Don’t Like That He” and especially the stately acoustic ballad “Don’t Be Far.” Not the focal point, but not an afterthought either, Molina’s lyrics are simple and relatable. Whether or not to end friendships and relationships with diminishing returns—and whether or not to move on from the exciting-yet-stressful urban environment that shaped him—are recurring themes. The Mellotron-laden “Song for Friends,” laments old buds who have “gone and changed,” presumably leaving the punk lifestyle behind for straighter suburban existences. But there are also moments where Molina wonders if he should be the one bailing, like the breakup tune “Fuck Off Now,” and “Leave This Town,” a callback to  ‘s very first line (“I have got to leave this town”). “Everything I do is not the same,” Molina declares on the album’s penultimate track “Years Ago Pt. 2,” That’s true, but a more accurate statement might be that no one else does what he does. Theoretically, hardcore punk, power pop, and psychedelia are strange bedfellows, but Molina’s reverence for each informs  ‘s combination of melodic hooks and metallic riffs, appreciation for brevity, and lack of pretension. Familiar as much of the music Molina draws on is, the specificity with which he does it—and the sense of joy—makes him a singular figure.", "genre": ["Rock"]}

Smith got her start crafting balmy soundscapes on releases like   and   which led to a collaboration with Buchla legend   on her 2016 breakout  , an album commissioned for  .’s FRKWYS series. But in recent years, Smith has explored more varied and conceptual terrain. Her 2017 record   was a 13-track interpretation of the four stages of life. May’s joint effort with composer Emilie Mosseri,   blurred the lines between ethereal synth work and percussive neo-psych. Smith’s latest,   might be her most drastic detour yet. Recorded over the course of three intense, solitary months in her home studio, it grapples with the emotional complexity that underlines this complicated socio-political moment. The end result veers away from her usual shimmering atmospheres, in favor of more propulsive and driving textures.  does have some airy moments, but, for the most part, it’s better suited to the club than the sound bath. “There Is Something” starts as a fluorescent slice of neoclassical choral music, but evolves into a muted, dancey song that sounds like it could have dropped during the heyday of UK dubstep. On “Give to the Water,” Smith manipulates her vocals into a metallic, digitized blur to create one of the record’s chirpiest cuts. And it’s hard not to hear traces of Oneohtrix Point Never’s   and   on tracks like “Then The Wind Came” and “Pivot Signal.” For an artist whose signature vibe is typically overcast and esoteric,   is united by a kind of neon-drenched futurism. Smith was raised on Orcas Island, Washington—a remote isle in the Pacific Northwest’s Puget Sound—and she’s never been quiet about the impact that this stunning and bucolic upbringing had on her early work. Over the last several years, she’s moved around quite a bit, and her newfound Los Angeles homebase seems to shape   These modernist compositions and their preoccupation with the looming realities of unnatural evolution are more evocative of Southern California’s stucco strip malls and wildfires than they are of the fog, pine trees, and blue-gray waters that surrounded Smith when she first became interested in music.

{"album": "Recordar É Viver: Antologia Vol​.​1", "artist": "Pedro Lima", "description": "In 2020, the Swiss label Bongo Joe kicked off a crucial reissue series highlighting the music emanating from the tiny West African island republics of São Tomé and Príncipe. Situated a few hundred kilometers off the coast of Gabon on the main continent, the small islands fell under Portuguese rule for centuries. The colonialists used the island to force enslaved Africans to work the plantations there. As a result, a veritable melting pot of music and culture from Africa began to mingle there. Starting with  , you could begin to hear the way that these small, vital islands cooked down the sounds of Angolan semba, Congolese soukous, Cape Verdean coladeira, and Kenyan benga, adding heavy dashes of outside sounds from Haiti, Brazil, and the West Indies. And yet the sound of these islands is irreducible. Bongo Joe soon followed that collection up with  , the thrilling 1985 album from Pedro Lima, perhaps the most crucial artist to ever emerge from São Tomé and Príncipe. When your sobriquet is “A Voz do Povo de São Tomé” (“The People’s Voice of the Island”), you know you’re at the source. But were it not for the rescue of the aging tapes in São Tomé’s radio archive, most of Lima’s exuberant, joyous music would have gone unheard. Thankfully, Bongo Joe now bless listeners with a generous and ecstatic 12-track set,  . Lima began his music career as a teen, forming his band Os Leonenses with family members in the 1960s, well before the island achieved independence from Portugal. He originally manned the tumbas, the conga-like drums, as well as the bass, before the band’s lead singer dropped out of a gig last minute. The crowd was so taken by Lima’s relaxed yet moving singing, that he was soon the frontman. But while, on the surface, Lima’s voice is all grace, don’t be fooled by his relaxed delivery: his lyrics are some of the most outspoken on the island, a truth-teller in the years leading up to the revolution and in its wake. He remained vital and beloved in his country until his passing in 2019. Lima evokes the continent’s greats: he could be as driving and endlessly melodic as Franco and T.P. OK Jazz, as expansive as King Sunny Ade, as politically outspoken and engaged as Fela Kuti, yet as smooth as Tabu Ley Rochereau. Start with “Ami Cu Manu Mu,” with its bright, ever-unfurling melodic lines and incessant puxa rhythm (a mutation of Angolan rebita) propelling things along at a clip. There’s a banquet of sounds to entice you: the back-and-forth between Lima and backing vocalists, the delirious interweaving patterns laid down by guitarists Leopoldino Silva and Pety-Zorro. It all drives a dancefloor stomper that has Lima calling out the corrupt politicians of the island while cagily shrouding it all in metaphor. And somewhere near the midway point, Lima and band suddenly hit another gear, the hi-hats pistoning and electric organ pulsing, sending everything higher into the stratosphere. “Subocha” seems to arise out of the island jungle, opening with bird calls and whistles and a percolating hand drum underneath. Slowly, the guitars emerge and entwine like plant roots. Lima’s voice glides across the tune like a cloud in the afternoon sky. Most tracks near the seven-minute mark, and almost any number here is an occasion for an outsider to hear one of Africa’s best-kept musical secrets, yet another titan hiding in plain sight.", "genre": ["World"]}
{"album": "Green of Winter", "artist": "Battle Trance", "description": "Calling a new   release a “record” feels incomplete, a grasp at a convenient shorthand. “Achievement” is probably the best word that can be used to encapsulate hearing the saxophone quartet’s remarkable ability to, like ants, construct and wield masses of sound vastly out of proportion to their bodies. A new Battle Trance record is invariably accompanied by details of the work’s grueling genesis. The group’s leader   puts the other tenor players— , Matt Nelson, and Jeremy Viner—through rehearsals that the notes for their first release,  , compare to martial arts training, while   release notes saw Laplante describe its writing phase as “the most torturous and demanding compositional experience of my life.” Their latest record,  , doesn’t shirk on this: A 19-day retreat of typically lengthy rehearsals in Vermont preceded the recording, and label   press materials make note of “Laplante’s rigorous, decade-long compositional studies with   author, W.A. Mathieu.” (Via email, Laplante says   concludes a planned trilogy of compositions for the group.) Yet, as occasionally harrowing as   is, it’s a concluding step in a 10-year journey for the group and mandatory listening for anyone with even a passing interest in hearing the boundaries of music gleefully pushed. As   moves through Laplante’s compositional roster of overtone playing, notes sung through the saxophones, and dense, rippling arpeggios, it does so with remarkable clarity and purpose. Hearing single-instrument groups at length can get tiresome, but Laplante’s very good about using the saxophone’s set of extended techniques to vary the timbres of the music. The first and longest of the three movements opens with eerie breathing and whispering sounds before the group begins singing and clicking their instruments’ keys; it’s nearly five minutes into the piece before sounds conventionally “saxophone-ish” occur. All that said,  , when compared to the band’s previous works, clocks a number of departures for the band. It’s the first—on Bandcamp at least—to list the engineering, mixing, and mastering personnel and its materials also make mention of the space in which it was recorded (Putney, Vermont’s Big Barn). Laplante has also made the work’s score   and the cumulative effect of these additions is a social widening of Battle Trance’s gyre, a new angle on a very tight-knit, insular ensemble. It’s Battle Trance’s 10th year as an ensemble, and while I don’t love the cliche of the group “maturing”—anyone putting this level of effort into composing and performing is not going to change up their sound simply due to age—  does feel like an end-statement. Laplante revisits some of the major-key ensemble sections from   and explains that “there are echoes of musical themes and feelings that purposefully exist on more than one album, kind of like hidden threads that weave them together if one listens closely.” The piece ends with all four men singing a simple melodic line while they keep up a flutter of keys, a lovely capstone for the trilogy. Of course, this could be because   was very much a pandemic project. We’ve all emerged—at least as much as that word applies to an ongoing situation—from COVID-19 as different people. But one can still draw comfort from the fury and challenge of Battle Trance: The world turns, the great sea yearns, the ants go marching on.", "genre": ["Classical", "modern jazz"]}

{"album": "First of the Brooklyn Cowgirls", "artist": "Mimi Roman", "description": "In the 1950s and early ‘60s, Mimi Roman did just about everything she could to become a successful country singer: She learned how to play the guitar; she performed in talent shows; she signed to the renowned Decca Records label and recorded tunes and toured all over the place; she even altered her name and concocted an origin story—that she grew up in small-town California, not Brooklyn, New York—she thought might appeal to country fans. Critics and radio DJs liked her clarion voice and her winning personality, but not quite enough; Roman never scored a real hit, and before she turned 30, she more or less left the industry, choosing instead to stay close to home and sing for commercials, films, and other less glamorous jobs. Roman’s striking talent and truncated career arc made her a prime candidate for an archival release, and in 2012 the reissue label Bear Family Records compiled her singles and released them as a CD called  . Now,   is digging deeper for its compilation  , which features previously unreleased demos, radio, and TV performances and recordings sourced from 78rpm acetate discs in Roman’s personal collection. As is typical for such a release, the 25 tracks on   vary in sound quality, with some sporting a layer of hiss that only adds to the historical charm of the release. And many tracks are live performances, accompanied by audience applause and preceded by an introduction, occasionally delivered by Roman herself but more often by men like Arthur Godfrey, host of his own variety show called   (1948-58). The first nine tracks of this collection focus on Roman’s appearances on the program, including a performance of “I’m The One Who Loves You” that showcases the sturdy elegance of her voice, and a version of Hank Williams’ “Weary Blues From Waitin’” that juxtaposes a baroque orchestral arrangement with yodeling. At the end of this section, Godfrey exclaims: “By golly, Mimi, you don’t come from very far West, but you sure can sing those songs.” The rest of the compilation traces Roman’s journey through old-time radio shows and military gigs, with distinctive covers of famous songs and cuts of tunes written by her husband at the time, Paul Evans. Highlights include  ’s “Rocky Road Blues” done with perfect Western swing pep, a cozy countrypolitan number (and suspected promo for Marathon Oil) called “He’s My Marathon Man” and a skeletal run through  ’s “Folsom Prison Blues.” On the traditional song “Born in East Virginia,” Roman sounds authentically Appalachian, but on “You’re the One,” she sounds like she could’ve been a Motown artist. And when you listen to her torch-song take on Floyd Tillman’s “I Gotta Have My Baby Back,” it’s very easy to imagine Roman as a  -sized figure in country music history; if only she’d caught the right breaks at the right time, she may very well have become a star. Because no matter the situation or the style of the music, her voice is powerful but approachable, and reliably vibrant.

No track on   feels like any other; “float on,” with its staggered, hollow drum beat, creates space for Iyer to slow down and summon the resilience she needs to find her light once again. And album closer “i hope i see you soon” is Iyer at her most direct, admitting that some days are harder than others. Her voice starts in a lower register, acknowledging the pressure of writing a song while holed up in her room. Not all is lost, however: Iyer is buoyed by good memories and the hope that the future contains the possibility for those times to return, her vocal tone lifting as her spirits brighten.

In February 2020, while COVID-19 was still a faraway headline in the West rather than a nightmarish actuality, Night Swimmer dropped a queasy, chillwave-tinged   with the message “dedicated to those suffering from the losses of families and those losing lives HOPE STILL REMAINS,” and then fell silent. Those intervening two years of conflict, chaos, isolation, vacillating emotional states, and a search for sanity or serenity of some kind define his long-awaited new album,  . To make it, Dengke retreated from the big city back to his hometown. Throughout, the album plays with such polarities and opposites, from the title (  can translate as “summer” or “idle,”   as “night” or “wilderness”) to the tracks themselves, which whiplash from crisp beats and tactile instrumentation to wholly synthesized realms. In almost any track, you can hear Dengke grapple with the same tumult of emotions that befell us these past few years. “Killing Time” encapsulates such extremes in under four minutes. It comes on as chilled-out and placid, with tones that shimmer like synthesized raindrops, embodying a Fourth World ambient aesthetic. It then quickens into something anxious, hectic, and nervy, like someone trying to focus on deep breathing before lapsing into a doom-scroll on their phone before realizing again that they lost track of their inhale. On the soundtrack-esque “Suspiria,” Dengke toggles between twanging strings and smooth saxophone and smeared electronics, before dropping the track into bleary-eyed, cavernous abstraction. More of that sleek saxophone drives “Night/ Field,” with Dengke this time pairing it to a slick beat for an ‘80s noir-groover. Elsewhere, Dengke recreates the ritualistic percussion of what the notes call “his hometown’s local rituals for the dead.” Through most of the album, Night Swimmer prefers the unsettled, the warped, the temporal, as if to convey that nagging sense that at any moment,   could all crumble away. Just when you think the dancefloor peak “Depressionfruit” will keep ascending, you’re plunged back into a twilit realm until the final minute. In that way it continues to emulate our post-pandemic headspace, cautiously moving forward while achingly aware it might all grind to a halt at any moment. In that way,   reflects the precarious balance of staying mindful amid a crushingly uncertain world.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

This communal spirit remains present in her transformative music productions, both on her 2016 debut EP,  , and, now, her first full-length LP,  Demone, who wrote and recorded   in Los Angeles between 2017 and 2019, states in the album notes that the music is “a call to other trans people, femmes, NB, queers, sex workers, [and] people struggling through capitalism.”  ’s nine songs exude a sense of fearlessness and provide an aural space of both safety and solace in their sweaty communal dance loops and kaleidoscope of gallant, gem-toned melodies.   was written on an ElecTribe ESX-1, and the sampler’s simplistic patterns, with tribalistic four-four beats and crisp snares, play on subtle tensions as the energy multiplies. Most of all, Demone’s vocals, which float and rise over the music, belong next to Klaus Nomi’s new wave operatic octaves or Bronski Beat’s Jimmy Somerville, who proudly vocalized his queerness to the masses in the melancholy hit, “Smalltown Boy.” But there’s little melancholy to be found on  . Instead, there’s comfort in being different—a radiating warmth inside the album’s undulating grooves. The opening song “WAKING” is an unbridled gallop, as percussion swells and synths pour over the song’s edge. The urgency of Demone’s pursuit of strength resonates louder and louder as the album progresses: “Lipstick as armor/ Earrings as shields/ Eyeliner sharper than steel/ As sharp as you feel,” her ghostly voice proclaims over the hyper-build of album standout “NO FL3SH.” With the same dynamism found in nightclub spaces, “WAV3RAV3” snatches a moment of uninhibited freedom from the constraints of the world, its percussive layers recalling the hypnotic trance of Chris & Cosey’s raw electronic escapades as Demone recalls both the tribulations and victories of those that came before her: “Ancestorial knowledge/ The past that follows/ Informs your cells from the start.“ “SPIN3” buzzes with passion, as Demone sings, “In your eyes, it’s a man with a bent mind/ Undefined by the confines of the flesh that holds us.” Though it’s barely detectable through the cascade of synth pads, the song is tinged with heartache—emotions are seen, honored, and celebrated. At its most basic,   feels like it’s derived from nature’s core elements: water’s regenerative power, the cyclic shedding of the skin. Every song delivers a transformational tool for others to follow in Demone’s wake, as she accepts the journey in order to arrive at the destination. “I’d sing to everyone,” Demone writes in the album notes. “Both on, and about to start their transition, all in their own ways.” Demone is a storyteller—a documentarian of sorts—and   is her great work.

Opener “Our Wretched Fantasy” is both euphoric and nostalgic, with Nayar’s signature guitar loops evoking a kind of dream state. “Tetramorph,” which follows, offers a sharp contrast: the song moves from drone-like ambient, punctuated by Nayar’s finger-picking, to a dark, oscillating, sinister whirl of sound. That the track ends as an acoustic Midwestern emo jam is surprising, and welcome. It’s these dualities—fantasy vs. reality, chaos vs. order—that Nayar explores in various ways throughout  .

In addition to ,  , and     of queerness in schools,   restricting trans students from participating in school sports. Most appallingly,   of these   have intended to allow   in any instances of “dispute” over a student’s sex. The idea of a “genital inspection” stems out of the common notion that a trans person’s genitalia is a public matter (questions about “the surgery” and the reveal of genitalia abound in film and television). It’s within this context that the name and spirit of Pittsburgh-based one-woman experimental black metal project   is worth considering. With her debut EP  , Erin Dawson puts forward a stunning 14 minutes of carefully crafted fury and catharsis as vibrantly hued as it is bloody, a triumphant reversal of the grim history that rests behind its name. The EP’s liner notes acknowledge   Margaret Killjoy and   Hunter Hunt-Hendrix as predecessors within the “emergent tradition of trans, queer, and nonbinary metal musicians.” If there are sonic similarities to either of those forebears, however, it’s only in small moments. Likewise goes for a bevy of other recent bedroom black metal experimentalists like  ,  ,  , and  , for instance, who Dawson manages to stand apart from as much as each does from one another. Altogether, these mutations of black metal show just how varied the once stiflingly codified genre can be and how much expressive potential remains within it to be uncovered. Within this, Dawson’s vocabulary is uniquely her own. The album opens with a snakelike guitar counterpoint over a blast beat. This soon gives way to a slower quarter-note pulse that indulges one of the project’s greatest strengths: Dawson’s exploitation of the lo-fi aesthetics characteristic of raw black metal. Acting as the sole composer, producer, and performer, she utilizes the control available to her, toying with the texture of clipping guitars and cymbals, crafting melody out of the dissonant ambiguous tingle of distorted semitones clashing against one another. Across the EP, Dawson treats her own ideas as a sort of raw material, using both steady crossfades and sudden bursts to bind her disparate thoughts and present new forms and modern myths to our ears. The last vocal line heard on this EP’s opening track “Gnostienne,” for instance, is a bestial roar that steadily dissolves into the soundscape around it. In a few quick seconds it traces a transmogrification: a human becomes a monster then expands until she dissipates into the ether, becoming particles surrounding. Forever exploding and forever transcending, it’s a whole new kind of transition with no body (and yes, no genitals) required.", "genre": ["Metal", "Black Metal"]}

From here, Livingston expands into a plea for his own emotional well-being, “You been giving me something, but I’ma need a little air/ You giving me nothing but I’ma get it somewhere I swear.” With its dreamy synths, finger snaps, and Livingston’s sweet, vulnerable vocal, “6AM” conjures an emotional space not unlike the bittersweet romanticism of  / -era Prince. The title track “Like Neptune” has a head-nodding beat and lyrics that explore sadness and impermanence. Livingston’s guitar playing is deft and subtle in this glowing, 21st-century blues. “Bend Yr Ear” is a slow, soulful cut in which Livingston makes a simple and effective proclamation of his love for his partner. “Bend Yr Ear”s musical backing is dark and understated as he walks listeners through the ecstatic heights and excruciating lows of love. “You make me laugh, you make me cry/ Your love is like the sunshine washing me clean/ Oh my my my/ If the flood comes/ Let it rain,” he says. While Livingston takes a serious, deeply expressive approach to the album’s themes and performances,   is not a dour listen. The production has some heavy that belie Livingston’s hip-hop roots while the lyrics remind listeners that the real strength to make it through life’s trials is the strength that we pull from intimacy and vulnerability.", "genre": []}

Like the three other LPs they’ve recorded since snapping a decade-long hiatus in the mid-aughts, it tastefully updates the trusty formula of their early work with glossier synths and production. The second, more experimental half of the record features some of the most interesting ideas that The Orchids have toyed with since the turn of the century. “I Should Have Thought” marries trip-hop and sophisti-pop, weaving gloomy electronic soundscapes atop shuffling drum machines. “My love feels hopeless, hopeless,” sings James Hackett, tapping into the wellspring of angst that Sarah fans are undoubtedly familiar with, though the product’s noticeably darker; steeped in more adult drama.   cover art—nocturnal, saturated, high resolution—intentionally contrasts with the lo-fi  , looking back on an idealistic past through the lens of experience. “Limitless #1 (Joy)” is the record’s best pure pop song, opening with a dreamy flourish of congas and echoing background vocals. Working around a few simple keyboard chords, the band emphasizes restraint in their songwriting, briefly introducing ephemeral fragments of melody to the mix that dissolve as quickly and one can perceive them. A trebly guitar riff, a faint pulse of synthetic brass, and a dash of melodica all make cameo appearances on the track, fleshing out its introspective atmosphere without cluttering the sound field. Even “Isn’t It Easy,” a standard indie pop tune constructed around Brighter-esque fingerpicking, feels subtly cinematic with its lovely, heaving string arrangements.

{"album": "Whipped Stream and Other Earthly Delights", "artist": "Moth Cock", "description": "If you’re curious about how moths reproduce, here’s a quick summary: First, a female moth secretes pheromones to attract a mate, who then attaches himself at her abdomen using his “claspers” (don’t ask). The male moth then delivers a “spermatophore” (a small sack containing spermatozoa and nutrients for the larvae-to-be) to the female via his aedeagus. The female moth then carries the spermatophore in her abdomen, remaining capable of mating with several more males before laying the sum total of her fertilized eggs. And that may or may not be beside the point. On  ,   deliver not a spermatophore but otherwise hefty and nutritious three-and-a-half hours of electroacoustic improvisations that frequently conjure worlds as wonderful, alien, graceless, and confounding as insect mating. This three-cassette collection compiles livestream performances by the Kent, Ohio-based duo (consisting of saxophonist Doug Gent and electronics improviser Pat Modugno) created for two separate Twitch series:   Fun One and evenings curated by Pizza Night founder  . Reminiscent in form to an hours-long Grateful Dead bootleg, the album is oriented toward the long-form jam, evoking trancelike effects through patterns and drones. The duo consistently excels, however, in going beyond the sum of their parts. Extended groove-based jams like “Invisible Pranks,” “Mineshaft Full of Caspers,” and “Sprawl Battles” exhibit the duo’s uncanny ability to change on a dime as well as present a stunning array of ideas and textures in a limited live duo format. Meanwhile, album opener “Castles Off Jersey” presents them at their most subdued: a droning introduction in which the live-processed saxophone seems to arrive from another world (perhaps benefitting from the always-somewhat-alien format of the livestream.) By combining an audibly palpable sense of humor with a predilection for exploratory sounds, Moth Cock concoct a live album like no other. As a durational work, it’s clear that much care went into sequencing and curation. Frequently, transitions from track to track seem to provide subtle jokes, and the whole album is paced with moderate peaks and valleys, allowing the ears (and vibe) to recover from its more abrasive offerings.

But his participation in  , the 2019 tribute to Jean-Michel Basquiat, provides context for his work: In that collection, Wu-Lu fit in comfortably alongside jazz, rap, and dubstep luminaries, offering a snapshot of a Black bohemian London that echoed the giddy experimentation of Basquiat’s New York at the start of the ‘80s. Wu-Lu is the product of a sprawling, diverse South London subculture, one that’s not bound by musical genre but by a commitment to keeping grassroots creativity alive in a rapidly gentrified city. His is an ethos shaped by moshpits, jungle raves, and skateparks. His kindred spirits are the Afro-diasporic collective  ; genre dissolvers like   and Micachu; and jazz warrior  ; they’re also photographers, filmmakers, and campaigners. It’s milieu where the making and the doing are the point—maybe even more than the results. It’s DIY and punk in the truest sense. And the first Wu-Lu album proper is punk as anything. It might start with the string-heavy trip-hop groove of “Take Stage,” but even   sounds pissed off, belligerent in its self-expression. Roman-Hopcroft’s half-rapped, half-spoken, “Be careful what you wish for/ It might just come true” drips with weary menace. After that comes the scratchy dub-punk disorientation of “Night Pill,” with its matter-of-fact pronouncement: “You’re a fucking mess.” From here on in,   remains moody, gritty, crunchy, and brain-warping. There’s a sinew-tightening, edge-of-panic jungle in the wiry “Facts,” and neo-soul meets doom metal in the three-and-a-half-minute epic “Calo Paste.” Its songs exist less within genres than in a deeper archetypal tradition of urban British disaffection—a lineage in which   and   tap into the same wellspring.

The result is a beautiful and hypnotic meditation on pleasure, sweetness, connection, and living one’s life to its fullest potential. Album opener “Faolintro” welcomes listeners into  universe with a sample of two un-emotive narrators, instructing: “Make certain that you’ve done whatever you need to do to create the pleasant atmosphere where we will not be disturbed during the duration of this tape recording.” The instructions are clear: This album intends to draw listeners into a purposeful listening experience; one without distraction, intrusive thoughts, or excess stimulation, much like a guided mediation. The first half of the album feels distinctly tropical, with riffs and melodies reminiscent of mid-century jazz and Brazilian bossa nova.

The album opens with “Dark Ages,” a heavy, wistful tune that lures in listeners with a delicate electric piano motif. The head-nodding beat and splashy cymbals kick the tune into overdrive as the main melody soars around the rhythm section. “Uncovering the Truth” is built around nimble-yet-forceful drumming and a lengthy sax solo that’s free as it is exploratory. The album closes with “Black Liberation,” which acts as its emotional thesis statement. DoomCannon’s piano drifts softly around a mournful bassline as Sienna Hamilton’s cries of anguish rise up then fade into the background. Doomcannon lends his voice to the track, sternly proclaiming that “The UK is not innocent,” his indictment reminding us of the role that Europe has played in the global subjugation of Black people. The tone of “Black Liberation” is subdued but in no way passive—there is rage and determination burning in each note. Pulling from a deep sense of history as well as palpable anger at the tumultuous state of the world today,   is not just full of inventive musical ideas, its intention points towards a higher purpose.

There’s a marked shift in  , the Maghreban’s follow-up to 2018’s breakout  . Chalk it up to the global pandemic or other worldwide upheavals, but Rostom realizes the futility of the go-it-alone mindset. Nearly half of the tracks have a featured guest, as Rostom puts it in the album description: “I was seeking and becoming more comfortable with connection whilst making it, rather than keeping myself to myself.” Opening up the process allowed the music to also open up, and   ranges far and wide, from jacking Chicago house to woozy electro-rap to Arabic-tinged jazz, showcasing Rostom’s formidable skills. “Moving” opens the album with a primitive drum machine patter and layers of synths, electronics, and Idris Rahman’s snaking saxophone, reimagining German   through an Arabic lens. On “Celebratory Relapse” and “Black Seed Oil,” Rostom and Rahman push their fusion even closer to future jazz, with Rostom both showing off his piano chops while warping both keys and sax beyond recognition. As the Maghreban’s name suggests (geographically, it’s the region of North Africa adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea), the MENA diaspora is never too far from his mind. He readily draws on his Egyptian and Saudi heritage, mixing these Middle Eastern tonalities into his electronic productions, now adding voices singing and rapping in Egyptian and Swahili.  ’s feisty delivery on “Got Your Number” shows us what Swahili electro could sound like.   lends his aching, melancholic voice to “Anzilli,” while Rostom adds lightness all around the vocalist, creating a track that feels wrenching and buoyant. That juxtaposition of opposites also informs “Baby,” which is a diaphanous, dreamy ambient piece for its first half before a crackling snare drum transforms the track into a fidgety banger. And for all of Rostom’s interest in Arabic fusions, album highlight “Waiting” hearkens back to old-school Chicago house to body-jacking results. Here, Rostom teams up with UK neo-soul legend   and together, the two recall the likes of Larry Heard’s iconic productions with Robert Owens, still the benchmark in vocal house music. It also shows how vital it is to step outside of your own confines and seek out a connection with others, a lesson the Maghreban takes to heart here.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Mogzawa’s talent for constructing hypnotic rhythms might’ve been forecasted in her drumming on Warpaint’s   while Holon’s electropop   with Neon Neon certainly reside in the same sonic neighborhood that they explore here as Belief. Nevertheless, the confines of genre remain potent limiters on the imagination; no matter how much of a trope “genre-bending” has become during this Internet-fueled age of musical bricolage, switchups of this sort still register as a pleasant surprise, especially when executed as well as they are on this debut. “What would Mark Bell do?” This mantra guided the development of Belief’s debut record, and it shows. The sibilant bleeps and murky acid basslines that were a staple for LFO find themselves reincarnated via Mogzawa and Hollon’s productions. The record begins with “I Want To Be,” an anthemic track whose frenetic kicks and breakbeats create an energy that belies its BPM at 128. Armed with a  , an infectious synth progression, and an aspirational mantra, they build an atmosphere appropriate for the ambrosial hours of peak-time raving. While they certainly can make music that’s spiritually uplifting, the duo also have a knack for tapping into the visceral. “WOT” perhaps embodies this best: its four-on-the-floor kicks plod rather than bounce, its synths pierce as the hi-hats hiss, making for a murky track that grounds as much as others like “Jung” and “Art of Love” float. “Nebo” sees both tendencies come to the fore, with acidic 303s creating a foundation that melts into air, dissolved by trance synths and a healthy helping of reverb. Dance music purists need not be distrustful of this offering by apparent outsiders; Belief knows what they are doing, and they do it well. If the first 10 tracks weren’t enough, Mogzawa and Holon save their most intriguing work for last. The emotional, beatless “Charch” might fit in well alongside the cybernetic post-club of a   compilation. It’s a nice postscript, a cliffhanger that leaves us wanting more.

While   fulfills expectations, pairing hard-hitting production with acerbic wordplay, it also offers departures like “No Threat” that push past rap norms. Here, Curly Castro and Zilla Rocca meditate on the nature of violence over earthy drums and ghostly backing vocals. “All those years of sparring/ Learning how to use knives/ You learn discipline and mercy,” Zilla concludes, “violence never served me.” The arrival of Small Pro’s “Sedale Lo Pro Interlude” marks a shift toward a more exploratory and conceptual second half. On “Supreme Rock,” Castro chants about “signs pointing to them aliens on rooftops” as the tension builds for a beat drop, while PremRock’s verse details a holiday marked by train strikes in Paris and complaints about metal plates slowing his voyage through TSA. Wrecking Crew are out to advance the form, favoring interplay over competition, but they’re also not above the typical posse cut posturing. They just flip it to serve their own ends: The recurring “left hand, right hand” motif that kicks off every MC’s verse in “Odom” serves to unify the track, rather than feeling like a contest to see who can deliver the most lethal 16 bars.

What keeps   consistently dynamic is Jordana’s ability to draw from her many musical talents to create an album that is sonically diverse. “I Mean That” highlights her background in violin, its high-energy chorus confronting hesitancy: “Washed up and washed out/ Burned out into drought.” “Get Up” soaks in grungier guitar and percussion with its mantra-like chorus that continues the album’s theme of holding onto confidence through difficulty. “Play Fair” is hard-knocking lyrically, and seamlessly contrasts its early aughts, alternative-rooted production to the joyful determination Jordana brings in through her light-but-resilient vocal work. Whether it’s the low-simmering “Like You Used To” or the addictively raucous “Catch My Drift,” Jordana is committed to self-examination even when it gets uncomfortable.

On “Keepsakes” Maria BC dabbles in hypnagogic pop, pairing blown-out analog synthesizer chords and a barely-perceptible drum machine.

{"album": "The Antidote Suite", "artist": "JoVia Armstrong & Eunoia Society", "description": "There is power in the continuity of musical storytelling. The longer it persists, the stronger, more influential, and more original the music becomes. This is doubly so when a musical narrative starts out already imbued with community intentions then picks up each ensuing generation’s ideas on the subject, embedding that continuity with new hopes and dreams; warnings and examples; sounds and forms. This is how traditions are born, and few contemporary cultural traditions match the power of Great Black Music. Artists with the vision to recognize its full breadth (rather than simply serving it piecemeal via genre categorization) work on an immense canvas; and as time continues to collapse, musicians presenting the breadth of that tradition are addressing nothing less than the full bore of history. This is the context of JoVia Armstrong’s  , the drummer-educator-technologist’s second album under her own name, and a rich document of this diasporic musical continuum from a contemporary perspective. Featuring music written and produced by Armstrong, performed with violinist Leslie DeShazor plus a few community guests, and originally commissioned to accompany the traveling group art show  ,   is an expansive, mostly instrumental work, a soundtrack to the moment when old delineations stop making sense, and intersectionality is less code than new reality—when, as Jason McDaniel’s liner notes say, “the collective consciousness of Black Music is more fluid…than ever before.” Armstrong is well-versed to tackle the moment, as she’s long subscribed to this fluidity. The multi-instrumentalist grew up in Detroit, mentored by the drummer   (whose own roots in the tradition stretch from   to  ), and has been operating in Motor City and Chicago’s diverse musical spaces for nearly 20 years. Her vocals and rhythms have accompanied a host of different musicians: she appears on recordings by, among others, AACM composer Nicole Mitchell ( ) and house don   (who adapted and remixed Armstrong’s song, “Gullah Geechee”); she’s a member of JC Brooks’s retro-soul-punk band   and the all-female, strings and drums quartet,  ; she has been an in-demand touring drummer, and operated a community music school on the South Side. For Armstrong, fluidity is the fuel. And the power of   is how naturally all the parts flow together. With Mitchell’s flute,  ’s guitar, Isaiah Sharkey’s bass, and Amr Fahmy’s Rhodes augmenting DeShazor’s amplified strings, Armstrong’s stripped-down kit, and tactfully added electronic post-production, the textures hint at some near-future sound of global jazz. (The gorgeous Mitchell- and Armstrong-led “Meditations on Oya,” in fact, echoes  ’s similarly minded “Stretch Music.”) But this   is less about solo playing than how the compositions invite each musician to interact with the material and the tradition, creating music that sounds yearning, multivalent, and futuristic. Imitating its title, “Breathe” rises and falls on waves of Parker’s distortions, DeShazor’s violin, and Armstrong’s cymbals, creating a cascading science fiction desert sound. “Shades and Shapes” rises as a guitar/keys/hi-hat funk configuration, before mutating into a kind of Middle Eastern dance tune that showcases DeShazor, then disappearing into the near-ambient space-age electronics of Fahmy’s Rhodes. Best of all is the radical interplay on the  ’s one vocal track: At its start, “Zebra” places the great Chicago singer Yaw Agyeman in front of an incomparable production that has the feeling of D’Angelo’s   but as a lo-fi dub experience, before introducing Teh’Ray Hale’s rap, delivered over laid-back rimshots and glitchy, virus-like blasts. For the rest of the track, the music and the voices keep transforming—the second half is essentially a dub remix of the first—as though the mixing board’s ghosts are getting involved in the storytelling. The elements they add are already part of this tradition (see: Lee Perry, CX KiDTRONiK), but what JoVia Armstrong’s   does is put them on an equal sonic footing with all the others—continuing what came before, making sure it has another place to go.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

Someone who appreciates awe-inspiring string arrangements and Gothic harpsichord grooves as much as runaway guitar riffs and diamond-cut drum loops. In the scheme of his sprawling back catalog,  is Master Boot Record’s mic drop moment, the part where Love tells the synthwave scene—something he’s long avoided and circumvented—to stop playing catch up and pick up a pencil and a pad instead. Forget the fact that he used to release several records a year. What’s truly impressive about this project is the programming itself;   try writing a ride as wild as “80186,” or any of these other power-up pieces for that matter. Considering how tightly woven its template is—Slayer meets saw-toothed synths—Master Boot Record’s music should be the very definition of “monotonous,” and yet it never gets boring. Frankly, it’s exhilarating, making brief respites like the beginning of “80686” and “80386” hit that much harder. It’s no wonder why Love worked on an actual point-and-click adventure not that long ago; his grid-locked singles are the kind of shredders you wanna crank when you’re 10 hours into a Steam binge and running on nothing but Mountain Dew and Cheetos dust.

{"album": "Pripyat", "artist": "Marina Herlop", "description": "Since the advent of DAWs and cheap audio recording technology, the possibilities of making music have exploded, and new musicians still trying to find their voice may find themselves stymied by the seemingly infinite number of avenues open to them. Any genre, sound, or instrument is potentially available to the adventurous artist. On her previous two solo albums,   and  , Marina Herlop made music with what she described in an   as “the only tools I had available”: her classical keyboard training and her clear, rich voice. Those albums evoked beguiling emotions, but never quite stuck the landing. Herlop’s use of non-linguistic vocals in her music—nonsensical made-up syllables instead of intelligible lyrics—is one of her trademarks. The effect can be bizarre and haunting, or sometimes oddly blank. At the Sonar Festival, Herlop commented that she didn’t want her music to tell stories or guide the listener in what to feel, and that the artificial language was so that the music didn’t become obscured with artificial emotion. But on her newest album   she finally feels she has a story worth telling. The album marks a dramatic turning point in Herlop’s artistic practice and reflects an artist in flux, dabbling in new technology and challenging themselves with new compositional techniques. While this is not the first time Herlop has utilized electronic elements in her work,   is the first record she produced entirely herself. As she further remarked in her Sonar interview: “Knowing 15% of Ableton lets you make a lot of music.” The expected pop and club influences are present on  , but Herlop mostly uses her new technological freedom to layer her own voice over and over, revealing a new dimension of orchestral rhythm and counterpoint in her compositions. Perhaps in an effort to ground the newness of her technological approach, Herlop gleefully appropriates traditional sources for inspiration, most clearly and specifically  , the ancient Carnatic system of vocally performing incredibly complex rhythmic cycles using a series of meaningless mnemonic syllables. In concept and execution, this is probably the least fitting element in the album’s sonic vocabulary, but it also provides some of the most exciting moments on the record, both for us and for Herlop, it seems. If art is just an excuse to experience the act and process of creativity, then hearing an artist so clearly excited by their creation is a real pleasure.", "genre": ["Experimental", "avant-garde"]}

As much as its artistic community, the duo also owes a tangible debt to Philadelphia’s rich history of radical Black activism—both their sound and their politics are fiercely defiant and uncompromising. Drowning in glitch, feedback, and fuzz,  is a record steeped in our current reality of endless death, entrenched structural racism, and infrastructural decay—a world where the pain is so constant that, as Moor Mother puts it on “Sixteen,” “nobody even crying.” DJ Haram’s beats weave drum & bass, breakbeats, and bed squeaks with more organic percussion, like the driving tabla that undergirds tracks like “Nightflame” and “No More Kings.” “Anthology” veers into straight-up rave, with Moor Mother acting as equal parts conductor and professor, connecting contemporary club culture to a historical lineage, and paying explicit homage to African-American dance pioneer Katherine Dunham: “I feel like dancing, like they do in Haiti, in Trinidad, in Cuba.” Moor Mother frequently speaks in cultural footnotes, like the moment on “Candace Parker” when she interpolates a bar from Mobb Deep’s “Shook Ones, Pt. II.” The pair’s voices act as aesthetic counterpoints; Moor Mother often comes in aggressive and gruff, DJ Haram more ethereal and vocal-fried. But you can’t pin down either of their flows; the opening verse of “Discipline” is pure slam poetry, before Moor Mother breaks off into a clipped staccato flow that would be at home on a drill track. While she outlines a lyrical horrorcore nightmare, the beat cascades between a threatening bassline and an unsettling synthesizer that sounds like a possessed toy piano. As thoughtful and intentional as 700 Bliss can be, there are also moments of tongue-in-cheek humor. On the interlude “Easyjet,” which feels like an excerpt from a haunted podcast that doesn’t exist, the duo cosplay as their own haters, taking the piss out of the project, complaining about how dark and “pretentious” their own subject matter is: “ wasn’t very spa-like.” And it’s hard not to hear “Bless Grips”—both its title and its style—as a riff on industrial-rap provocateurs  . Moor Mother contorts her voice and snarls in a deep register not dissimilar to MC Ride; but Haram sounds more like Kreayshawn, disarming the duo’s avant-garde tendencies and suffusing it with a little irony.

Away from the glitz, Phillips’s solo work under his   moniker allows him the space to luxuriate without too much thought spared on function; songs like 2019’s “And So, You Were!” arrive as tender, unfurling spools. These Tourist projects allow Phillips—as the name perhaps suggests—to wander.  his third album in a decade-spanning career, packs plenty of inventive drum work and emotive melodic flourishes—all climbing plucked synth lines, and wispy, disembodied vocals—in the vein of contemporaries like  , Fred Again, and  . Like those peers, Phillips dances on the line between peak time with the lights up and headphone music for the journey home. This restraint, at times, is palpable: Album opener “Speak In Symphony” slides and simmers its way in for a good three-and-a-half minutes amid pattering hi-hats and vocal blips reminiscent of a heart monitor, before busting forth with a thumping kick and sumptuously swung UKG snares. Phillips repeats this pattern elsewhere—“A Dedication” feels destined to soundtrack destination festival highlight reels; “Avalanche” gets a dancefloor lick from a chipmunked Ellie Goulding sample—and he builds the album around these moments of release and ephemerality. The result is a fast blur of an album (relatively brief at just over 40 minutes) that can feel like it’s over just as soon as it gets going. Occasionally, the out-and-out euphoria is tinged with melancholia. Much of the album was written in the wake of the sudden death of a close friend. Hemmed in by COVID-19 lockdowns in England, without the release that only sitting and reminiscing with friends can offer, Phillips occupied himself with music. This results in flashes of real fragility and lends a dreamlike quality to interludes like “April” and “With You.” But this isn’t an album that marks loss with dark clothes and trudged processions—“Lark,” like much of  , has a contemplative pulse: at turns dim and murky, yes, but also bright with epiphany.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Flying Doesn’t Help", "artist": "Anthony Moore", "description": "What has characterized  ’s wide-ranging collaborative and solo work—primarily with  and  —is its ability to refract the popular music of its time through a critical prism without sacrificing the vitality, excitement, even naiveté, inherent in those forms.  , released in 1979, finds Moore taking this approach to the glittery T-Rex-  sound of glam and turn-of-the-’80s punk to stirring effect. While the music directly bears the traces of its time—Moore’s multi-tracked vocal choruses and rounded, subtly tape-echoed snares recall the shapeshifting Cale/Eno brand of pop—there is a distinct economy of form and gesture in Moore’s work, a simplicity that becomes complex through repetition and reiteration. Whereas     the prog form, splaying and scattering its bones only to reconstruct them into something qualitatively different and truly complex, Moore takes an intensive approach, unfolding inherent tensions in the prevailing pop forms by recreating them. Through this act of replication, Moore sharpens certain functional components of the pop song: his call-and-response guitar riffs have an unusually serrated edge; his fired-up keyboard noodling has the jarring, alien sound of klaxons. And in between the tinny funk and dub-inflected grooves there arise moments of beauty—see the shimmering breakdown halfway through hit single “Judy Get Down”—as well as a gripping theatricality (“Useless Moments”). The end result of this juxtaposition of popular styles and tropes—all grounded in a driving, mid-tempo drumbeat—is that the structure of the pop song is surfaced and made apparent in all its artifice, just as Ornette’s   music never exceeded a certain static, middling tempo so as to emphasize the rhythmic and tonal content of the music with the utmost clarity. At the same time, the careening joy of the best pop music is wholly preserved—the back-to-back paeans “Lucia” and “Caught Being In Love” are both built atop the ubiquitous “Be My Baby” drum pattern—but the fact that they are by no means wholly “original” only strengthens their effect: the seemingly mystical beauty of pop is that it continues to move us to tears even when its basic formula and inherent derivativeness is made painfully obvious. Slapp Happy took this refractive approach to the gentler sounds of soft rock and cabaret, giving an edge to the seemingly edge-less. Moore takes the already seemingly edgy sound of late-’70s punk, glam, and art pop and teases out its beating heart, in the process creating a music that breaks from its template while still orbiting it. If the music sounds very “of its time,” that is exactly the point: unexpected beauty, pleasure, and delight follow from what only seems like more of the same.", "genre": ["Experimental", "experimental rock"]}

On “Children of Fate,” one the EP’s highlights, Merlin discusses seeking every opportunity, a seat at the table, and the authority to make executive decisions.

Merlin switches from singing to rapping on “Free Grillz” and “No Ego” with an in-your-face style as she expresses pain over funky and action-packed beats.

{"album": "Síntomas de Techno: Ondas Electrónicas Subterráneas desde Perú (1985​-​1991)", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "For almost two decades now, Buh Records has been shining a spotlight on the margins of Latin American music both past and present. Label runner Luis Alvarado has worked indefatigably to excavate and release a wealth of experimental music in danger of being lost to time—a project which grew organically out of his ongoing commitment to contemporary scenes in Lima and beyond. The Peru-focused   collection is a robust example of Buh’s archival mission: ranging from the work of electroacoustic pioneers in the ’60s and ’70s to the gritty punk and noise of ’80s and ’90s underground movements, the scope of the series shows that Buh isn’t just filling holes in the history of Peruvian experimental music, but is actively participating in the creation of such a history. Síntomas de techno, the latest Sounds Essentials volume, covers a period of transition between Peru’s   (underground rock) of the mid-’80s and the various local electronic music scenes that consolidated during the ’90s. The shadow of rock and punk looms large over this compilation, just as it did over many synth-pop and industrial groups in Europe at the time; in the Peru scene’s early days, the post-punk kids and the synth tinkerers all played the same shows. “La Gran Masa” is a hardcore scorcher arranged for synthesizer and drum machine—it even has breakdowns with rapid drum fills that pop off, despite technical limitation. The motorik beat, stilted guitar, and sustained synths that open “A dónde” place it firmly in post-punk territory, but the song’s bridge has an infectious bounce that foregrounds the rudimentary electronics at play. Notably, both tracks are by projects of ex-members of Narcosis, a seminal rock   band. Of course, the growth of “techno-pop” in Peru was as much a matter of new music as of new technology. People danced to new wave, post-punk, and EBM in Lima’s alternative clubs; they traded tapes with others from around the world, and fanzines covered acts like Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, The Human League, and D.A.F. “Martillo,” the opening track on  , stands out as an industrial tour de force, grafting found metal percussion à la Einstürzende Neubauten onto a relentless mechanical rhythm as dictated by a Casiotone. It’s also easy to hear Nitzer Ebb and Front 242 in “No Nunca,” with its terse, shouted vocals and a groove grounded by an overdriven bassline, but the simple drum pattern manages to keep it punk. Only on the last few songs, with their sequenced synths and wider range of electronic timbres, do we get a glimpse of the dancefloor to come: “Y de aquí no me voy” is a bona fide synth-pop gem with delightful counterpoint between pulsing streams of sixteenth notes and a succession of synth lines, generating effortless forward movement, and the tempo and four-on-the-floor kick of “Primera secuencia” make it the most suggestive of techno proper out of all the tracks here. The stylistic diversity present on this album illustrates a scene in the process of finding itself—a scene that hadn’t yet fixed internal divisions or external boundaries. It’s why   isn’t really a genre compilation, but rather, a document of people searching for genre.", "genre": ["Experimental", "Electronic"]}

Just look at the near pitch-black of the cover of EMÆNUEL’s third release   (either as the cassette J-card or as a .jpg) and try to decipher the gray shape in the lower corner. Is it an x-ray of an egg? Is it from a brain MRI scan? Might it be EMÆNUEL’s own skull? While the album was said to have been written years before, when EMÆNUEL was living/visiting/traveling through the tumultuous Indian city of Kolkata, “an experiment in rapid exploration,” that exotic location belies the profound sense of interiority of the music itself. The Nigerian artist might be mysterious, but we find ourselves deeply immersed in his soundworld, which has a few similarities to the likes of Demdike Stare,  , or   (with a touch of the clamor of the artists on the   roster), but it’s hard to imagine that any sound originates from the outside world, as everything seems to arise from some dark, turbid place. Listen to “Rivers of Blood” on headphones and you might conflate its echoing pings, metallic clangs, and watery drips with other noises, so neatly does it dissolve amid the exterior noises of a subterranean subway ride, or in the lightless ambiance of an echoing cave. EMÆNUEL is adept at making every sound feel temporal, intangible. So even amid the heavy throb and percussion of “Bhadralok,” bass-heavy fuzz-blasts keep knocking the rhythmic clatter off-center, unsettled. “Cold” also cloaks itself in shoegaze-heavy distortion, as if channeled through thoroughly blasted earbuds. “Dust” lives up to its title, the droney ambiance at the beginning of the piece melting away to reveal even more desolate space, It’s here that the darkness of the first half of the album begins to let in a little glint of light, as mesmerizing shimmer and the sounds of running water overtake the piece. “Ambrosia” begins with a dense din, only to widen as a deep bass tone sounds and higher, bell-like chimes start to resonate.  , as the accompanying text explains, “is dedicated to a friend who restored faith in the artist.” Moving from a despairing to hopeful outlook, that sense of dichotomy informs the entire album.

Featuring The Sonic Liberation Singers—a quartet of vocalists affiliated with Philly’s University of the Arts—  ranges from abstract vocalization to Lake’s poetry recitations. The album opens with “What,” a grooving, mid-tempo tune built around Matt Engle’s bassline deftly mirrored by harmonizing singers. Veteran Philly free-jazz saxophonist Elliot Levin delivers a playfully searching solo, while Veronica Jurkiewiczs’s violin solo is electrifying and nearly psychedelic. “Ain’t Nothin’ But Love” is a gorgeous, utopian tune about the divine power of love. As the Sonic Liberation Singers lay out a sweet bed of vocal harmonizes behind him, Lake steps to the mic to inform us that “It ain’t hard to understand love once you know how it works. Love, the precious gift. Ain’t nothin real but love…” The title track, “Justice,” finds the entire ensemble playing together beautifully: drummer Kevin Diehl and Engle lay down a dynamic, ever-shifting rhythmic template over weighty, mournful melodies by Jurkiewicz and flutist Jameka Gordon. Levin’s solo here is particularly furious, his scorching, circular lines pushing us to the edge of collapse. It’s not all continued momentum, though: “Clouds” is a drifting suite that opens with Diehl soloing on percussion before joining the vocal section. Here, Gordon and Jurkiewicz improvise, making distinct melodic statements while also skillfully interacting with each other. The album closes on an optimistic, triumphant upswing. “Round 2000” is a rich, understated piece that again finds the singers mirroring Engle’s grooving, economical basslines. “Round 2000” seems to flow seamlessly into the album’s closer, “Lucky One.” The tune’s opening melody sets the tone before the rhythm section enters alongside Lake’s vivid poem and his detailed cataloging of land, locations, and ancestral memories. As Lake’s first set of compositions that center on the voice,  utilizes singing and poetry as humanizing elements that ground the music throughout. As interpreters of Lake’s compositions, Sonic Liberation Front brings a musical depth and openness to the proceedings that compliment Lake’s pieces.

With it, he envisioned keeping Beja music alive, something that was difficult in his home country of Sudan when the former Head of State, Omar al-Bashir, made   to erase the Beja peoples’s culture and deny them their rights. Since the 1989 military coup that led to his rise in power, the government has closed down the nation’s music halls, forbade the creation and consumption of music, with the exception of songs that explicitly glorified Islam or war; and facilitated the imprisonment, torture, and murder of artists. Fearing for their safety, many Sudanese musicians fled the country altogether, prompting a nationwide decline in popular music that’s persisted to this day. Sudanese music has always been intertwined with politics and social change, and  follows that lineage. While it’s an entirely instrumental record, Noori believes that bringing this music out into the world can “form the most potent act of resistance,” moving in lockstep with Beja activists’s ongoing cries for justice. “Al Amal,” which translates to “Hope,” brings some clarity to this idea. Its percussion and rhythm guitar provide a sturdy foundation for the tambo-guitar and tenor sax to intertwine elegantly. At times they mirror each other’s sinuous melodies, and just as striking are the flashier solos. Their music soars in both an encouraging and focused manner, and one can credit that to their collaborative groupthink as much as their individual strengths. One of the most stirring aspects of Noori & His Dorpa Band’s music is that they’re in dialogue with Sudanese music from decades past.   recalls artists like   or Abdel Gadir Salim in how, with their blending of Western and African musical styles, craft a sound all their own. One of the album’s highlights, “Jabana,” is a smoky blues endeavor but is more meditative than a typical desert blues track; It’s reminiscent of   if it weren’t for the lilting sax and winding melodies granting it a more enchanting aura. Elsewhere there’s “Daleb,” spearheaded by a hypnotic, pulsing guitar rhythm that’s simultaneously jagged and cozy; and “Saagama,” whose arid guitar melodies and ambling tabla rhythms capture the spirit of traversing the Nubian.

The eerie depths of the ambient “tucked in my stomach!” gives way to the melancholy, meditative piano on “yes! my weeping frame!” The moody hum of the title track transforms into the echoing, bell-like tones of “symphonies sweeping,” a journey that ends more pensive than it began with the appearance of lower tones in the octave range, and “to fill the quiet!” rides the swelling waves of a single synth melody. OHYUNG seems to have mapped the evolution of the tracks to create the greatest emotional impact. “my hands hold flora!” is peppered with white noise loops and a grating metallic edge, but gradually transitions from its skittish beginning into something more euphoric, ending on a single note from a pan flute. “Philodendrons trail!” builds discomfort with its distorted beat and melody, and the solemn notes of album closer “releases like gloves!” are transformed as the lower-end accompaniment gradually comes to the forefront.

{"album": "Live in New York Cit", "artist": "Alan Braufman", "description": "The belated renaissance of composer-saxophonist   continues with the discovery and release of this sprawling live sextet performance, one of the more thorough and compelling documents of a single ensemble during the New York’s intrepid Loft Jazz scene of the 1970s. The 94-minutes that comprise   were originally performed as a radio broadcast at the   just months after Braufman recorded his debut album,   in the first-floor storefront of his loft at 501 Canal Street late in 1974. When   was reissued 44 years later in 2018, it rekindled interest in Braufman, who seized the moment and recorded   in late August of 2020. Like the debut,   has aged remarkably well. And like his most recent effort, it threads together music of varying moods and intensity with confident, cohesive exuberance. The 16 compositions are conjoined into four suites, often initiated by Cooper-Moore, who opens “Rainbow Warriors” on dulcimer, laying yearning strings over a variety of percussion, before shifting to piano for the thorny “Ark of Salvation.” A piano vamp that feels like a stern nursery rhyme on “Little Nabil’s March” leads the group in a more straight-ahead direction before another tail-chasing maelstrom ensues, complete with skronking horns, piano glissandos, and high-pitched whistles from Ralph Williams (better known later for his association with  ). The placid horns of “Destiny,” especially some gorgeous French horn from John Clark, provide an oasis that closes the first suite. The five songs in the second suite contain the probing experimentation (“free jazz”) and Afrocentric textures and rhythms often associated with loft music, and arguably provide the most consistent highlights of the entire performance. Cooper-Moore again leads off on “Ashimba”—named after the 11-note xylophone he plays, which is constructed from discarded wood—accompanied by a fusillade of percussion. He likewise performs the recitations on “Chant,” a portentous ballad in the mode of Coltrane, with Braufman on flute. The next trio of songs—“Thankfulness,” “Love Is For Real,” and “Foreshadow,” are delightfully wild and woolly, with passionate interplay too purposeful and penetrating to be dismissed as noise. Braufman is superb on alto, and Clark mimics the human cry on French horn; but lengthy, torrid bass passages and solos by   take top honors. This concert marked the first meeting between Parker and Cooper-Moore, and the first of dozens of occasions when the pair formed the heart and soul of a live performance. The songs and suites after the intermission are generally more melodic and easily accessible. Cooper-Moore’s   solo then abetted by percussion from Williams lays a foundation on “Emancipation,” and Braufman’s flute, undergirded by spare drums and percussion, provides a sinuous Middle Eastern vibe to “Tree of Life.” The pace quickens into more of a jig on “Bright Evenings,” and “The Muse” and “A Tear and a Smile” both benefit from the contrast between Braufman’s lilting flute and the low register of Clark’s horn, which sounds akin to a trombone or tuba. Just as most of the compositions before intermission match the song list on “Valley of Search,” the final piece of  , entitled “Sunrise,” became the lead song on “The Fire Still Burns” in 2020. Braufman appropriately considers his oeuvre as a continuum, or perhaps a helix, twirling with the relevance of compassionate artistry and bold experimentation through the decades.

{"album": "Incubator", "artist": "Primer", "description": "Honesty has always come easy for Alyssa Midcalf. As  , music becomes a portal, capable of transforming the deepest pain into something beautiful. On her expansive 2019 debut  , her songs play like diary entries, set against walls of electro-pop production and exposing the tenderest parts of herself with bravery and trust. On her new album  , a careening blast of new wave synth-pop, the vocalist and producer continues along this trajectory, joining devastating lyrics with production that is undeniably danceable. Co-produced with Noah Prebish, the songs on   wade through existential dread and emotional detritus, exploring the most vulnerable parts of Midcalf’s life without shame or reservation. Beneath the enthusiastic charge of synth and thrumming bass is a bedrock of heartache and self-doubt. Album opener “Impossible Thoughts” considers the worthiness of building a meaningful life while the world around her falls apart. “If You Need Me” candidly addresses Midcalf’s struggles with depression (“When you wanna die/ You can call me anytime/ I know what that’s like”), and on the soaring ballad “Anything,” she works through the pain of being trapped in a manipulative relationship: “I will sacrifice my needs to be with you/ Oh my love I am holding on for dear life/ But I’m just pretending/ Something’s missing deep inside.” Despite the darkness of the lyrics, the production surprises and delights throughout, with warm layers of synth swells and perfectly timed beat drops. Dance jam “Hypercube” buzzes with feedback and crunchy synths before softening into a quiet, dreamy soundscape. “Giving Up” oozes confidence, hypnotizing with stacks of staggered, harmonized vocals and crisp snare hits. And “Feel The Way I Do” strides in with an infectious, walking bassline and bright trilling bells, summoning a neon-lit ‘80s nostalgia, emotionally indulgent, and dancefloor-ready. While   travels dark territory, the mood is anything but defeated. There’s a sense of triumph surging throughout—of finally landing on the other side of heartbreak, of being able to trust yourself, of cutting through the noise.   is a determined push through the fog, with Midcalf emerging, at last, into clear air, shining and new.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly", "artist": "Tanika Charles", "description": "Is there a corner of contemporary music where the margin between enduring triumph and retro cliche is as razor-thin as throwback soul? It’s a style whose recorded elements are mass-produced with precision—part of pop’s everyday furniture—yet which occasionally exudes such aesthetic thrills that its cultural reserve feels bottomless. This is a good lens through which to value Toronto-based singer  , who’s been squeezing modernity out of classic soul for over a decade, tweaking a set of timeworn musical values that, under her control, retain a natural outsized potency. Charles is there for lovers of sharp kiss-off R&B scorchers, and the gut-wrenching ballads with the tsunami vocals, mixing unfiltered emotions with comedic double entendres. She satisfies the heads attuned to the tone of hollow-body electric guitars, Fender Rhodes keys, and Vox organs, backed by rim-shots, handclaps, and shuffles from the funky drummer’s handbook. Her productions satisfy connoisseurs who regard 1965-72 as the apex of studio feels and small-group arrangements, but who also admire a well-placed rap feature, synth preset, or small sonic tricks that allow them to forego a calendar glance. Charles’s recordings do all that—and lend her specialty soul a commercial appeal, without abandoning the artistic principles it’s been forged on. Those values, and the accompanying sounds, continue to be central on Charles’s third album,  —yet the music also stretches far beyond simple definitions. If the sweetly stylized background voices and well-placed horn sections floating over the taut bass-drums riddims remain bedrocks behind Charles’s powerhouse lead, the increasingly airy keyboards and the warm empty space in the album’s overall mix often hint at newer, quieter storms, or a different kind of club. The jazzy guitar and electric piano chords, staccato back-up singers, and Charles’s breathy delivery on “Frustrated” give off the lush feel of a late ‘70s/early ‘80s Quincy Jones classic (or Prince’s “Ballad of Dorothy Parker”). And no one would be the wiser if the tight production of “Different Morning,” with its guest verse by Toronto rapper  , was regarded as downtempo house music. Then again, Charles’s previously lived-in spaces also create great simple pleasures: “Paintbrush and a Palette” is one of those popping-fun metaphor-driven delicacies (with a reserved wink to the  ) that any Music Row writer would be proud of. And “Hold Me (Like a Grudge),” a heartfelt, funk guitar-driven midtempo number about a love affair being stifled, could be the dictionary definition of classic soul music, unpacking emotional complication with melancholy minor chords, biting wordplay, and a juxtaposition of Charles’s yearning for better and her background singers’s cooing of melody. It could have been set to tape at any point in the last five decades, without ever seeming out of place.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}
{"album": "Crime of Passing", "artist": "Crime of Passing", "description": "’s 2016 demo offered a cold, lo-fi take on post-punk, with buzzy keys, low, haunting vocals, and hard industrial drums. Three releases later, the Cincinnati band has morphed from a solo project into a five-piece, in the process embracing a fuller sound while carrying forward their unpretentious coldwave roots. On this stellar  , layers of sound expertly dance over one another, as on the slinky “Hunting Knife,” with snippets of skronky horns, krautrock-style effects, and electronic drums. The songs are mostly new. Two show up on earlier releases, though these versions are brighter, clearer, as if glowing with white-hot energy. The record makes the case for proceeding slowly and steadily; the band sounds as if it’s really had a chance to grow into a mature, cohesive unit. These days, Andie Luman has taken over lead vocal duties from the band’s founder Dakota Carlyle. She masterfully sets the mood of each track, from the whispers on the new-wave-y “Vision Talk” to the echoey cries on the eerie, hard-edged “Damrak.” Crime of Passing often harks back to an early ‘80s sound, like on the darkly pop “Ways of Hiding”—not unlike Texas band  —but it does so without being kitschy. Luman’s voice rings true; her words feel urgent and tinged with romantic desire, as if she’s pleading with us to listen. If you were to catch a live show, I imagine the effect would be quite like this record sounds. The band’s take on post-punk isn’t super polished, like a lot of other contemporary bands. But it doesn’t get much closer to perfection than the one-two punch of the upbeat “Tender Fixation” followed by the mellow “Vision Talk,” an earlier version of which was teased as a single last year. The former glitters with guitar harmonics, surfy riffs, and filtered, Karen O.-style yelps. It’s infectious. Luman brings us low, with spoken utterances that sound as if they’re delivered through an overhead speaker, and then high, with prolonged howls that rise above the instrumentation. The latter is quietly lush, with layers of bright keys, guitar, and bass that complicate Luman’s pained vocals. Crime of Passing shares members with   and  , two other vibrant, eclectic Cincinnati outfits—and there is definitely sonic overlap here. Each band dabbles in the hypnotic electronic rhythms of krautrock, with a clear interest in complex elements of sound.

{"album": "Dreams Drenched in Static", "artist": "Cremation Lily", "description": "Zen Zsigo has been recording music as   for a little over a decade now, but listen to   in the broader context of his back catalog, and it’s clear he’s still in the process of shaping and refining the project’s vision. Early Cremation Lily releases—many of which saw the light through Zsigo’s cassette label  —explored a particularly vulnerable and anguished take on noise and power electronics. Noise remains a component of the Cremation Lily sound, but more recently it’s been joined by new inputs: the warm currents of ambient music, the textural investigations of field recording and—perhaps most surprisingly—the romantic introspection of emotional hardcore. On paper, these genres are strange bedfellows, but  —Zsigo’s first release for San Francisco avant-metal label  —hangs together as well as it does because fundamentally, Cremation Lily is an act of intensely personal expression. Throughout his recording career, Zsigo has sprinkled his work with allusions to traumas past and present: an unhappy childhood characterized by neglect and abuse, and a near-death experience in the sea near his home along the South Coast of England. Cremation Lily’s music often seems to be concerned with healing. But it makes sense that it often sounds violent, purgative. The music here can be pretty, can be harsh, and can often be both at the same time. Take “Wavering Blood,” on which Zsigo’s crooned vocal is all but obliterated by crashing waves of shoegaze guitar, the insistent tick of trap percussion, and an occasional blowtorch blast of distortion. But   has the quality of sonic collage; it ebbs and flows, makes unexpected leaps and takes unexpected turns. Songs erupt out of pools of ambience; spoken word segments are slowed to a crawl, as if played through a Walkman with fading batteries. On “Overflowing Velvet,” cello and acoustic guitar join together in a mournfully beautiful melody before slowly receding before a harsh wall of feedback. isn’t entirely without outside reference points. The album’s more realized songs—“Selfless,” “I Need To Stop Blaming Myself”—feel of a piece with the emo/cloud rap fusions of one of Zsigo’s sometime collaborators,  . Its blend of poetic introspection and harsh noise brings to mind an album like Prurient’s  . But primarily,  succeeds because it feels like a work of unflinching honesty; its collision of genres, its fractured songs, an attempt at working through a tangle of thoughts and feelings that are almost too heavy to shoulder.", "genre": ["Metal"]}
{"album": "everything perfect is already here", "artist": "claire rousay", "description": "There’s a moment amidst the ephemeral beauty of the title track to  ’s new album,  , that I can’t get out of my head. After vaporous passages of processed chamber music and a flourish of chirpy electronics (performed by Mari Maurice, aka  ), we’re left in the hiss of rousay’s open microphones. Gradually, a voice begins speaking, but the blur of low-volume recording, background noise, and the speaker’s hushed tone makes it hard to tell if they’re saying they “love,” “left,” or “lost,” someone. Each word speaks to a sense of impermanence and unknowing that rousay, leading a band of friends and frequent collaborators, captures throughout what may be her finest album yet. One of the great things about rousay’s music is that she never lets you get too lost in it. The Austin-based musician has created some of the best ambient music being made today, but her work is just as likely to jar you with a sudden windswept microphone or murmur of conversation, a joke, or a song. It is music that pushes back at you, reaching out with sounds and words. “A Kind Of Promise” ended last year’s   with a tender piano and cello duet, complemented by blurts of sped-up tape noise. Each of the players on  bring an immense intimacy to the proceedings. Early in the sprawling first track “it feels foolish to care,” Marilu Donovon of   plays harp alongside a soft clatter of timbres and voices, while pianist   provides a profoundly emotional close that feels like listening in on a rehearsal. Yet rather than these pieces feeling like a glimpse into some imagined space, rousay’s careful treatment of sound and editing is only heightened when played inside a real one. Her close-mic’d textures—gentle sensations you nonetheless brace for—grow even more effective when they can fill a room, imparting themselves in the moment with each passage of beauty, disruption or weight. Just as the small sounds of  gradually feel vast, so too does its emotional scope. It’s an album that brings so much in both moments of sadness and joy.

{"album": "WEMA", "artist": "WEMA", "description": "Towards the end of the first pandemic summer, one that featured some of the biggest mass social-justice protests in a generation, the Upstate New York-based electronic producer   (Evan Shorstein) released   by the London’s Afro-Latin dance band Penya. At the time, the song’s lyrical refrain,“Are you doing it for the people, or are you trying to just hide away,” coupled with the natural blend of Photay and Penya’s complementary sensibilities felt anthemic. “People” demanded that artists and listeners not just align with the right side of history, but choose how to live through it, consciously leaping into the meaning of a moment that was at once specific and open-ended. WEMA—the remote-recording pandemic collective that reunites Photay with members of   (producer “Magnus P.I.” Mehta, vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Lilli Elina, percussionist Jimmy le Messurier), as well as  , musical scion of Tanzania’s first family of Gogo music—is a natural continuation of that desire, expanding global connectivity through rhythm and folkways. The hippie intentions of the group’s name—Swahili for kindness and benevolence—ring out in lyrics that endorse a sensible, spiritually reflective existence. But it’s the tension between WEMA’s words and musical choices (polyglot instrumental pairings, thick beat layers of drums and machines, psychedelic post-production crevices) that push   beyond mere platitudes. This music is a positivist rage against the modern-world machine, powered by the force of trance-like improvised rituals, as practiced in different parts of the world. Most of  ’s tracks are two-parters—Part 1’s primarily sung in Swahili by Zawose, and Part 2’s primarily by Elina in Spanish—though they’re less like the flip-sides of old R&B singles or Jamaican versions than two different spins on a single idea, or a beat. Next to one another, they present cohesive juxtapositions of humanity as a cultural kaleidoscope. “Luanje” is one great example. On Part 1, Zawose is in call-and-response mode: his deeply processed vocal trying to shake off generational trauma, surrounded by wood-block and shakers, electronic bass-plus-kick-drum gyrations that hold forth their own staccato conversation, and sampled voices bending beyond comprehension. Halfway through this chaos, a kora appears alongside Elina singing about taking refuge in the shadow of a ceiba tree. When Zawose returns, the previous elements have coalesced in a rolling mid-tempo Afrobeat techno atmosphere, with Magnus’ organ recalling Fela’s Egypt 70. Part 2 picks up from Elina’s short appearance: leading with the kora, interweaving guitar and organ lines, lightly toasted percussion, and ominous sound effects, all taken at a fraction of its predecessor’s pace and intensity. Elina’s song is about the generational reverberations of an aging tree, taking the form of a naturalist sunrise salutation; and it’s not hard to see the relationship between the two parts. “Msafiri Jam” is even better. “Pt. 1” sets up a high-speed acoustic African-dance atmosphere (a bolafon that sounds like it’s on Sun Ra’s cosmic trip, various hand-drums, a break-neck hi-hat), before synthesizers start sneaking into the mix, in and around Zawose’s big group call–and-response; yet the longer its glorious chaos continues, the more modernity’s ghost voices make their presence felt. “Pt.2” keeps the tempo, but leads with the type of kick-drum sound whose influence has escaped Berlin for Dar Es Salaam. The bolafon now sounds entirely synthetic, Elina’s incantation is in the service of pure dance exultation, and when Cuban trumpeter Yelfris Valdes shows up to lead a horn-line, the energy transforms into something that could emanate from ceremonial good times on either side of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Listening to such intricate musical mutations, charting their rhythmic routes, is another way of asking what kind of life we want for ourselves, and for the world. There is something magnanimously obvious and direct in WEMA’s answer. But maybe that’s the best way to make listeners consider it as a true option.  ", "genre": ["World"]}

{"album": "Strawberry", "artist": "Caroline Loveglow", "description": "It’s tempting to view the palpable loneliness that winds through  ’s dreamy debut in the context of COVID-19 lockdowns, but isolation is hardly an invention of the pandemic. In fact,   was written over 5 months in 2019, when the singer was working long shifts at a restaurant, living without roommates for the first time, and nursing her wounds from a breakup. Anyone sapped by the exceedingly draining demands of modern capitalism will recognize the need to retreat to a private internal landscape, while also recognizing the unsustainability of those coping mechanisms. Loveglow is a noted fan of Brian Eno, and like  ,   is music for liminal spaces—not only airports, but midnight solo laundromat runs, bus rides through the gleaming steel of an empty downtown, and late-night bedrooms lit by the  l. The connections described in her songs are fleeting, tenuous, but her music is anything but, filled with warm drones and shimmering guitar, all held together with her intimate vocals and unerring pop sensibility. Opener “Patience, Etc…” serves as a strong introduction to Loveglow (it’s the song that first brought her to George Clanton’s attention after she submitted a demo version to  ’s live VR podcast). There she sings of preachers, unconsummated sin, and apocalypse, all cloaked in a desire for closeness. Lead single “Happy Happy” amps up the yearning with an explosive chorus, while title track, “Strawberry,” opens with the sound of gasping, which is swiftly soothed by wistful guitar. Loveglow neatly articulates the ways that settling for your current circumstances can shrink your vision as she coos, “Playing pretend feels the same as the real thing, same as the real thing.” She continues exploring the intoxication of fantasy on the dizzying “Zenosyne,” where shoegaze guitars underscore the tale of someone trapped alone in their “dream hotel,” deaf to Loveglow’s pleas to “be what you want.” “Foxy” and “Blue Arcade,” both feature protagonists alone in public places, be they bars or suit shops, avoiding the narrator in favor of fame and vice respectively. Fittingly, they are the most musically contemplative moments on  , emphasizing the distance between singer and subject. The synths that accompany “Sink” bring to mind early CHVRCHES at their most delicate, as Loveglow tenderly sings, “How it feels to sink is such a lonely, lonely, thing.” It’s a heartbreaking song, one that holds all the pain of adulthood while wishing for earlier, easier times and recognizing the impossibility of going back. “On Earth,” continues the descent, somehow finding Loveglow full circle as she mixes blasphemy and prayer again. “I wanna see God, and then I’ll believe him,” she sings over brittle and expansive beats. “I’m drowning in feeling,” she laments as the record ends, and while it’s not a hopeful note, it’s still somehow comforting. Loveglow knows the landscape of the internal isn’t the healthiest place to spend your life, but that familiar pain can still be a comfort. A choice to retreat is still a choice, especially in a world that demands so much.", "genre": ["Pop"]}

{"album": "Fisca", "artist": "Blanche Blanche Blanche", "description": "The experimental project  —the duo of vocalist Sarah Smith and multi-instrumentalist Zach Phillips—first surfaced in 2011 with hyperactive synth-pop as fuzzy as a decayed VHS tape and a tireless enthusiasm that fueled nine albums in just a few years. While early releases like 2012’s   felt of a piece with the hypnagogic pop trend of the moment, the group’s true strengths—the playful and beautifully emotive vocals behind Smith’s deceptive monotone and Phillips’s increasingly complex arrangements and dynamic band-leading—have only grown richer over time. That’s never felt more clear than on  , an album that reinterprets gems throughout the triple Blanche songbook alongside some longtime collaborators. It’s at once the most alive these songs have ever sounded while making a case for the brilliant songwriters Phillips and Smith have always been. While the 13 songs here are mostly drawn from Blanche Blanche Blanche’s original run of releases between 2011 to 2014 (the fantastic “Return of the Simple Child” appeared on last year’s comeback album   and sounds completely transformed),   never feels focused on the past. Instead, the album folds seamlessly in with Phillips’s recent label  , a series of releases building on his collaborative “open session rock” approach that began with 2021’s lovely chanteuse-influenced   from Fievel Is Glauque . Players from those projects and earlier iterations of Blanche Blanche Blanche join and, together, the group find distinct ways to revisit each song. Sometimes these are sonic improvements like “In The Ring,” which cuts the distorted news interview playing in the original to wonderfully emphasize the sense of space and atmosphere. Other changes are more subtle, like opener “Alots B4” which passes some of the original’s synthesizer stabs to Billy McShane’s alto sax, or the band’s 2011 debut single “Talk Out Loud” which gains a new momentum through drummer Jo Miller-Gamble’s rushing snare. But more than any individual shift, it’s the fluid sense of conversation between band members that shines through every song. While listening to  , I got the idea to rebuild the tracklist using the original versions of songs. Initially, I thought I’d compare which versions were “better,” but terms like that seem so far removed from Phillips and Smith’s entire approach to making or thinking about music. Instead, I was left with a greater appreciation for these songs on a skeletal level across every era of this wonderful, underrated band; the melodic flourishes, whether they’re played by a tight jazz-fusion outfit or blasted out of an old Casio, and the assuredness with which Smith cuts through the whole spectrum with both funny and heartswelling hooks at every turn. It feels like an introduction regardless of your familiarity, with each song crafting its own path to further appreciation. Don’t call it a “Best Of”— that would require looking backwards and   shows Blanche Blanche Blanche will never stop charging confidently ahead.", "genre": ["Experimental", "experimental rock"]}

Across the album’s dream-like tracks, Todd and her avatar describe a world driven by empathy and mental health positivity.

{"album": "… y que Calvos!", "artist": "Los Calvos", "description": "The newest entry in   extensive catalog of tropical gems is a reissue of  s mold-breaking, 1968 sophomore album   The incandescent group was founded and directed by legendary Venezuelan musician and composer Ray Perez—one of his many contributions to the salsa canon which include Ray Perez y Su Charanga, , and possibly his best-known project,  . But while Los Calvos never performed live or achieved major renown, their legacy as patron saints of avant-garde salsa was cemented with quirky musical choices that stretched the boundaries of salsa as it was known then, and even now. Salsa is of course a meticulously balanced marriage of anthemic songwriting, blaring horns, and dizzying percussion, though back in the late 1960s, Perez had the unusual idea of adding a drum kit to the mix. According to the liner notes, drummer Frank “El Pavo” Hernández famously likened the suggestion to eating pasta with avocado, but the instrument’s faster, more resonant possibilities shine especially bright on “Suenan Los Cueros.” The song has become one of Los Calvos’s most emblematic cuts as it also showcases the tremendous prowess of one of the group’s two main vocalists, Carlos “Calaven” Yanes, who begins scatting wildly in a fierce duel with Hernandez’s dazzling drum solo. While “Suenan Los Cueros” highlights the band’s jazz sensibilities, “El Marciano” nods at sci-fi camp, prominently featuring a glass harp melody that recalls flying saucers in black and white celluloid. The silly premise of Calaven going for a night on the town with a martian again allows enough flexibility for his nimble vocal improvisations, often breaking into gibberish or having his vocals played in reverse. Los Calvos’s other vocalist Carlos “Carlín” Asicio Rodríguez also holds his own, helming a fantastic call and response singalong on “Tiene la Razón” and handily cutting through booming percussion on “El Tumbeleco.” As musical director, Perez also takes every opportunity to shine, sculpting the rhythmic backbone for the delectable rumba jam “La Lengua” from behind the keys. Meanwhile on “José,” Perez fully steals the spotlight with a soaring piano solo that slowly crescendos from behind Calaven’s cheeky improvisations and transforms into the song’s effervescent centerpiece. You can hear the musicians playfully one-upping each other throughout  !, clearly more interested in capturing exciting studio spontaneity than aiming for a hit. No doubt, cuts like “Salsa y Sandunga” and “La Rumba Te Llama” could fit neatly into  ‘s glimmering catalog of standards, but there was never anything neat about Los Calvos or their music. This is wild, raucous salsa from the tropics, forged with Venezuelan humor and inventiveness and unencumbered by rules.", "genre": ["Latin", "salsa"]}

{"album": "Mechanical Sweetness", "artist": "Alyssa Gengos", "description": "From the age of 14 through the release of her 2019 album  , Alyssa Gengos made music under the name Kythira, which is also the name of an island off the coast of Greece that historically served as a crossroads for travelers from across the world. Similarly, Gengos recorded   as she bounced between New York City, Los Angeles, Copenhagen, and Sydney, imbuing her intimate laptop-pop songs with a wandering spirit and a sense of world-weariness. It is surely no coincidence, then, that Gengos is releasing her follow-up,   under her given name, near the end of an extraordinarily static and isolating couple of years. Early in the pandemic, she moved back into her mother’s Los Angeles home, where she used her newfound free time and forced solitude to explore her past, her growth as an artist and as a person, and her own vulnerability. Throughout  , those explorations manifest in different ways. “Gothenburg English” finds Gengos recounting vivid memories as a synth arpeggiator dances in the background before giving way to crunchy electric guitar. In “Me and My Reflection,” she revels in alone time: “It just makes sense to keep to myself,” she sings as the song transitions from deadpan verse to glistening chorus. “Because me and my reflection, we do it well.” And the album’s closing track, “O Kanan Dume,” is a slow-burning ode to a scenic mountain road that recalls another Angeleno artist,  . Elsewhere, Gengos unspools a dreamy lullaby called “Cheerleader of the Universe,” deftly blends reverberant electric guitar and a soulful sway in “Health House,” and delivers a genuine surprise in the title track, when a modest tune suddenly blooms into a beautiful bouquet of melody and vocal harmonies. And then there’s “Good Light,” a charming collision of chintzy drum-machine beats and dramatic synths, wherein Gengos details her California upbringing—county lines, suburban living, expansive views—before pulling back: “I’ll tell you all about my life some other time,” she sings as guitars chug along at a steady pace. That sounds promising. With Kythira in her rearview mirror,   seems to be the sound of Gengos opening up more and more, with rewarding results.", "genre": ["Pop", "indie pop"]}

It can be easy to only think of those words in pleasant contexts—as something soft or peaceful or pastoral—but the Montréal producer has something different in mind on her unsettling debut album  . Her sounds hang together like organs in a body, tightly wound and uncomfortably amorphous, each instrument at least partially digested, every tension unplaceable. Moving at a dreamlike pace while rarely rising above a whisper, Kee Avil has produced a debut of fiendish creativity filled with uniquely gentle terrors.  arrives four years after Kee Avil’s  —a brief three-track release built on guitar harmonics, ASMR vocalizations, and churning electronics—and its greatest strength is in the way Mettler tunnels deeper into that sparse foundation. From the ominous opener “See, my shadow,” Mettler lays out a palette that feels almost subterranean in its use of low-end from drilling electronics to cavernous chords played at the far end of the piano. Songs like “Drying” or “Melting Snow” embrace the void-like spaciousness of early industrial while making uneasy clearings that align the ghostly folk music of  and   to   at their most quietly tense. Every track builds on Mettler’s sound in entirely distinct ways—the prickling micro-cuts that run through “HHHH” like nerve pain, the spindly guitar harmonics twinkling through “And I,” Mark Molnar’s bottomless cello that emerges on the late highlight “Devil’s Sweet Tooth” like the monster in a horror movie’s third act. If there is a secret weapon on  however, it’s Mettler’s own voice and words. Her hushed, seemingly narrow range gradually widens into a chasm of close-mic’d intricacy with lyrics that get under your skin while giving little away—just like the eerie mask she wears in  ’s artwork and music videos, which is somewhere between papier-mâché and Leatherface. It’s here where  gets outright bone-chilling, finding emotional impact in abstraction, as on “Okra Ooze,” where Mettler repeats “What is the perfect balance?” with the maddening intensity of Scott Walker. But it’s the early highlight “saf” that haunts most of all, a song blurring heartache and disease with almost supernatural ambiguity. “Is this the same ache we all share?” she asks, before needling the question even deeper: “Can you feel it there?/ Under your ribs?/ Sitting with its feet up and going nowhere?” It’s a line you can almost physically feel, and it captures Kee Avil’s alluring debut as a whole. The further these dark songs seep into your ears, the more unforgettable   becomes.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "V4 Visions: Of Love & Androids", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "In the early ‘90s the UK’s pirate radio network was flooding the airwaves of London with small-batch bedroom recordings on artist-run indie labels that specialized in street soul, deep house, swingbeat, and jungle. One of those labels was   whose brief lifespan ended when they began shifting away from the homegrown sounds that had been influences on the label—jazz funk, Brit funk, and lover’s rock—in an attempt to compete with the New Jack Swing that was dominating the Billboard charts in the United States. Numero Group’s new retrospective compilation   scrambles that timeline with its non-linear sequencing, resulting in a collection that celebrates the label’s legacy in offering R&B and house with a positive message. It was an 18-year-old from South London named Julie Stapleton who first got V4 Vision blasting on the pirate airwaves with “Just Dreaming” in 1991. Stapleton’s hit rides a mid-tempo beat that draws on lover’s rock and has a synth line in the opening seconds that’s such an earworm, you’ll find yourself looking forward to its return. Stapleton’s single was not about head-in-the-clouds euphoria—it was an extension of Martin Luther King Jr.’s  . It was also a B-side; V4 Visions was hoping to capture listeners with the hypnotic deep house of “Where’s Your Love Gone”—which later found success as a cover by Kylie Minogue on her 1994 self-titled album, earning Stapleton a certified gold plaque. (By contrast, singles from V4 Visions maxed out at 500 copies.) Endangered Species’s convergence of UK’s soul jazz and New York garage house caught the attention of legendary U.S. dance label Strictly Rhythm, who licensed singles from both Endangered Species and fellow V4 Visions artist Ashaye, earning the label international hits. One of the label’s last singles, “Joy In The Jungle” by Jungle Biznizz, is a direct nod to the emerging jungle scene; V4 Visions would cease operations just as jungle and drum & bass began to dominate the dance clubs. It didn’t help that the label was also up against the notorious government crackdowns on dance music, under accusations that nightclubs were hedonistic drug havens corrupting the British youth. Ironically, V4 Visions’s soulful house and street soul was rooted in socio-political messages that defied the mischaracterizations of the music. “Just Dreaming” gave the label an audience beyond the dance floor, but in its later years, the label attempted to capitalize on the New Jack Swing fad—a decision the founders have said that, in hindsight, they regret. Street soul indies like V4 Visions rarely found mainstream chart success, but their legacies resonate to this day in artists like  , FKA Twigs, and Erykah Badu, who take cues from the era’s indelible experimental moments.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

On her 2019 debut album,  the Chicago native captured the relentless push and pull of three cultures in both her lyrics and her fusion of R&B, electronic music, and Latin genres like salsa and bolero. Her latest release  is a continuation of that inner journey, and her music is a vessel for exploring both love in all its forms and the ever-evolving concept of home. The album opens with “Anybody Can Be in Love,” a serene, old-school R&B jam produced by frequent collaborator  , full of psychedelic synths, organic strings, and fuzzy guitars. KAINA reflects on her missed opportunities for love and implores both herself and listeners to accept love in any form—whether romantic or platonic. The spritely title track is an ode to the closeness of family in a small home, and the nostalgia that comes with leaving the nest. KAINA has a gift for poetry, and she paints vivid images that make listeners feel as if they’re walking through this little house with her: “We used to dance till the sun came up/ In a little house, in a little room,” she sings with sweet longing. Sonically,  features a bright, otherworldly take on R&B and electronic music, with the specters of Motown and ‘60s psychedelic folk consistently drifting through the songs. KAINA, with producers like Morimoto and  , manages to make the tracks sound old and new, nostalgic and innovative at the same time. The album is also full of surprises—twists that cement KAINA’s status as a relentless experimenter. “In my mind” and “Ultraviolet” bleed into one another, the former featuring Spanish guitar paired with soaring synths and strings, as KAINA sings about feeling left behind. The tranquility of this track gives way to the raucous “Ultraviolet,” a collaboration with punk rock group  , which feels like ‘90s grunge revisited through a 21st-century lens. ends with the sunny, bossa nova-tinged “Golden Mirror,” a track with a soaring chorus line about letting go of disbelief. In her signature sweet and raspy voice, KAINA sings, “Love may feel like an illusion/ But I see it every day.” KAINA has finally found love, peace, and hopefully a home.

{"album": "IV", "artist": "Letting Up Despite Great Faults", "description": "is the first full-length record   has released in eight years, but the Austin indie pop quartet remains devoted to the dreamy sounds of the ‘80s and early ‘90s. Founded by multi-instrumentalist Mike Lee as a bedroom recording project in 2004, the band developed a seamless blend of cozy electronica and hazy guitar pop, gaining a foothold in the late ‘00s as like-minded artists included   and   channeled their forebears via laptop. Lee’s work during this period felt more like patchwork than the pastiche of his chillwave peers, experimenting with shoegaze, chamber pop, and even IDM over the course of each album. With  however, the band takes a survey of their discography and selects their best ideas, crafting their most consistent, confident sound to date. Critics have been keen to compare them to New Order in the past, but on  , Letting Up sound like the lesser-known Factory signees that put a dreamy, cute spin on Hook and Sumner’s signature sound. The Wake and  , undervalued for bridging the gap between post-punk and twee pop, are the most apparent historical analogs, peeling away a layer of synth and distortion to highlight the jangly melodies at their core. By scaling back the shoegaze-inspired density of his earlier work, Lee has given his voice room to breathe and unfurl within the mix. “I have to have my house in order to be happy here,” he sighs on “Softly, Bravely.” Despite the song’s chipper exterior, Lee probes dark emotions in hushed tones, describing a codependency that comes at the expense of himself. Lee’s lyricism has traditionally fixated on the highs and lows of falling in and out of love, and that’s still the case on  . “Tumble,” shrouded in a thick layer of reverb, even directs Lee’s unrequited feelings inward, longing for lost youth as if one’s past self were a separate person entirely. Guitar riffs simmer and steep in their own juices, building in intensity until they nearly blot out the song’s percussion entirely: Here, Lee’s songwriting is so introspective that the instrumental itself seems to ruminate. Clocking in at just under a half-hour,  may be Letting Up’ shortest album, but it’s not for lack of ideas. Experience has honed the band’s efficient ethos, meaning no track overstays its welcome. Like the best bands in the twee tradition, Lee’s songs are as warm and inviting as a heated blanket—whether you’re snuggled inside to wallow or unwind, it’s the coziness that counts.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "Too Small to Be a Plain", "artist": "Lia Kohl", "description": "Lia Kohl’s process is difficult to pin down, existing somewhere in the hazy margins between composition and improvisation. The Chicago cellist and multi-disciplinary artist has been recognized as a skilled player in both modes, lending her talents to a multitude of artists, from   to   to  . Kohl has made a reputation for herself over the past few years as a supporting pillar of Chicago’s experimental scene, though her name isn’t yet widely known outside of it. Inevitably, an ambitious artist will begin to well up with desire to realize their own creative vision, so Kohl started hitting the studio by herself. The building blocks of her debut album   were collected mostly on the unplanned whims of a series of moments, assembling them with deliberate care later down the line. Finally, a fully-formed display of her abilities was beginning to take shape. “Every day I would go into my studio and make something,” Kohl explains in the album notes, “even if it was a one minute synth loop or a tiny cello improvisation.” On “First Picture of the Weather Pattern” the careful stratification of these sedimentary layers can be heard as the track begins with a ghostly synth loop punctuated by deep reverberating plucks from Kohl’s cello. The crackling of a radio cuts in, occasionally blasting out bite-sized pieces of a melody before giving way to static, as if the dial is in a position between stations. It works as a densely textured piece if you like, but fractals off into a plethora of optional adventures when focusing on an element and trying to isolate it. The eight-plus minute “Moon Bean” takes a more cinematic approach, weaving improvised cello drones into latticework. Mostly keeping ever-so-slightly out of phase, they occasionally sing together in a continuous loop of losing and finding. The effect here is different, but the result is the same: a growing awareness through each track of how each component interacts with all the others. Kohl’s compositions have a similar character to the elaborate spreads of the   books you might have read as a kid: A collection of seemingly disparate things at first glance, but once under the magnifying glass it becomes clear they couldn’t have been arranged that way by accident. Before Kohl knew how the vignettes she created would be used, each one was already destined for a purpose—they could supplement another sound, contrast against it, or prime the listener to recognize a pattern.   has the meticulous structure of an artist with a vision, while still showing all the surprises of someone who’s not afraid to play it by ear.", "genre": ["Experimental", "avant-garde"]}

The Austin-based singer/songwriter gently glides through what seem at first blush like placid waters, but there’s a world of unease and tension to be found just beneath the surface.  is Horn’s first proper solo album, but she’s been busy for a good while, self-releasing singles and EPs and working with bands including Reservations, American Friend, and the rebooted lineup of ‘90s Americana noir cult heroes Knife in the Water. Here, her cool, clear tones and unfussy acoustic strumming are sparsely framed by a small crew of helpmates including guitarist Aaron Blount and bassist Vince Delgado (both of KitW), forging a stark, up-close feel that’s right in sync with some of her cited inspirations, like the lonesome art-folk of ‘70s German balladeer Sybille Baier and the minimalist prose of Raymond Carver.  is far from monochromatic, though. The lo-fi folk-rock feel that dominates the album and lends it a sort of K Records-gone-rootsy mood is broken up by subtle sonic detours like the hazy, dreamtime vibe of “Time Machine,” the twinkly-but-tense   feeling conjured by “Tonight,” and especially the ominous pulse of “Jordan.” Horn was imprinted early by the spiritual pedagogy of her hometown of Glen Rose, a Texas hamlet where the biggest attractions include a creationist museum and a theater featuring an ongoing Christian passion play. A childhood that included regular “bible drills” seems at least partly responsible for the spooky biblical setting of “Jordan.” Delgado’s throbbing bass and Blount’s processed guitar provide an appropriately foreboding accompaniment to a tale of a person compelled to journey to the title city, where they have a vision commanding them to destroy their home of Galilee. But “Jordan” is something of an anomaly both musically and lyrically. Despite Horn’s current status as a postgrad student in fiction writing, she doesn’t go in much for elaborate storytelling, or even poetic flourishes. In keeping with the Carver influence, everything here is pretty close to the bone. It’s an approach that suits the album’s uncluttered feel, and sets Horn’s ostensibly detached delivery up to make a stealthy emotional wallop. The in-your-face darkness of “Jordan” is echoed in more unassuming ways throughout   Even in the otherwise cozy environs of “Tonight,” which begins with Horn cuddling on her couch with a cat, she eventually describes the act of offering comfort as “the chain I choose, the glass that splits my foot.” There’s a push and pull between worry and warmth throughout the album, ultimately settling on a wary uncertainty. The closing track, “When I Go Down into That Night,” takes that feeling to the grave and beyond. Backed only by her own acoustic guitar and seemingly envisioning her own life’s aftermath, Horn asks nothing more than, “Will you meet me where I stand?”", "genre": ["Folk"]}

In a matter of days, bedrooms became movie theaters, couches were converted into offices, kitchens turned into experimental bakeries—for many of us, our homes were suddenly our whole world.

Now, Star Party is back with their debut album  , a collection of eight combustible tracks that cram a whole bunch of fuzzy hooks into a brief 19-minute run time. Corrigan is a veteran of Northwest punk mainstays like   and  , two groups that know how to put the pedal to the metal while maintaining a strong melodic sensibility. For Star Party, he writes the songs, while Brennan pours sugar in the fuel tank with her airy voice, brightening the band’s buzzsaw sound. It’s a formula that works beautifully, and Star Party seems to know it; eight of   nine tracks start with a blast of squealing feedback and distorted guitar, followed by apeshit drums and vocals that sound like a ‘60s girl group entranced by the charms of psychedelic garage rock. If there’s a thematic thread running through  , it’s the persistent frustration that pervades everyday life. On “Living A Lie” Brennan takes aim at an exhausting energy vampire over speedy thrash-pop. “You used to be a sanctuary,” she sings, “now you’re just a parasite.”’ On the record’s catchiest song “Push You Aside” she delivers a scathing send-off to an overbearing suitor. Elsewhere, she targets ennui and stagnation (“Shot Down”), insecurity (“A Trip Home”), and self-centered assholes (“No Excuse”). In each and every case, Brennan delivers her lines with a smile, but her contempt is accentuated by Star Party’s fluent juxtaposition of sweet and sour sounds.", "genre": ["Punk", "indie pop"]}

The Southern Sons’s “I’m A Soldier In God’s Army” is a plaintive gem that serves as a reminder that gospel and the blues emanate from the same source, and draw on the same reservoirs of Black pain and jubilation.

That’s mostly due to von Hausswolff’s masterful way of ratcheting up tension while keeping any sense of release to a minimum. In that way, her songs can often feel like a horror film.

While her last solo LP (2020’s  ) was strictly instrumental and centered on von Hausswolff’s pipe organ passages, this live set draws on the raw power of two earth-shaking recordings, 2015’s   and   from 2018. Fleshed out with a full band (including her sister Maria and a few members of her drone project  ), this isn’t a show in service of selling albums so much as an ominous rock opera that must have reduced the venue to rubble. Outside of the relatively quiet respite that is “Källans Återuppståndelse,” von Hausswolff leaves us very little room to breathe or reflect on what just happened. A 20-minute rendition of “Ugly and Vengeful” is particularly tense, slowly but surely building to a climax so potent that the night could have ended right then and there. Instead, “Come Wander With Me / Deliverance” ends up having that honor, and it rises to the occasion with slashing guitar licks and a telling refrain: “I will never be free.” Of what we’ll never know, but the feeling is universal, and most definitely mutual.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

The piece was created using Smith’s  , a unique framework for musical performance and composition that Smith first introduced in 1967. Ankhrasmation—the root word, “Ankh,” is the ancient Egyptian hieroglyph for “life”—uses colors and movable units to determine how a piece of music is played while leaving the player with options for approaching improvisation. In a  , Smith explained Ankhrasmation as a system that relates to the natural world and beyond: “The colors have to be referenced on various levels. For example, it could be referenced scientifically, according to nature or biology, or it can be referenced according to fantasy, imagination.” It is from this foundation that the trio seeks to capture the weightless, dreamlike feeling of snorkeling in the Pacific Northwest’s Salish Sea on  .

Its songs balance between two extremes: the needs of the body and mind, and the pull of nature. It’s a tension that permeates Carolina Oliveros’s soulful wail in “Oya,” the album’s opening track and a harbinger of the journey that is to come. Oya is a powerful feminine deity—the first feminine   in the Yoruba religion—the goddess of storms and winds, protector of the dead, container for the duality between calm and despair. Over soft guitar arpeggios and atmospheric synths, Combo Chimbita capture a kind of ritualistic calmness—a suspended state that is soothing, but also carries with it the danger of a storm. The group conjures a whirlwind of genres: hip-hop breaks, cumbia, psychedelia, rock, and   serve as a backdrop to stories of racial and societal struggle, anger, love, transcendence, and healing—all of them with a spiritual twist. That songs like “Babalawo” and “La Perla” transform midway into drum sessions or experimental jams speaks to both the group’s frenetic energy and their willingness to break free of constraints and escape into safe, healing spaces. The music doesn’t dictate where you go, your body does, and these detours are a way to ignore the norm and dance with abandon. Nothing better encapsulates that ethos than “Memoria,” a song that can best be described as wonder and chaos in crescendo—a  an exorcism of sorts. The track begins with a lo-fi, old-school sample of a noir soundtrack then morphs into a slow, trip-hop beat, which clears a path for Olivero’s powerful voice. She sings cautiously about the memories of the body—“ ”—until the song climaxes into a cumbia sung by an ominous, distorted, mocking voice from an afterlife: “You don’t escape; you transform,” it sings in Spanish with a hearty laugh. Not even in death can you escape from the sins of the body, it seems to say; but death, while unforgiving, brings a transformation that absolves. The tension that manifests throughout the record—happiness and despair, life and death, spirit and body—reflects the period in which it was written and composed: In 2020, amidst a global pandemic, an exploding Black Lives Matter movement, and during recording sessions in Puerto Rico. The last part made the group aware of the suffocating realities of living in a U.S. colony, and gave them a palette to create an entrancing visual narrative that interpolates ritual and art. It’s also an inherently queer album; its lyrics explore sexuality, and an accompanying   provides a stage for trans and queer performance artists and artists of color to interpret Combo Chimbita’s songs. Harvesting the power of communal creation in times of chaos,  offers us a cleansing balance between peace and turmoil, and a spiritual template to deal with the impending storms coming our way.", "genre": ["Latin"]}

And that may not cover all of Donaldson’s output. Who knows? The guy is  . He’s also remarkably consistent, at least within the RP&Ps universe. The project’s downcast pop songs are written and recorded entirely in Donaldson’s San Francisco home.   is his fourth RP&Ps album in less than three years, and, not surprisingly, it is every bit as lovely as its predecessors. It’s a master class in doing more with less. Invariably, RP&Ps songs are built from Donaldson’s winsome vocal melodies, his sigh of a singing voice, restrained rhythm sections, gently played guitars (of the jangling electric and/or strummed acoustic variety) and, often, the soft glow of a keyboard or synth. In less capable hands, this is a mix that might grow tiresome after a while, but Donaldson uses the limits of the sound to his advantage by weaving an almost narcotic instrumental foundation that complements and enhances his gifts as a tunesmith and a storyteller. As a result, when he yawns his way through these lines in “Pour the Light In,” the effect is not devastating, but nostalgic and comforting: “Without love, the rest is sorrow/ ‘Til death will come in/ The grave’s a veil over paradise/ I’ve laid too long in what dreams were buried/ And did not grow here.” Donaldson has a knack for capturing universal feelings in interesting ways. “The air got colder in the room when you let me go,” he sings in “Let’s Pretend We’re Not in Love,” a pitch-perfect slice of melancholy indie pop. Later, in one of the album’s best choruses, he describes disillusionment as “feeling upside down in an empty room,” which feels strangely accurate. He also takes two opportunities here to play with the RP&Ps form a bit, producing a seven-minute-long lazy river of guitar chimes and tendrils on the title track and a pretty instrumental march embossed with a keyboard part that’s reedy, wheezing and wonderful (“Dahlias and Rain”).

She dubbed the feeling (and her new project) “Artsick,” recruiting Bay Area indie pop mainstays Mario Hernandez ( ) and Donna McKean ( ) to help concoct a back-to-basics antidote.   is the trio’s first full-length outing; an ode to the fuzzy power-pop roots of their own label,  , as well as the shambling punk put-out by northern neighbors   in the mid ’90s. Peeling back some of Burnt Palms’s grungy dissonance to make room for melody, Riley’s   material takes pages from the  . Her endearingly detached vocal takes are layered and drenched in Spectorian reverb, stretching out comfortably over casual chord changes. The tempos are brisk and the low end hits hard, but Riley’s presence within the mix feels comfy and confident. She invites the listener to share in the joy of making art for art’s sake, beating musician’s block through sheer gusto. The optimistic sound of   is a cunning disguise for Riley’s acerbic lyricism. Lead single “Despise” is a sing-song middle finger to its unnamed subject. “You’re just a waste of my time/ A fake person in my life,” she sings over power chords and handclaps. As the song’s video, in which Artsick throw darts at the pencil-sketched faces of their enemies, suggests, it’s meant to be something of an anthem; a punching bag to project your own anger onto. “Stress Bomb” also channels catharsis through simple pop structure, its exuberant chorus arriving like a sigh of relief. The themes Riley tackles might be a bit more grown up than those of forebears like   and  , but her raw sincerity is a salve against world-weariness.

Nor could you necessarily guess how it sounds by looking at her   overflowing with tight loops of script draped over winged skulls and playing card motifs. The record is neither dense nor especially florid, and nothing about it indicates crossing great distances, sparing a single mention of St. Basil’s Cathedral. Instead,   is remarkably steady and self-contained, adhering to ambling rhythms and cotton-soft melodies tapped out on an ever-present ’70s synth-organ hybrid—a  , for the gearheads. Still the record’s nostalgic softness doesn’t exist for its own sake. La Puerta, former member of “medieval country” outfit  , uses that aesthetic to explore a lyrical sensibility that feels both oblique and intimate, and like   Dan Bejar before her, she draws surreal couplets that seem loaded with meaning, however unplaceable. Amidst the tiki lounge samba of “Everyone Knows” is “A bright star on a sunny day/ A young prophet with nothing to say, no thank you.” The vividness of her imagery is the star here, helped along by the restraint of her sonic palette. La Puerta is inclined towards the philosophical and the literary. Album standout “Chocolate Cake” proffers a clever Edgar Allen Poe reference—“He was the pit and pendulum, baby/ Swinging back and forth between no and maybe”—within the breathy narrative of a disappointing and possibly abusive lover. It makes for an artful pose of feminine defeat, recognizable to anyone with a passing familiarity of Lana Del Rey. Not unlike the Baldwin Fun Machine upon which it was built,   is something of a sonic curio; it rewards close contemplation. But it’s also beautiful in the background, just catching your eye each time you look up from across the room.", "genre": ["Pop"]}

The gauzy beats sparkle beneath his breathy, tenor voice, giving way and tightening to induce precise moments of heartbreak.

The Chicago-based composer might be the first to make a whole album out of the experience, though. Regularly using mushrooms while listening to sounds, she found herself drawn toward “low tonal patterns,” inspiring her to build new pieces around bass lines played on her Korg synthesizer. Adding layers with tapes, field recordings, and a Mellotron, she turned her own grappling with Covid isolation into a kind of imaginary sci-fi soundtrack. The result,  , certainly provokes intense feelings of seclusion. Take “Laika,” where foamy waves of static evoke an empty beach in winter, and dramatic, string-like swells could score a mental breakdown. But there are many other relatable emotions conjured by Block’s dense, ever-changing tracks. The pulsing rhythm of “En Echelon” suggests persistence in the face of danger, while the bright, soaring tones of “Through Houses” spray sonic light into the album’s dark tunnel. Throughout, Block’s bass patterns reappear in different forms, grounding her kaleidoscopic explorations and showing vividly how disorienting experiences can be made sense of through art.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

The album became an underground hit thanks to Dawuna’s masterful musical fusion: genres pioneered by Black musicians—like gospel, soul, R&B, and dance—seamlessly intertwine with darker ambient sounds and liquid synths to create an otherworldly soundscape where religious existentialism and freedom from societal and racial oppression provide a path for personal salvation. Remastered and re-released this month by   the record opens with “The Ape Prince,” a track bolstered by bulbous bass and liquid percussion, making it sound as if the song had been recorded underwater. The echoing instrumentation works in contrast to Dawuna’s melodious and melancholic croon. It’s an arresting opening to an album that’s an emotional rollercoaster, its tracks constantly morphing and snaking their way into different stories. “The Lighthouse” toes the line between lo-fi gospel and sensuality, and “The General” uses a whirlwind of ambient sounds, ominous piano, and staccato percussion to tell the story of wayward police chief with outsized visions of grandeur and an unshakable attachment to his gun: “Banana clip always at the tip of the tongue,” Dawuna sings softly in one of the album’s most unflinching lyrics. is an album that floors with its genius and grounds with its intent.

According to Paris-based producer/consummate storyteller Emeric “Hollywood Burns” Levardon, “a small faction of humans have escaped the terror in the sky” and been left to wander a “post-apocalyptic wasteland” like they’re living in the worst space opera imaginable. Much like a manic video game, we’ve been dropped right in their moon boots, so that we can watch every last scene unfold firsthand. That includes everything from the disturbing combat sequences of “Saturday Night Screamer”—complete with merciless aliens claiming “we are your friends”—to the ominous string arrangements of “Once Upon a Time (in Hell).” This is where Levardon sets himself apart from other stars of the synthwave set; while there’s elements of ’80s music within his work (effervescent electro and raucous arena rock, mostly), along with a little funk and disco, he’s a film composer at heart. Never mind the fact that his movies will never get made. In the Hollywood Burns universe, epic battles and expositions fly by our eyes and ears the way dynamic radio dramas once did, igniting our imagination with nothing but widescreen sound waves. It’s no wonder why Levardon’s biggest hero is popcorn movie pioneer John Williams, the iconic composer who’s as much a part of Hollywood’s biggest hits ( ,  ,  ,  ) as the images themselves.   has one other trick up its sleeve, too: symphonic metal singer Jerome Joffray, who channels Hollywood Burns’s love of Dimmu Borgir on the over-the-top single “Skylords.” Apparently, it’s about “a guy who tries to convince his girlfriend to be abducted by aliens together, because he thinks they’re gods.” Because why not right?

{"album": "This New Heaven", "artist": "Fine Place", "description": "More than just a mere side project, the self-assured debut from Fine Place sounds like the album   has been threatening to make for nearly a decade now. It started with her solo breakthrough  , a stone-cold stunner that shook off the shackles of Rose’s previous bands ( ,  ,  ) with confidence and a clear vision: melancholic rock music that doesn’t   on reverb and mood-altering melodies so much as bathe in them. Now in the company of worthy creative foil Matthew Hord ( ,  ,  ), Fine Place have given us a record that’s both gorgeous and gloomy, poppy, and poisonous. Written and recorded within the couple’s Brooklyn home during New York’s surreal lockdown,  is what happens when the streets are empty. This pervasive sense of dread makes its presence known right from the wobbly opening notes of “I Can’t Shake It,” a cut that initially comes off like one of the ambient-ish tracks from Nine Inch Nails’s  series. But then Rose steps in, singing into a red sea like a cursed siren, and it quickly becomes clear that we’re not in a warm dream pop realm—we’re in a cold waking nightmare. The album’s next two numbers build upon that brittle foundation beautifully, diving straight into the unknown as Hord’s heady, minor-keyed hooks hang across the backdrop and Rose insists, “I am fine…Just don’t fall asleep.” Comparisons to The Cure and  —two of the duo’s admitted influences—are fair, but fail to capture the potential Fine Place exudes in just eight songs and 35 minutes. In many ways, they’re the perfect bridge in between Rose’s increasingly electronic and experimental solo work, and the record she’s already in the middle of wrapping for next year ( , something she   on a tour that featured a new power trio and a largely atmospheric live show). It also reflects a universal feeling of terror and intrigue over a future that isn’t fixed, and a door that’s quickly closing. In fact, it may already be shut.

Such is the case with British singer/songwriter  , who allies himself with freaky Finland pranksters   for  . Dawson’s been delivering his weird-uncle missives from the UK avant-folk underground since 2005, mostly framing his eccentric observations with Cubist acoustic guitar accompaniment, like an unplugged Captain Beefheart with a Kingsley Amis preoccupation. He tried out some rock band arrangements on his previous album,  , but   (loosely, Finnish for “spirit”), is a full-on collaboration between Dawson and Circle. Their chief commonality seems to be a passion for messing with people’s heads. The whimsical Finns currently call themselves a metal band, but their twisty history includes everything from psychedelia to electro-experimentalism, and they don’t confine themselves to headbanging here. Circle works up an ominous art-rock waltz on “Cooksonia,” where Dawson gives a first-person account of the life of Australian botanist Isabel Clifton Cookson, for whom the extinct plant of the song’s title is named. The singer’s sandpapery tone and freewheeling phrasing suggest Robert Wyatt smoking a blunt while poring over a biology encyclopedia. The band works its way up to a Judas Priest-worthy frenzy on tracks like “Methuselah” while Dawson sings of geographic researcher Donald Currey’s 1960s work with bristlecone pines. But across  , Circle dips into pulsing, sequencer-friendly post-rock (“Silene”), a Neu-indebted krautrock feel (“Silphium”), and more. And as eccentric as the subjects may seem, Dawson manages to make it all grist for his potent poetic mill. Whatever the musical mode, the band mostly locks Dawson into relatively conventional structures and rhythms—a drastic change from earlier albums where the band-less troubadour was free to wander unfettered. Add in the prevalence of crashing power chords and   has Dawson punching in a whole new weight class.", "genre": ["Rock"]}

Hiromi Moritani—before taking on the name  —flew to London to see the Sex Pistols play live in 1977 when she was 17, and was inspired to start her own punk band. “I realized this was not something you were supposed to watch,” she told   “It was something you were supposed to do.” Once back home in Japan, she wasted no time searching for bandmates, sticking up flyers in every music joint around Osaka. Through mutual friends Moritani was linked up with a girl that went by the name Bikke, who would become the guitarist for the newly minted group. They got their start playing covers of The Who and The Ramones at amateur  , but quickly decided to change course when they saw other bands playing the same songs. “I realized Aunt Sally couldn’t go on the same way,” Moritani said. She began writing her own material, holding fast to the punk spirit but forging an identity all her own on their 1979  , now back in print after nearly four decades. Anarchy in Osaka, as it turned out, wouldn’t resemble the UK variety very much. Aunt Sally’s sound is deceptively simple, but with a razor sharp edge. “Kagami” appropriates the American big band jazz standard “Heart and Soul,” but the groove is torn to shreds with Bikke’s high-pitched, buzzed-out guitar, sounding like a circular saw cranked up to max speed. Moritani’s low, singsongy vocal is nearly completely drowned out. “Sameta Kajiba De” is even more jarring, pairing a waltz-time melody with cavernous, echoey drumming and keyboards that shimmer like faint constellations. Here, Moritani’s voice bears more weight, each syllable carrying the gravity of its own punctuation mark. There’s even a  -adjacent dirge in “Loreley” that slowly ratchets up the anxiety, culminating in a hellish dismantling of the children’s nursery rhyme “Frère Jacques,” with Moritani wailing like a vengeful spirit. It’s a potent reminder that punk can be whatever the fuck you want it to be. “It was very important to me to release an album while the punk thing was still happening in London,” Moritani explained. The group’s genre-bending debut arrived in the spring of 1979, but Aunt Sally would flame out by the summer, having already served their purpose. “Shortly after Aunt Sally formed, The Pistols broke up, and by the time we released the album, the momentum was gone because for me punk was The Pistols.” Moritani may have stopped making punk music when she went solo and rebranded as Phew, but she never stopped being punk during her more than  , uncompromisingly going her own way and never following anyone else’s lead.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"]}
{"album": "Ritmo Fantasia: Balearic Spanish Synth​-​Po", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "The island of Ibiza has changed hands plenty of times over the centuries. First founded by the Carthaginians, by 70 AD it was under the Roman Empire, before being usurped by Byzantine, Muslim, Catalan, and other powers, until ultimately falling under Spanish rule. But every summer, its beaches and clubs get raided by international revelers, and any history about Balearic music is generally overshadowed by the British DJs who exported that sound worldwide ( ,  , Danny Rampling). So on one hand, the compilation   is a fascinating set of rarely heard “Balearica”: stylish, effervescent, un-slottable, and deeply danceable. But it’s also a necessary corrective, an immersive 21-track set showing how Spanish speaking artists embodied the cosmopolitan spirit of the island without needing validation from tourists or off the island. Compiler/DJ Andres Astorga, aka Trujillo, dug exhaustively for album deep cuts, one-hit wonders, and leftfield remixes that shake off easy categorization, while embracing the island’s “anything goes” ethos. You’ll hear new age pipes, smooth jazz sax, the samba setting on old synths, Spanish guitar runs, robotic refrains, dripping rainforest samples, and pounding 808s, all in peculiar proportions. Ma Ritter’s “Flamenco Rap” is exactly that: a mash of furious strums, dewdrop synths, and a peculiar rap plunked right in the middle of it. Zas’s “I Love My Body” pairs self-love to a sensuous bass throb and laser pulses while Tango?’s own “Tango?” appears to answer its own question with an oddly dramatic slow-boogie number. Scan Man’s one-off “Arabian” wraps together electro, silky R&B, and hip-hop thanks to the timbre of a synth set to “oud.” It all builds to a sweaty house number like “Tabu (Caribbean Dub),” which captures in sound what an Ibiza vacation feels like: languid daydreams melting into nights lost in rapture on the dancefloor.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Sturino turned 30 during the pandemic, and her lyrics are fixated on the shifting sense of self that so often comes with hitting that milestone. She reevaluates toxic friendships (“Everything Is Better”), questions her chosen life path (“Quitter”), wrestles with apathy (“Tunnels”), and reflects on past mistakes (“25th”). “Honestly, I’ve just been working/ Trying to find something important I won’t fuck up for myself,” she sings on the album’s dramatic closing track, “Point of Interest.” Her exquisitely crafted indie rock sure feels like that something. Weakened Friends are devoted to the blown-out yet tuneful side of ’90s alt-rock. On  , they augment loud/soft dynamics with squiggles of expressionistic lead guitar and huge, sugary hooks. They have clear antecedents in bands like Veruca Salt, the Breeders, and  , whose J. Mascis lent a towering guitar solo to their  . Nirvana’s shadow also looms large—the “hey, wait” that opens the chorus of “Quitter” feels like a deliberate nod to “Heart-Shaped Box.” Sturino’s voice even occasionally recalls Alanis Morrissette’s, another idiosyncratic singer whose pitchy yelping and penchant for sucking in breath mid-lyric belied her astonishing power and control. It’s the vividness of Weakened Friends’ music that distinguishes them from the glut of current bands playing ’90s-inspired indie. The cutting specificity of Sturino’s lyrics is matched by the laser-guided precision of the hooks she uses to deliver them, and the crisp, full-bodied production job by bassist Annie Hoffman renders the songs in vibrant color.

She continues to wander wherever sounds beckon on new album  , exploring spaces between the acoustic and electronic, fantasy and reality, imagination and memory. “Celestial Ether” opens the record as a statement of intent, its first few seconds introducing Kedrina’s staggering, otherworldly falsetto only to puncture it with loaded stabs of bass. A bell melody ticks overhead, drums are injected into the stream, and the formless begins to take shape. This potential courses through the album, with Kedrina’s cold voice that freezes moments and stops time counterbalanced by the dark euphoria of music that threatens to burst into blistering breakbeats as soon as the world resumes its rotation. On “Your Turn” it manifests as 2-step/garage, while “Teardrop” channels trance and “Boy” sits over on the Smashing Pumpkins side of things. A meditation on an impossible relationship, “Boy” also happens to be one of the first songs Kedrina has written in English. Its sepia-flushed mix of band instrumentation (rather than purely digital textures) stands out in contrast to other highlights such as “My Invisible,” an urgent electronic cut on which Kedrina takes the role of IDM diva. Its lyrics echo the moods of the rest of the album: nebulous, cosmic, and elemental. These themes culminate in the album’s closing chapters, where beats are cast aside for even more distorted and intoxicating vocals and synths. There is so much energy and wonder imbued in the songs of   that the record couldn’t sit still if it tried.

As opener “Bad Bet” revs up to speed, Black Dice lock into an unrelenting groove that, throughout the course of   never lets up, even as it unspools and distends. With the aid of producer Rustie Santos, every song hits the chaotic euphoria of their live shows, where they can reduce an audience to a throbbing mass of flesh, in ways previous albums like   and  only nailed in fits and starts. “Jocko”, “Swinging” and “Tuned Out” ride propulsive rhythms while creating ear-tickling hooks out of power-drill electronics. The most unhinged risks produce the catchiest tracks—like lead single “White Sugar,” which slams together cowbell and a lead guitar obliterated by distortion, or the hip-hop inflected “Big Chip” with its tumble of garbled vocals. What’s just as exciting, but much easier to miss, are the startling trio of quieter tracks titled “Scramblehead.” These brief bits of connective tissue subtly and effectively pace the album, holding the guts together, while hitting a dazed beauty the band hasn’t tapped into since the gentle oddities of 2004’s  . The album ends on one of those tracks, and in the seconds before it abruptly cuts to silence, my sense of chronology with this band seemed to evaporate entirely.

It even has an interlude in which musicians Gira Dahnee and (frequent Gay collaborator)   perform what sounds like a step routine on “S’phisticated Lady” (no relation to Ellington’s song). Still, there’s a definite current running throughout the album: strong, danceable rhythms. The opening “Sometimes I Forget How Summer Looks on You” is a menacing pop song on its surface, but it has a churning polyrhythm underneath—complex, busy, yet with a contagious sense of movement. “Oh Great Be the Lake” has Native-American-flavored percussion; “Nyuzura” and “Lean Back Try Igbo” draw from East and West Africa, respectively. “Aunt Lola and the Quail” is a combination of all of it: organic and electronic percussion; tribal chants; cornet; Rob Frye’s flute; and strings. All of it makes the listener move differently, but all of it makes the listener  . The point, Gay says, is to engage with day-to-day routine and information overload as rhythmic concepts.

On sophomore album  , West’s approach was to start from within and look outward; she sought to make sense of a bout with addiction, feelings of insecurity, and the grief of a lost loved one by checking the temperature of her surroundings. By investigating the results of her decisions, the hope was to arrive at a conclusion about why she made those choices.   subverts that process, instead looking at snapshots of the self in a series of moments—an analysis of how West presents herself, and how that presentation might be perceived by someone else. “I want to look right into the camera,” West sings on opening track “Lava,” and it’s a potent metaphor; you can strike your best pose, but the picture that results is unpredictable. You’re at the mercy of how the light hits you, and how the photographer frames the shot.

{"album": "Back Up: Mexican Tecno Pop 1980–1989", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": " is the latest compilation from San Francisco label  , giving new life (and death) to eerie deep cuts of Mexican goth, post-punk, and new wave. The collection is an impressive glimpse at synth-driven sounds that flourished at a time when rock ‘n’ roll and other youth subcultures were persecuted by government officials, turned bleaker by political turmoil, economic uncertainty, and the 1985 earthquake that devastated Mexico City. “Alfabeto,” by  , is a pitch-black prayer for the words, ideas, and lives stolen from that generation, while El Escuadrón del Ritmo’s “Las Cucarachas” morphs from a surreal tale of roach infestation into a droning, chilling metaphor for citizen paranoia. For  , the team at Dark Entries cherry-picked a 2005 CD-only compilation of the same name, adding previously unreleased tracks and pressing it on vinyl for the first time. Openers “Pesadillas,” by Avant Garde, and “Cambios en el Tiempo,” by Vandana, layer spectral synths over punchy drum machines, setting the tone for campy dance-offs to come. While many parallels to British goth and German ambient can be drawn, the influential work of Carlos Robledo and his trailblazing projects   and Casino Shanghai is also clear throughout, particularly on the vaporwave-esque “Cou Cou Bazar.” Perhaps  ’s greatest achievement is the tolling of a bell that celebrates these artists as pioneers of a new Mexican sound, unfolding in parallel—if not ahead—of future global pop trends. The brittle percussion of Artefacto’s “Mundo Sin Viento” is a kindred spirit to Information Society’s mid-‘80s classic “ ,” while a sense of premonition threads through the bubblegum whimsy of Volti’s “Corazón,” practically foretelling the advent of Latin Freestyle on the U.S. East Coast.", "genre": ["Alternative", "goth", "electro pop"]}

The L.A.-based musician lost his mother to cancer while wildfires destroyed homes and property around him. On his striking debut,  , he brings listeners into both of those traumatic experiences. Brenner writes in an observational style, using the California wildfires as a symbol for all-consuming loss. On opener “Brushfire” he sings, “Watch homes turn into flames/ Wonder if my body is burning up/ In a room, I lay awake.” On “Cul-de-sac,” he drifts by diners and meets his doppelgänger. His lyrics reflect the various stages of grief that accompany death and destruction—shock, denial, detachment, surrender, and eventual acceptance. His powerful voice—at times reaching operatic levels, other times echoing like a choir—enhance the album’s mournful, pensive atmosphere. Unable to be by his mother’s side in her final days, he welcomes her love from beyond on the plaintive piano track, “Spirit”: “You’re gone/ You’re gone/ I am not scared to be watched.” He threads the sound of fire into the closing moments of “Over My Head,” allowing the sound of the flickering flames to carve a path forward.  is a vulnerable, raw exploration of grief spoken from—and aimed toward—the heart.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

But in a unique time of so many compounding sorrows, such a layered word feels right. Constructed from recordings shared with collaborators across the globe during lockdown,   is an intimate album of orchestral proportions and the most ambitious release of Jerusalem In My Heart’s long career. Each of these tracks features a different collaborator. While that can often be challenging to hold together as an album,  ’s power is only amplified by its large cast. There’s a genuine sense that each of these artists are bringing their own concerns and strengths to the table. “Situated between the cracks of a broken tomorrow/ I worry,” intones   on “Qalaq 3,” part of the title suite stretching half the album. Percussionists   and   contribute blast beats and finger drumming,   and  ’s Roger Tellier-Craig scramble sounds, while   and legendary Canadian filmmaker, singer, and First Nations activist   deliver haunting vocals. Absorbing passages of   (like “Istashraqtaq,” with Beirut) are reminiscent of early Jerusalem in My Heart, but Moumneh mostly embraces the unknown here, finding a brief beautiful respite in “Qalaq 5” and chaos in the abrupt closing sound collage “Qalaq 9.” Moumneh offers no release to this deep worry in the end, but Jerusalem In My Heart has never been interested in simple catharsis.

{"album": "City of Mirrors", "artist": "Dos Santos", "description": ", the fourth studio album from beloved Chicago five-piece Dos Santos, is a sweeping epic of Latin American rhythms and borderland poetry. Conceived while on tour and recorded between Los Angeles and Chicago, the album is a loving melange of tradition, spirituality, and odes to a Latinx diaspora in constant conflict. Dos Santos infuse musical proficiency with sober themes, like migration, on “Lejos de Ti” and the title track; narrating the broken embraces of loved ones left behind and the lonely exercise of sprouting roots in a new city. The barreling percussion and driving rhythm guitars of “Cages and Palaces” carry an even harsher message: “No hay salvación dentro de aquí” (“There is no salvation in here”). On the song, singer Alex Chavez astutely alludes to both the gilded cages undocumented immigrants exist within—in the heart of empire, but with restrictions and fear always looming—and the literal cages in which our government is still placing them. While Dos Santos are unafraid of taking challenging looks at the Latinx experience,   is far from a tale of woe. “A Shot in The Dark” opens the record on layered chants and a minimalist drum that harken to ancestral rituals tethering us to homelands not forgotten. The spaghetti western-influenced “Alma Cósmica” speaks of soulful transcendence over chicha guitars and hypnotic percussion certain to spark a thousand dance circles. Finally, euphoric cuts “Palo Santo” and “Crown Me” take atmospheric cues from prog-rock, expanding Dos Santos’s already dizzying sonic arsenal and feeding their voracious curiosity for fresh intersections of tradition and innovation.", "genre": ["Jazz", "latin jazz"]}

The Munich quartet   has mined that vintage era of spiritual jazz and shaded it with vocals, bop, and hip-hop over the course of three albums and a recent pair of remix albums. With  , they’ve added Max Herre who is perhaps best known as a rapper, but the composer, musician, and producer, who is responsible for various keyboards, electronics, and production on the record, is crucial to its overall ambiance.

The 79-year old trumpeter   emerges from the swelling bop harmony that opens “Intersections” with some spacious echoes and then turns up the heat, leading to some  -esque piano from Web Web’s Roberto di Gioia, with furious drums from Peter Gall and another guest, harpist  , filling the mix. Elsewhere on the album, Younger evokes quietude with hypnotic strums on the well-named “Satori Ways.” “Meskel Flowers,” features another inspired guest, Ethio-jazz founder and vibraphonist  , who dances his mallets along the pentatonic scale, blessed with Herre’s most pronounced effects (from quirky to neo-industrial), and alongside the flute of Web Web’s Tony Lakatos, and a varied swath of percussion. They summon the spirit of ‘70s jazz with the ululating East Indian grooves that tinge “Liberation March,” and the cheesy-cool organ, flute, and bottle percussion that give the tone poem “Turquoise” a throwback vibe.  closes with a flurry: The dynamic mix of breathy flute, metallic keys, and in-the-pocket drums and bass that make “Whirlin’” feel like a template for some freestyle rap along the lines of what   once set up for Gil Scott-Heron; then “The Sequel,” the most straight-ahead jazz of the set, with a dash of brass fanfares occasionally sparkling to the fore.

{"album": "Everything", "artist": "Bnny", "description": "The musical touchstones of  ’s debut LP,  , are predominantly post-‘60s garage and the sadder side of ‘90s indie, maybe some meditative 2010s ambient. Its central theme—death—is slightly older. Making music about death has a fair amount of precedent. There’s   and  , “Candle in the Wind” (first written for Marilyn Monroe, then rewritten for Diana), and Pink Floyd’s “Shine On You Crazy Diamond.” There’s second-line brass bands, baroque requiems, and Gregorian chants from the Middle Ages. There’s evidence of funerary music stretching back to Ancient Egypt and images of lute players inside their tombs. So long as people keep dying, we keep singing them out. But there is no “we” in  . There is only Bnny frontwoman Jess Viscius and the notable absence left by the death of her partner, a void she leans into physically on the cover. She addresses this absence by name in a papery whisper exactly once on the record during “Dreams,” begging him to “Come to me in dreams/ Good or bad, I’ll take anything.” Grief will do that to you. Although Mazzy Star and Soko are natural reference points here,   still has its fiery side. Viscius is prone to flashes of psych-rock recklessness that mediate a shrugging nihilism, particularly on “Promises.” She’s downright combative on the garage-y “Take That Back,” claiming that she would rather not fight, but that “I just want to say you’re wrong/ And baby I’m right.” She’s shadowboxing and she knows it. She doesn’t care. It can’t last. Viscius is too deflated by grief to throw punches at someone she misses for a full album. She tends to exhaust herself before most of the songs finish, leaving the outros to the band. She’s unconcerned with specifics, singing that “you remind me of a place I used to know” and “a feeling I once had” on “Blind” without elaborating on what that place or feeling might be. She feels no need to dream up brand new metaphors for grief or death, singing instead about delicate hearts and dying flowers. If other people find that clichéd, so be it. And for the most part, other people don’t exist on  . They appear only to stupidly tell her life goes on, which she dismisses on “Thaw” (the comedown from “Take That Back”) with a simple, “Don’t they know they’re wrong?” In other words,   has no use for the living. As for the dead? He makes his presence known on 54-second closer “Voice Memo,” a hardly-even-a-demo of Viscius and a man’s voice harmonizing over acoustic guitar. Death is the end of everything, but it also has a unique power to imbue the mundane with the outsize significance of remembrance. Placed at the tail end of the album’s exasperation and sorrow, it’s a uniquely stirring moment.

Annika Henderson ( ) was a political journalist before she became a musician, and while her musings on the banality of evil in the Trump administration are not exactly original, they’re still more interesting than the #resist songs many artists of a certain age have churned out over the past few years. Even the album’s title track, a song with a saccharine message (essentially: people can change and learn from each other…and we should do that) doesn’t come off as cloying because it’s presented so elegantly. Back with her old collaborator   ( ), who co-produced the album and plays drums on every track, Anika creates welcoming synth worlds, perfect foils for her icy vocal style, while turns of phrase like “shouting around” push the lyrics out of generic territory. (Henderson gives interviews in a decidedly British accent, so it’s never been entirely clear whether her vaguely Germanic singing voice is an affect or a natural outgrowth of her German heritage and her many years spent living in Berlin.) As for the rest of the album, there are plenty of hits to offset the minor misses. Unusually, the middle third of the album is its strongest segment: The vocal acrobatics and propulsive rhythm section of “Naysayer” give way to an absolutely massive, droning synth on “Sand Witches,” underscoring monotone spoken word poetics à la  . Then, on “Never Coming Back”—the album’s catchiest track—that same synth is scaled back over traditional pop instrumentation while Anika sings about a lover she took for granted. Later, the Kim Gordon-channeling “Rights” dissolves into the synth-pop anthem “Freedom,” both of which avoid the direct political messaging their names belie. “Waiting For Something,” a slow-burning track with an acoustic feel, would fit more comfortably on an   record than an Anika album, but it closes the latest chapter in Henderson’s unorthodox musical journey with a graceful flourish nonetheless.", "genre": ["Pop", "synth pop"]}

As the title implies, the album is about finding a middle ground, and lyrically, its songs swing gracefully between the extremes—from the opulence of “Cali Dreams” (which includes a clever nod to 2Pac’s “California Love”) and “The Most Humblest of All Time, Ever” to the hushed brokenness of “Be Someone” and “Love Again.” Often, the back-and-forth occurs within the space of a single song: on the arresting opener “No Love Song,” Daley laments “Got the emotions of a stone, expecting me to write a love song,” and later, on “I Need You,” Daley sets up a ballad of romance that Kon then spikes with doubt: “Losing love, learning lifelong lessons/ …too proud to beg, to ashamed to assure you.” The interplay between the duo mirrors that same duality: Kon is a deeply emotive rapper with a distinctive, grainy voice, and on songs like “I Need You,” it acts as the perfect counterbalance to Daley’s lithe, elegant singing style. But for all of that lyrical back-and-forth, what makes the album work so well is that, musically, it’s all of a piece. Like early albums by Maxwell and  , much of   favors low-lit, jazz and R&B arrangements, leaning on prominent, cruising basslines and sparkling keys. This makes it feel not so much like a collection of songs as a single unified suite, with different movements that surge and recede. (That it’s bookended by a pair of brief pieces titled “Sunrise” and “Sunset” only amplifies this feeling.) On high points like the title track, they hit on a crackling groove that recalls the classic era of the Soulquarians. That cohesiveness gives the album depth and richness; like  ,   is an album unafraid to explore the complications that occur the deeper you get into life. That it handles them with such skill and sensitivity is a testament to the group’s sure hand.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

Russell shares the sexual exploitation she suffered at the hands of her father who, “Used me like a wife/ Mama turned a blind eye” on “4th day Prayer.” Mixing mythology, folklore, spiritual magic, and biographical details, Russell’s lyrics evoke visceral emotions. The multi-instrumentalist balances the intensity of these “violent lullabies” with acoustic guitar and banjo, grounding bleakness against the comfort of traditional folk and often selecting one instrument to shine behind her voice—like the sharp banjo pluck on “Little Rebirth” or the menacing acoustic guitar and banjo on “All of the Women.” Though   is filled with hard-earned wisdom, Russell’s profound empathy and storytelling shatters the darkness, and her unapologetic truths give space for tragedies to be transformed into triumphs.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

That’s the approach taken by the artists on  , who each offer up transformative interpretations of the Bowie songbook. Case in point is  ’s Tropicália reinvention of “Panic in Detroit” into what could be a collaboration between   and  , while brilliantly capturing Bowie’s juxtaposition of earworm melody and an undercurrent of nervous tension. Equally striking is  ’s orchestral take on “Life on Mars.” Not a word of the original lyrics are spoken; instead, the violinist channels the bold dramatics and unguarded wonder of Bowie’s grand vision into his arrangements. Some takes align themselves closely to a particular album or phase. For instance: the bright pop bounce of “Golden Years” stood out against  ’s dark atmosphere and lush soundscapes; by giving the song ambient hues and an air of heartbreak and melancholy,   reimagines it in a way that’s in line with the rest of Bowie’s 1976 release.   charts a course through “Sound and Vision” that parallels the   original, but he steers it through darker tones that mirror Bowie’s somber lyrics. Other renditions seem to imagine the way a song might’ve sounded if it had been recorded by a different Bowie persona.  ’s take on “Right” is a summery soul groove that glides along the surface of the original’s sleek melody as if bathed in the serious moonlight of   and not a byproduct of  ’s plastic soul. For  ’ “Chant of The Ever Circling Skeletal Family,”   transforms the original’s propulsive rock ‘n roll into an electronic thumper that would’ve snapped right into place on 1995’s  . And while Bowie flirted with jazz on a number of his albums,  ’ reworking of “Heroes” employs a jazz quartet that burns with a smoldering melodicism, and suggesting, perhaps, a post-  trajectory. But no track better encapsulates the album’s sweet spot between heartwarmingly familiar and brand new than  ’s adaptation of “Soul Love.” The guitarist, his New Breed ensemble, and vocalist   bring to the song a perspective so fresh that even a Bowie fan might not immediately recognize the source material; but once you identify it, you hear the original in every note.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

From  ’s Arkestra to  ’s jazz fusion outfit Catalyst to the free-funk experiments of Jamal and Byard Lancaster’s Sounds Of Liberation, this was a time when Philly was ripe with musicians playing forward-thinking, progressive jazz. With many of these acts recording for small independent labels, most records have gone out of print. This was the case with Jamal’s 1984 opus  , long considered a holy grail amongst rare jazz collectors.  ’s reissue of the highly sought-after gem puts on full display Jamal’s brilliance as an instrumentalist and bandleader. Featuring a crew of heavy hitters—  on flute and alto sax;   and   on drums; Omar Hill playing percussion; Reggie Curry on bass; Bernard Sammul handling piano duties; and Clifton Burton playing harmonica—the playing throughout the album is powerful, intuitive, and diverse. Stylistically, the album swings from the lush and optimistic Afro-Latin sound of “Nubian Queen” to the frantically-paced post-bop of “The Angry Young Man.” The album’s spiritual centerpiece is the hypnotic, Coltrane-inspired tune “The Known Unknown.” With its regal and majestic theme, as well as some truly inspired playing from Jamal and Sammul in particular, “The Known Unknown” speaks to the sheer quality of the music that Jamal and his cohort were making at the time. For many listeners,   will be a worthy introduction to Khan Jamal and his work, and this reissue will go a long way in granting us access to what was, previously, a nearly-impossible-to-acquire classic.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

By the time   was released in 1970, the tide had turned against Makeba. Following her increasingly forthright stance on Black liberation and her marriage to civil rights leader Kwame Toure (née Stokely Carmichael) in 1968, white audiences withdrew their support, the U.S. government cancelled her visa, and Reprise Records terminated her contract.   was her last album with the label, and marked her departure from the United States and a period of great change in her life. Produced by Lewis Merenstein, the album features soul covers of hits such as Van Morrison’s “Brand New Day” and “I Shall Sing,” alongside the percussion-driven “Down On The Corner,” originally by Creedence Clearwater Revival. But a more contemplative thread runs through the record, in tracks like Crosby, Stills & Nash’s “For What It’s Worth” and The Beatles’ “In My Life”—a reflection of the changes going on around her. Makeba’s original compositions tackle familiar themes: “Lumumba” honors both Congolese independence leader   and Miriam’s grandson, while the diverse influences on the funky “Ibande” and the powerful “Kulala” are reflective of Makeba’s Pan-African approach.

They’ve traded the spastic art rock of 2019 debut EP   for something more focused and more sinister. As a result,   concerns—capitalism, for one, along with the hopelessness and false illusion of freedom it fosters—are more pressing and more direct. This is a record with real enemies, among them Big Pharma, chiefly for profiting off of the opioid epidemic. No wonder the tracklist is written in all caps. This is seemingly fragmented post-punk that never loses sight of its whole. Throughout  , N0V3L operates like a machine without hierarchy; a sax takes over the kinetic guitar line, that guitar twists into a new atonal harmony, and nothing is wasted. Meaty basslines are set so high in the mix that Joy Division comparisons feel inevitable. The agile guitar work that made   so enticing is back, but it’s meaner, punching holes in melodic cohesion or John Carpenter-style synth lines. There are moments of strange clarity, never better than on “STRANGER,” which opens with a simple and enticing piano riff before a scuzzy guitar takes it over. Moments later, the rhythm shudders into gear, and the machine is driving forward once again. Taken together, the record plays like a series of manifestos. There are no preambles and no footnotes, no truly cathartic crescendos offering a moment’s release (even in songs that stretch beyond the four-minute mark).   past is a darkened country, and its present, however intolerable, feels unnameable as it slips from grasp—“Grip on the present like sand between fingers,” intones frontman Jon Varley on album closer “NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE.” Varley believes there is no future—or maybe there is a future, but it is an indifferent one, and either way, late capitalism will drag us onward by our necks. His sense of time warps, stops, and becomes space, somehow even less tangible than before. In the final moments of standout “Apath,” it splinters completely: “Rushing, slow it down/ Closed off, open up/ Avoiding, look around/ Look back, seen enough.” That’s a brave statement to make on a debut album. Equally daring is the declaration that this is “violent and paranoid music for a violent and paranoid time,” delivered with a distorted growl over a splashing snare in the opening moments of “VIOLENT & PARANOID.” But N0V3L is the kind of band that isn’t afraid to spell it out—after all, the writing is already on the wall when it comes to the ravages of late capitalism. Toiling away from inside the concrete chambers of those dark Satanic mills, so to speak, N0V3L tests the mass of its own bleakness. It swallows them whole.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"]}

In a   with  , a recently sober Hardy reflected on the painkiller-induced fuzz of the group she created with drummer Micah Calabrese in 2001, calling it “a curse.” By the time the band entered the 2010s, “It was just fucked,” Hardy said. “I started to lose my mind.” Giant Drag signed to Interscope Records and put out a single full-length, only to get dropped before they could put out a second. Calabrese kept leaving the band and rejoining just to leave again. Hardy stood in the storm alone. In the early days, fans and buzzy publications couldn’t get enough of her baby face and foul mouth onstage, and she was compared to Mazzy Star’s Hope Sandoval.

Hardy always seems a little bored, pissed that her song’s subjects thought they could come near her. On “YFLMD,” which stands for “You Fuck Like My Dad,” Hardy exhales an “Okay,” over a repeating guitar line: punchy like pitting a cherry. “I made a mistake,” she drawls before repeatedly comparing a lover to her father, with much distaste. The remastered  , too, sounds more living, flush with anxiety, indignance, and all its plumage; but it briefly lets out a gentle sigh with the achy “Heart Carl.” This acoustic track is the down coat over the remaster’s scraggly shoulders, though Hardy tries to divert from its softness just as she had done with her dick-joke-heavy stage banter. “I don’t care,” she sings, her voice nearly disappearing when she continues with “We don’t matter.” She shies from vulnerability, but not before making a sighing admission, “I never asked for this/ Does anyone ever ask for this?/ Just want somebody to reach out and kiss.” Both Giant Drag and its frontwoman are sometimes offensive, sometimes they perform energizing displays of steely human resilience. To that first point: recently, Hardy has taken to reposting Tucker Carlson videos and   COVID-19 vaccines to eugenics on Twitter.

The stunning new   is her most cogent, clear-eyed statement yet: a meditation on the different kinds of loss, none more profound than the death of the vocalist’s younger brother Maher as she was writing the songs for her third album. Yet the seven pieces never feel funereal or pessimistic, thanks to the inherent airiness in her crystalline voice, and the clarity of the arrangements. The results are ethereal, but never shapeless or anodyne. The music builds on the song-oriented material from her 2014 debut  —her 2018 album   pushed toward drifty ambient music—but with a much sharper focus and command of her materials. Aftab employs classic Urdu lyrics from traditional Pakistani ghazals—such as “Mohabbat,” where she laments a romantic rejection singing, “The sadness of this is equal to the sadness of all the world.” She eschews traditional instrumentation—although her elongated, slithering phrases sometimes recall Pakistani folk—working instead with a superb cast of musicians fluent in jazz, contemporary classical music, and folk, allowing her gorgeously meditative voice to drift amid Jamey Haddad’s percolating hand percussion, a lattice of arpeggios articulated by Gyan Riley’s resonant acoustic guitar, and Maeve Gilchrist’s sparkling harp, all of them accented by the tender smears of Nadje Noordhuis’ trumpet, the ethereal twinkles of Shahzad Ismaily’s synth, and the ambient swells of Darian Donovan Thomas’ violin. As she does throughout the album Aftab transforms suffering into rhapsodic beauty with her exquisite, elastic phrasing, translating pain into acceptance as each song unfolds. The guitar playing of Badi Asad gives “Diya Hai,” another rumination on lost love, a forlorn quality, with each phrase answered by elegant string arrangements played by the quartet Rootstock Republic. Aftab’s adaptation of the Rumi poem on “Last Night” employs a surprising reggae setting, but her beautifully measured singing prevents the stylistic pivot from sounding out-of-place.

The Australian band was only around for four years, but   puts their rarity in full view, like watching a butterfly perch on your watering can. Although very much made by children, the songs on   are in no way kid’s music. They offer complex interpretations of jangle pop and sunny psych rock, with sometimes-shrill-but-always-vibrant vocals delivering purposefully hackneyed one-liners like “turn my digital dial with your beautiful smile.” That line, which serves as the chorus on the titular song “Turn My Dial,” comes in after two lovers allow each other to “suck an egg, break a leg,” as long as he doesn’t break her “Chinese scone,” too. Coming from Tangled Shoelaces’ mouths and hands, music feels like one big, happy joke. On acoustic pseudo-sea-shanty “On The Sea,” the band laughs while delivering delicate three-part harmonies, giggling as they offer to “hide away in secrecy, just you and me.” On the twinkly “Giant Rabbits,” Stephen Mackerras is the solemn voice for, you guessed it, a giant rabbit, who struggles with this “society of illusion,” noticing how “someone help me” is “such an empty expression.” It’s a profound observation, especially for a giant rabbit, and reveals that underneath their jokes, the band tried to make sense of difficult emotions.

Feeling burned out, she returned home to Louisiana, reclaiming her New Orleans roots and absorbing the music of the region into her songs on 2019’s  . That theme continues on  , where footwork, R&B, lush house, hard bounce percussion, and Detroit techno provide the backdrop to the story of an android named King Creole, and her journey through art, love, history, and the music industry. The album is broken up by samples of recorded interviews with Richards’ mother, who speaks about her history in New Orleans and her life as a Creole woman. These recordings lend added gravity to Richards’ narrative of struggle, perseverance and, ultimately, acceptance through love and art. Album opener “King Creole (Intro)” is a house number with rolling percussion, where Richards details a kind of mission statement for the album: “The blueprint is me,” she says, “I am the genre.” Both statements are true; Richards cycles through lush pop/R&B (“Boomerang”), techno (“Bussifame”), bounce (“Pilot [a lude]”), funk (“Voodoo [intermission]”), and classical piano with both confidence and ease.

Mora leads from the rear like other great drummers and bandleaders—Max Roach, Idris Muhammad, Buddy Rich—but rather than showcase chops, his intent throughout is to show how African rhythms have infiltrated “New World” forms, be it Brazilian, Haitian, Caribbean, or American music.

Nayar has created music that is as expansive as it is intimate, having transformed the sounds of organic instruments like the guitar, violin, and voice into soothing and sometimes unrecognizable samples and chopped-up loops meant to represent feelings that cannot be described with words.  opens with “The Trembling of Glass,” which begins with a cascading sample of a guitar that sounds like the twinkling keys of an electric piano, underscored by a soaring synth line. Throughout the song,  Nayar masterfully bends that sample into glitches that abruptly stop and restart until they return to their original form: arpeggiated chords that instill a sense of wonder and delight. “Losing Too Is Still Ours” follows similar patterns to very different effects. With its melodious but harsh vocalizations running parallel but obscured by a dominating synth line and a muddled violin, the track sounds eerie and nostalgic, meant to convey feelings of absence and loss. Nayar is also adept at gently—yet strongly—holding listeners’ attention, with the trio of tracks “Marigolds & Tulsi,” “The Edges,” and “New Strands.” The first soars with sweet, luscious synth lines; guitar samples with heavy reverb; and a magnificent use of empty space; while “The Edges” makes use of almost ghostly choirs and glitches to break continuity. “New Strands” brings us back, with a crisper sound. With  Nayar creates magnificent music full of abstract memories and synthesized, manipulated sounds that function as a two-way mirror—a place where both Nayar and her audience can explore themselves and their relationships with one another.", "genre": ["Ambient", "Electronic"]}

For one thing, it’s a debut album called “Number One.” For another, it opens with “Gem,” a six-minute personal statement and absorbing descent into dark disco digitalism — depths the remainder of the record will spend mining. In the mylar-lined   for the song, Bezic haphazardly cycles through possible personae under her phone’s mirrored gaze: suited #girlboss, blue collar caricature, suburban mom with hair curlers, wannabe influencer in Adidas track pants and tiny glasses. “Honey I know that modern life is a drag/ But you can choose a you that never feels bad,” she promises herself beneath layers of sticky lip gloss and clumpy mascara. Internet-ified solipsism permeates everything; Jane Inc is ultimately performing selfhood for herself, and she simultaneously delineates and does away with the boundary between personhood and persona: “You’re the artist and I’m your greatest piece.” It can border on grotesque.   sense of glamour is akin, perhaps, to artist Marilyn Minter’s  . It’s maximalist and unwieldy; Bezic spends a not-insignificant amount of the album’s 30 minutes doing everything at once, firing off bizarre sounds and taking melodic detours across four lanes of synth-scuzz traffic. On “Steel,” she braids punchy neo-psych guitarwork into an anxiety-inducing “Work hard all day/ Work hard no play” chant. When she comes up for air on the sparser “Faceless, Bodiless,” she defers to Jane Fonda, sampling a line from the 1971 crime thriller   in which Fonda plays a call girl caught up in a missing persons case: “What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.” In other words, if you can’t perfect the performance, you can always disappear completely. As Jane Inc, Bezic flirts with anonymity through obfuscation rather than absence. Piles of synths regularly smudge the finer contours of her voice. Nevertheless Bezic seems to have a complicated relationship with her own disappearance. “My hands are filled with dirt/ I’m clawing at the earth,” she sings in “Dirt and the Earth,” the synth strain reminiscent of Charlotte Gainsbourg’s darker ventures. Yet on album finale (and standout) “Obliterated,” she cries out to God from beneath the “speeding wave of information” and its attendant pop flourish. Jane Inc is everywhere and nowhere, and  , self-contained in its self-construction, stands alone—a monolith worthy of its name.", "genre": []}

There’s a Dalmatian with a smiling, shrunken face; a banana; and a daydreamy rendering of California’s much-beloved, now shuttered, bowling alley Albany Bowl. That last one might lead you to believe that Fake Fruit is a California band, and you’d be right—sort of. Vocalist and guitarist Hannah D’Amato brought the Fake Fruit band name with her when she moved from New York to Vancouver and eventually, to San Francisco, playing focused post-punk shows along the way. But although the band’s location and most of its roster have both changed since their first show in 2017, Fake Fruit sounds just as incisive and delightfully sour as the band’s earlier DIY days. Fake Fruit’s songs land like a friend doing a stick-and-poke on your ankle: close, messy, a little pained. A lot of the songs find D’Amato in the thick of dissatisfaction (with life, with men, with the way she’s perceived), often accompanied by prickly drums and watery guitars that break down into sloppy, angry tears. “Yolk” is one of these songs, with D’Amato declaring that her thoughts make her sick, her guitar splashing as she grows more vexed: “He says I’m funny/ I had a bad day.” Some songs are funny in a bitter sort of way, like the sardonic “Lying Legal Horror Lawyers,” in which D’Amato facetiously invokes “men’s rights/…their plight,” wishing people would “keep the mother in mind” instead. Even the album’s softer songs have bite, like the pretty and brambled “Swing And A Miss,” where Fake Fruit sighs farewell to a failed relationship. “It was a swing and a miss,” D’Amato says, her words stinging like a descending series of puncture wounds, but “That’s alright/ You didn’t make me cum,” she clarifies, crooning. Fake Fruit have established themselves on this debut as our new no-bullshit harbingers of disgruntled punk.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"]}

Where “Chinese Rock” feels delicate, veering between a sustained cadence and turbulent free jazz, “Egypt Rock” is led by what sounds like a Spanish acoustic guitar; Reed keeps a midtempo pace on the drum kit and Wertman bows the bass in its upper register. Throughout the album, the Trio adheres to the tenets of traditional jazz structures while leaning into the unforeseen twists that come with improvised music.

{"album": "Perpetual Chaos", "artist": "Nervosa", "description": ", the fourth album by Brazilian thrash outfit  , was born in the aftermath of a lineup change that reduced the outfit to lone founding guitarist Prika Amaral early last year. Call it a blessing in disguise: this changeover prompted Amaral to enlist three veteran cohorts from around the world to record Nervosa’s strongest album yet, a vicious and catchy throwback to the genre’s heyday that addresses the social climate of today. This lineup is composed of all women—Nervosa has labeled themselves “all-female thrash” for years, and not without controversy. There’s   that metal acts ought to not foreground their genders; “female-fronted” is a sexist selling point that turns gender into a novelty. But Brazil’s culture maintains a hefty dose of chauvinism, and though the country has produced influential metal bands—Sepultura, for instance, as well as obscure acts like   and  —none have kept women in their lineups. In that context, Nervosa are upending the musical tradition they’re a part of. Amaral isn’t shy to talk about Nervosa’s struggles with sexist prejudice in interviews, and that conflict has only sharpened her songwriting:  , delivers palm-mute chugging, dexterous fretwork, and infuriated-but-intelligible vocals on every song. “Pursued by Judgment” calls out “bigots and hypocrites,” while other tracks address political corruption and the widening class divide.

{"album": "Mountains (20th Anniversary Expanded Edition)", "artist": "Mary Timony", "description": "It’s difficult to imagine a more auspicious time for  s first solo effort to be reissued. Twenty years after its initial release,   makes political our dreams of connection and fellowship amidst the depressed, isolated world of quarantine. It’s not hard to imagine “the idiots [all in] a line, marching under [a poison] moon” as members of the Trump cult attempting to overthrow what remains of democracy in the very city Timony is from. (Plans to film live performances in celebration of the reissue actually had to be rescheduled due to the chaos at the Capitol building.) Despite employing a host of unconventional instruments, there’s a bare quality to the songs—like trees exposed to an endless winter. The album was engineered by Christina Files (Swirlies,  ) in a large old building that used to be a factory, and that big, open space contributes to the record’s sense of barrenness. (The album’s intentionally out-of-tune piano, for example, was recorded in an empty elevator shaft.) Timony outlines her ambitions for the album in opening song “Dungeon Dance,” its lyrics detailing the experience of depression and the search for meaning from experience through art. In a way, it recalls Virginia Woolf, whose 1927 novel   is ultimately about its own creation—the author’s “attempt at something.” Like Woolf, Timony writes nakedly about her self-destructive tendencies: on “Painted Horses” she wishes the song would kill her, then confesses she would like to kill herself peacefully in “Valley of 1,000 Perfumes.” But even amidst the blackness of despair, Timony still seeks out the glow of creation, ultimately deciding that we must not “give [ourselves] away/ There are too many others in pain.” If   has a single unifying theme, it’s that we must stay alive for one another, and that we must   the meaning and connection we want from life. Not that creation is easy. In “The Hour Glass,” Timony wrestles with the struggle of working odd jobs while trying to survive as a touring musician. “This is the knife of life, work, and independence/ We are only free at night, but that is when we sleep.” The reissue is rounded out by new versions of four songs, which offer fresh shading and nuance. A new version of “Return to Pirates” reinforces the sense that Timony is moving towards victory over despair, singing, “I want to be in the garden of love/ Led by a lamb and a little white dove.” An orchestral version of “Valley of 1,000 Perfumes” is lush with string arrangements, and Timony’s voice is even more audible here when she insists, “Today our music doesn’t have enough style/ We’re going to run to the country from a suicide.” That line is a reminder of Timony’s prescience at the turn of the century as she sought out new ways to render both music   life meaningful again. When it was first released in 2000,   was either largely overlooked or actively derided by critics. Now, 20 years later, its influence can be traced in the many albums that followed (Sleater-Kinney’s psych-prog excursion   feels like it was directly inspired by Timony’s aesthetic sensibilities.) The album remains incredible and timeless: a place we can always return to that shows us how to survive the darkness, riding glimmers of light into the creation of new realities.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Four Tet took the material and sketched   as a culmination of Madlib’s work to this point, keeping some of the disorder that’s come to typify his instrumentals, but with a bit more refinement for newer listeners. With its stampeding percussion and looping bass, “The Call” embodies the grungy essence of Madlib’s   series. “Hang Out (Phone Off)” reminds me of a   track, its loud electro-funk bounce warrants a verse about Black empowerment or  . On the album’s back half—one “Latin Negro” and “Duumbiyay,” in particular—Four Tet brings out Madlib’s international side; the tracks resemble something heard on the second and third installments of his famed  . The result is a vast 41-minute set that floats by in a haze of repurposed psych-rock, obscure soul, and drum-heavy breakbeats. In its totality, it presents the many sides of Madlib: the crate-digging jazz head, and the zealous yeoman with a love for Brazilian and African sounds. With the help of Four Tet, the record maintains the looseness of Madlib’s previous work, but it plays like a sleek and cohesive statement. As with any Madlib album, it’s easy to wonder how much more of   is in the vault—though if history repeats,   is just the latest step toward a broader vision.

In 2021, being out and proud might seem like old hat, but many people in the queer community are still met with pushback—or worse—from the church, the government, or arbiters of social mores. Hekt, one-third of the dynamic pop-punk band  , explores those struggles, and more, on her debut solo album. Hekt’s punk roots are evident on  , but in a more subdued way. The music is spare and straightforward, the vocals lay high in the mix—it’s as though Hekt wants to be sure the listener doesn’t miss a word. Musically, the album mostly trades in folky punk, as heard on “In the Darkness,” a paean to democracy that would sound at home on a   album, or on the poppier “Stranded in Berlin,” which recalls  -era  . Like Bragg, Hekt tackles intimacy and romance (on “December” she’s terrified of unfamiliar feelings), as well as politics—the hooky “80 Days of Rain” details the effects climate change on wildlife.

Two weeks after its release, the UK went into lockdown, their album tour was cancelled, and life as we know it changed forever. “One is forced to suspect that   has been altogether too successful in its prophecy of doom,”   the London band in an interview back in April. “But perhaps shall it be said that our eve was in truth our dawn?” Their tongues were firmly in cheek, of course, but the fire-and-brimstone language does offer a clue to the genesis of the album, born in the drafty side-rooms of a small church in East London. Presumably with little more than psalm books for soundproofing, those rehearsal sessions drove Lunch Money Life towards a sound that teeters on the apocalyptic, a whirlwind of industrial riffage (“Truth Serum”), loose-hipped funk (“Superego”), and paranoid twitching (“Living3000”). Spencer Martin and his brother Jack Martin blend brass and electronics into a plunderphonic patchwork, augmented by white-hot jolts of noise from guitarist Sean Keating and a heavyweight rhythm section combining death-jazz low-end from Luke Mills-Pettigrew with Stewart Hughes’s ever-shifting mosaic of rhythms. While older influences are present (from Radiohead in their   groove to crossover outfits like   and  ) the band’s true musical allies belong to the mycelial network of jazz outfits across London, including Mercury Prize-nominated fusionists  , whose producer   had a hand in the album’s recording.

While the soundtrack never lets you forget that it’s there to do a cinematic job—out of context, the mischievous sounds of “Le Sedie Elettriche,” for example, are almost unbearably cutesy—there are still moments of extreme standalone coolness. Take the cocktail lounge jazz of “Il Boss E Le Pupe” and “Incontro Dei Boss,” featuring the smooth sounds of brass instruments, jazz drumming, and what appears to be a vibraphone.

One musician who took this initiative was vibraphonist Lon Moshe. Moshe & The Southern Freedom Arkestra’s album   is a gem of a recording from a time in which so many jazz greats were using the music to call on the power of a higher force. The album opens with “Prayer for Saude,” a heavy and somber spoken-word piece that calls for Black self-actualization through a revived connection to our ancestral ways. Urged on by the band’s free yet measured playing, poet Ngoma Ya Uhuru says, “We face East to the creator, our old-time religions lost in centuries past.” Whether it’s the driving post-bop abstraction of “Low Ghost” or the dreamy standout “Ballad For Bobby Hutcherson,”   is equally powerful when considered as a challenging collection of music and a reverent offering of spirit.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

{"album": "Boafo Ne Nyame", "artist": "Star Lovers", "description": "In 1987, singer K. Adusei, and a soon-to-be household name record producer, Frimpong Manso, met in an Accra music studio where some of the greatest Highlife musicians rose to stardom. Together, they created one of Ghana’s most versatile Highlife albums:  , a nostalgic record merging the sounds of the traditional pre-colonial musical style with the new swing of funk, pop, reggae, and synth influences sweeping the African continent. Highlife was so-named because it was   during colonial times, with guests at exclusive jazz clubs expected to wear formal dress to enjoy the Afro-Western tunes. It was reclaimed by the masses after Ghana’s 1957 independence from colonial rule in the “guitar band style,” where traditional string instruments like   were substituted with guitar to create unique Ghanaian sounds. On  , K. Adusei embodies that sound with a witty and melancholic ode to three of Highlife listeners’s favorite topics: faith, family, and money. The title track “Boafo ne Nyame,” meaning “God is a Helper,” is a slow reggae-funk-gospel ballad asking God to intervene in destructive human behaviors. In his conversational singing style, Adusei cries “As quickly as money falls into my hands, it burns away, so I’m begging God to extinguish this fire that follows me.” The cheerful beat of the drums, synthesizers, and guitar strings are a humorous parallel to the desperation of his lyrics. “Asem Da Ye So” (“Our Problems Are On Us”) is a fast-paced dance jam with deep funk and soul roots—heard in the guitar riffs—intermixed with disco themes and high-toned melodic backing vocals. The opening two-toned dum-dum of the drum followed by the melodic two-finger picking of the electric guitar is guaranteed to have filled many an Afro-and-bell-bottomed dance floor in its day. At eight minutes, it is the longest and most upbeat track on the album. In one of the bonus tracks “Abusua” (“Family”), Adusei brings back the funk and soul with a dash of pop. Asiedu sings, “The more money you have, the more family seems to come out of the woodwork.” That is the beauty of Highlife: funky rhythms and comedic lyrics hold a mirror up to society to reflect and do better.", "genre": ["World"]}

On their joyful, audacious, and constantly shapeshifting debut  , the pair deliver a document of salsa hybridity, honoring centuries of migration and cultural dialogues while embracing modern techniques that inform their musical DNA. Textured album opener “Dale Melón” sets a jubilant tone with congas and güiro that steadily grow into a tropical orchestra incorporating bass, piano, alto sax, and jangling Chajcha percussion. But the song’s casually lo-fi vocals also hint at a record seeking the euphoria of a Medellín block party while unafraid of cheeky experimentation. “Pelo Negro,” a cumbia-fied spin on Led Zeppelin’s “Black Dog” aims to pull the rug from under the listener, while on “Loco Por Tu Amor,” Contento double down on the imported flourishes with dark synths, a saturated bass line and jagged drum pads that flirt with electroclash.

Contento embrace salsa’s tangled and worldly history by paying tribute to New York boogaloo on “Las Gotas” and echoing the psychedelic organ melody of Santana’s “Oye Como Va” (itself a bold reimagining of Tito Puente’s classic) on “De Todas Maneras.” Their nod to African masters like   and   on the triumphant “Paso Palante,” perfectly captures the duo’s musical voraciousness, as well as their understanding that home is a transient and evolving idea.", "genre": ["World"]}

Where  was a tale of resistance, SAULT’s latest release  is a cautious celebration, an album that works overtime to heal wounds and lift up Black lives and Black culture. The spirit of the entire record is summarized in the final lyrics of the funk and Brazilian batucada song “The Beginning & The End”: “We shall reclaim our joy/ We shall remuster our strength/ Through millennia bathed in the tears of a thousand ancestors/ We shall rise/ As it was in the beginning, so too it shall be in the end.” That this joy and resilience is claimed through a decidedly dancefloor-oriented record is deliberate; music and dance have been an act of defiance and resistance throughout the Black diaspora. Songs like the disco and ‘70s funk banger, “Fearless;” the standout dub, funk, and synth track “I Just Want to Dance;” and the Motown-ish “Street Fighter” are calls to action disguised as party jams, inspiring fearlessness in spite of systemic oppression. The album is masterclass in how to fuse the spoken word and musical traditions of Black communities around the globe into a single potent narrative. More importantly, it’s an album full of compelling tales of resistance passed down, with love and urgency, to fuel the fight for Black lives.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}
{"album": "No era sólida", "artist": "Lucrecia Dalt", "description": "Colombia-born, Berlin-based musician and sound artist  s second album for the Brooklyn label  . is a record of unraveling and reformation. To create these 10 songs, Dalt summoned an alter-ego of sorts called Lia, whose creative practice is to reflect Dalt’s artistic POV back to her. The album’s title translates to mean, “it was not solid,” a nod to the fluid ideas about creation and interpretation that inform the project. It’s also a twist on Dalt’s background as a geotechnical engineer. While the compression of tectonic plates, or extreme stress on a rock mass, was the theoretical inspiration for her last album, 2018’s  , this time around, the pressure manifests in ghostlier tones. In the 1700’s, the word “sublime” was   as, “operating in a manner analogous to terror,” and it’s that nebulous emotional terrain Dalt is exploring on   Its songs are intellectual and visceral at the same time. Album opener “Disuelta” feels like hallucinatory trap; piercing, methodical synths make way for Lia’s woozy, spectral singing that is more shadow than sound. It is the perfect preamble for what’s to come, an album that essentially sounds like it’s been turned inside-out. Tracks like “Espera” and “Endiendo” feel rickety, evoking the anxiety of being stuck on some unstable platform. But each sound is patterned with such precision that in Dalt’s hands, there’s only pleasure in the fall.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

The group’s sound is significantly darker and more brooding than most “spiritual jazz.” Their version of “Motherless Child,” made famous by folk singer Richie Havens, is a wail of anguish. Trible’s not always even singing lyrics; on the opening “Nature’s Vision” and especially “OLBAP,” he’s spitting out streams of wordless syllables, shadowed by overdubbed voices, as percussion and kalimba rumble and rattle all around him and the saxophone cries out from the darkness.

{"album": "Hype Nostalgia", "artist": "Rituals of Mine", "description": "Since 2015, Terra Lopez has been on an emotional rollercoaster. The San Diego-born musician lost both her father and her best friend in the span of six months, and later weathered the loss of her voice and the dissolution of her band, Sister Crayon. Now a solo artist under the name Rituals of Mine, Lopez uses futuristic R&B and bass-heavy electronic music to create a soundtrack to moments where self confidence, exhilaration, disappointment, rage, and love are given voice through beautifully crafted melodies, all of them striving to reach the light rather than sinking into the darkness below. Throughout  Lopez’s soft, sweet voice is underscored by rippling, piano-driven melodies, broken beats, and sparse synths; but her lyrics always cut deep. R&B ballad “Come Around Me” details the travails of queer women of color in the music industry; “Heights” captures the moment when bottled-up emotions bubble to the surface. ”Trauma,” “Post Trauma,” and “Free Throw” veer from the album’s slow-burn approach, introducing darker elements into the mix. Sludgy synths, hard trap beats, and chopped-and-screwed samples provide a canvas against which Lopez explores inherited trauma. The album closes with the bare piano ballad “The Last Wave,” a touching tribute to her father that also serves as an act of recognition—coming face to face with grief, and accepting a new reality. If   is a rollercoaster, “The Last Wave” is the sound of Lopez stepping off and bravely facing her changed world.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}
{"album": "Renegade Breakdown", "artist": "Marie Davidson & L’Œil Nu", "description": "At the beginning of “Renegade Breakdown,” the title track from  ’s follow-up to her critically-fêted 2018 album  , the singer offers a disclaimer: “By the way, there are no money makers on this record,” she deadpans over searing guitar riffs and layered synths. “This time, I’m exploring the loser’s point of view.” From her solo releases to her work with her husband Pierre Guerineau in Montreal electronic duo  , fans have come to expect these self-effacing   from Davidson. This time out, though, her statement is a bit of a misdirect:   contains some of Davidson’s warmest and most accessible material to date. Conceived as a response to the physical and mental burnout she experienced as a result of constant touring, Davidson formed a trio, L’Œil Nu, with long-time collaborators Guerineau and multi-instrumentalist Asaël R. Robitaille. Their chemistry is evident across the album’s ten tracks, which makes stops into   robot rock, 80s synth-pop, and after hours lounge jazz. Guided by the Holy Trinity of Billie Holiday, Stevie Nicks, and French pop star Mylène Farmer—to name just a few of their shared influences—the group effortlessly moves between eras and styles, Davidson delivering introspective tales that spare no emotional punches. On the unhurried “Just In My Head,” she reflects on the loneliness and weariness of being a solo traveling artist, singing, “I’ve been to many places, it just made me miss you even more” in a hushed voice. “Lead Sister” is the album’s most outré offering, with its MIDI interpolation of a piece by Italian baroque composer Alessandro Marcello; its lyrics are based on the tragic tale of Karen Carpenter. Songs like “C’est parce que j’m’en fous” and “Worst Comes To Worst” suggest that reports of Davidson’s retirement from the dancefloor have been greatly exaggerated; the latter’s nu-disco stomp picks up where  ’s world-beating, Grammy-nominated   left off. On the opposite end of the spectrum, “My Love” and “Sentiment” feel like nostalgic jukebox selections cued up for last call singalongs as the house lights are coming on. Instead of this genre-leapfrogging causing whiplash,  succeeds by building on Davidson’s pop songwriting instincts, while reveling in the simple joys of creating music with close friends.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "Help", "artist": "Duval Timothy", "description": "The latest album from London-born pianist and multidisciplinary artist Duval Timothy,   combines Jazz with contemporary electronica in songs that explore everything from the transatlantic slave trade to the trials of mental health. The songs beautifully blend programmed beats with organic instrumentation; album-opener “Next Tomorrow” is a gorgeous Drum & Bass tune with undertones of wistful Jazz that recalls Lunatic Harness-era U-ziq. Tracks like the warped and atmospheric “Alone” and the dark and dreamy “Morning” showcase Timothy’s range. The former, with its pitch-bent sax lines and chattering vocal samples, feels woozy and surreal; the latter, with cottony synths wrapped in loose, silvery jazz guitar, is quietly beatific. And then there’s “Slave,” which features Twin Shadow, and serves as a harrowing meditation on both the history of the slave trade as well as its contemporary implications. Over a heartbreaking piano melody, a series of voices repeat the word “Slave” over and over, piling on top of one another to the point of disorientation. The entire song feels weary—the sound of a world dragged down by the weight of history. Help is packed with daring and beautifully performed compositions like this; its every note heralds the arrival of a fertile and formidable musical mind.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

Before long, he was remixing  , but for a moment, we saw a glimpse of an unfamiliar A. G. Cook.

Each track on   for example, sports a percussion-heavy front end with a blissed out ending. It’s a series of rollercoaster genre experiments, a shock of ice water for those who might be mostly familiar with Cook’s more accessible work. The gentleness present in much of Cook’s best work is more present on the next disc,  , on which he revisits the songs from his Secret Sky set (the Owen-esque “Being Harsh,” and an acoustic version of his 2016 single “Superstar”). In the first of the many covers on the set, Cook transforms Blur’s “Beetlebum” into a Nirvana b-side, complete with Cobain vocal affectations. The love for early ‘00s pop that permeates much of Cook’s work made his fondness for music with an uncool amount of intensity clear, so it’s not entirely surprising that he’s started to add emo, brit-pop, and grunge to his ever expanding palette. Cook is at his most ominous on  , using the waveform for a variety of sinister carnival sounds, all draped in fuzz, while   finds Cook doing his best Nobuo Uematsu.   is maybe the most diverse of all the discs, with Cook’s hymnal take on Taylor Swift’s “The Best Day” butting up next to the digital dissonance of “Triptych Demon.” The last two discs,  and   offer some of the most intense moments of the whole set, between the unsettling urgent whispering of “No Yeah,” the demonic howls of “Hold On,” and the absolutely belted out private-room-karaoke-take on Sia’s “Chandelier.”  is a sprawling achievement, that serves as both as an encapsulation of Cook’s work to date, and where he might be going in the future. It’s a testament to Cook’s skill that none of the 49 tracks feel like filler, but instead offer discrete visions into what pop music can and could be.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Collectively, they offer both glimpses into Cathcart’s loveworn heart as well as remarkably poignant scenes of a city that, in his eye, oscillates between a wonderland and a wasteland. As The Cradle, Cathcart has long favored brief songs that lean on his fragile voice and hypnotic acoustic guitar figures, but veer, without warning, towards rushes of brittle sound, sweet harmonies, and warbling horns.   utilizes a similar palette, and the recordings are still raw—some were put down on a four-track, others are interspersed with Voice Memos and abutted with chaotic noise—but the record nonetheless presents some of his strongest and most direct songwriting to date.

{"album": "Total Freedom", "artist": "Kathleen Edwards", "description": "Longtime fans of Kathleen Edwards can appreciate the dark humor in the fact that the Canadian country songwriter decided to stage a comeback the same year the whole world shut down indefinitely. Her entire career—to say nothing of the characters in her songs—has been characterized by this kind of bum luck. The one-two punch of her stunning 2002 debut   and its 2004 follow-up   announced Edwards as someone who could write about people shoved to society’s margins with both compassion and precision. “Six O’Clock News,”  s opening track, told the story of a standoff between the police and a man holed up with a gun in a second story apartment with such detail you could practically smell the sweat and gunpowder. When she wrote about herself, that fatalism took on a wry, self-effacing edge; “Write a hit so I can talk you up,” she once sang to a mythical rock star boyfriend, “No one likes a girl who won’t sober up.” The knowing title of that track is Edwards’ career in a nutshell: “One More Song the Radio Won’t Like.” She kept that combination of caustic wit, narrative acuity, and scalding gallows humor going through three records, each as strong as the last, each ultimately just clearing the brush for similarly minded artists like Miranda Lambert and Ashley Monroe to storm through. Each new Edwards LP met with the same commercial indifference. So, like any sensible artist, she changed tactics: In 2011 she released  , which was produced by then-boyfriend Justin Vernon and which traded barbed humor and cutting country riffs for soft-focus pop songs that focused more explicitly on matters of the heart. The public shrugged, and the album came and went; seven years later, another country songwriter pulled the exact same maneuver, except this time the album was called   and it ended up in the upper regions of most of the year’s Top 10 Lists and scored an Album of the Year Grammy. For die-hard Edwards fans, it was hard  to feel like there was some kind of perverse cosmic conspiracy keeping one of the world’s greatest songwriters sidelined. And so when she finally ditched the whole bag in 2014 to open a coffee shop in her hometown of Ottawa—hilariously named “Quitters”—who could blame her? In an  , she said she couldn’t imagine returning to music. Now, five years after that interview, she has, and her comeback album   contains some of her most inward-looking work to date; its muted, watercolor pop sound feels perfectly designed for long days spent indoors. On  , Edwards takes stock of her life, presenting her findings with sensitivity and, occasionally, self-deprecation. The tone is set from the get-go with “Glenfern,” a genuinely sweet thank-you note from Edwards to her ex-husband and former bandmate Colin Cripps that expresses gratitude for the years they spent together while also getting in a few jabs at the music industry: “Now when I find myself looking back, I think of all the cool shit that happened,” Edwards sings, “Like, we had a tour bus with a bed in the back/ We bought a rock and roll dream—and it was total crap.” On “Simple Math,” a tender ode to lifelong friendship, she marks the passage of time in generations: “Building forts in cedar trees/ Ice cream, banana seats/ Everything and nothing changes/ And now we are our mothers’ age.” “Who Rescued Who” is a big-hearted love song to Edwards’ rescue dog, and on “Options Open,” over a gleaming slide-guitar hook, Edwards smirks at her own persistent singlehood (“For 39 years, I’ve been keeping my options open”). Flashes of the old Edwards cutting wit turn up—particularly on “Fool’s Ride,” where she thoroughly dismantles a terrible ex-boyfriend (the umpteenth warning sign becomes, “A red flag flying in a shit parade”). But overall, the Edwards on   is more reflective; the instruments are treated so that they become bands of sound that stretch softly across the backdrop of the songs, making for music that is more textural than the gravel-road Americana of her early work. The quietly crushing “Ashes to Ashes” is just a few whispers of acoustic guitar and cottony atmospherics; “Hard on Everyone” adopts a War on Drugs-y chug, the guitars as liquid and shapeless as rain on a windowpane. What comes through more than anything on   is the sound of contentment. There was a kind of urgency to Edwards’ early work that’s common to an artist who’s trying to claw their way into view. On  , defeat and bitterness has given way to wonder and wisdom. It is a record made to be attentively played, thoughtfully absorbed, and quietly considered.

Like her contemporaries Arca, FKA twigs, and Aisha Devi—as well as aesthetic ancestors like Genesis P-Orridge—Abyss X is fascinated by the many different ways a voice can break.

{"album": "UNTITLED (Black Is)", "artist": "SAULT", "description": "In 1965, in response to the assasination of Malcolm X, poet, organizer and cultural critic, Amiri Baraka crystalized Black America’s righteous anger and fury into a poem entitled “Black Art.” In this foundational work, Baraka argued for a revolutionary Black aesthetic that would be used primarily in service of Black liberation. In the most famous section of the poem, Baraka rejects the European conception of “art for art’s sake,” instead calling for poems that waged war on white supremacy and capitalism as well as their ancillaries, the police. “We want poems that kill, he wrote, “Assassin poems, Poems that shoot guns. Poems that wrestle cops into alleys and take their weapons leaving them dead” From its opening moments, it’s clear that  ’s latest release,  is a work of Black art that is made for the struggle. In a nod to the Black Power era and the radical energy that ignited it,   opens with the track “Out The Lies.” After booming chants of “Revolution has come! Still won’t put down the gun! (a refrain that the Black Panther Party would employ at actions back in the day), the song gives way to somber piano and a spoken word section that details the beauty, joy, and resistance inherent in being Black in a world inundated with anti-blackness: “Black is safety, Black is benevolence, Black is a lifeboat after an SOS…and when everything else fails, Black endures” The album kicks into full gear with “Stop Dem,” a midtempo head-nodder with thick, slapping drums and a heavy bassline. The track’s layered gang vocals also take on the form of a chant, full of fire and indignation: “Even though we know that you fear us, that ain’t no reason to kill us.” “Wildfires” uses a dreamy, echoing groove as the backdrop for a searing indictment of the police’s long campaign of terror against the Black community. “You should be ashamed/ the bloodshed on your hands,” a vocalist sings, “Take off your badge/ We all know it was murder/ Murder, murder/ Murder.” On “Bow,” which features a guest appearance by Michael Kiwanuka, SAULT’s mission to protect and affirm Black life is taken to its most logical, pan-diasporic conclusion. Over a bubbling, Afro-Beat groove, Kiwanuka delivers an anthem celebrating the kinship and solidarity of Black people everywhere: “Answer to Kenya/ Check in with Uganda/ Remember Rwanda/ I see Tanzania/ From Verde to Ghana/ Take care of Somalia/ Free Sudan/ Blood thicker than water.” It goes without saying that the album’s themes are timely; but another aspect of its power is the way   feels connected to the centuries of Black art that came before it. As Baraka reminded us back in ‘65, Black art and creativity must be used as a weapon of resistance. The songs on   sometimes serve as affirmations, asserting our own inalienable beauty and power; other times they appear in the form of protest, giving voice to our outrage and pain while serving as a vehicle for us to envision a new and better world.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

{"album": "To Know Without Knowing", "artist": "Mulatu Astatke & Black Jesus Experience", "description": "The pentatonic kignit modes that make up most Ethiopian music are sonically unique to that country, but thanks to Mulatu Astatke, the father of the genre, Ethio-jazz was a hybrid from the jump. Studying at Berklee College of Music in the 1960’s, Astatke was drawn to the shimmering tones of the vibraphone from modern jazz and the kinetic conga drums of Latin music. So when he recorded his groundbreaking 1966 debut,  , Astatke drew on these sounds and fused them with his own musical heritage to create something wholly unique. Ethio-jazz has remained flexible and open-ended ever since. So it makes sense that Astatke collaborates so well with others—like when he teamed up with UK jazz-funk ensemble Heliocentrics back in 2009 for the instant classic   (featuring a young  ) and when he worked with Australian octet Black Jesus Experience in 2016 on  . On  , Astatke and that Australian ensemble are together again, instantly rekindling the fire of their first collaboration. “Mulatu” opens with a languid funk foundation, perfect for Astatke’s contemplative vibraphone work (and on-mic humming). But as the piece unfurls, it flips to doubletime, and soon we’re in a percolating groove perfect for Zimbabwean/Australian MC, Mr. Monk, who pays respect to the “survivors of genocide and displacement in this modern day playpen.” That pattern repeats throughout. Astatke and band build up a mesmerizing Ethio-jazz rhythmic bed that moves the body while Monk and stunning BJE vocalist Enushu Taye address the heart and mind. She’s lithe and weightless on the nimble “Lijay” and stirring on the title track. But the centerpiece “Living on Stolen Land” is clearly her standout performance. “I got away with that bloody murder,” she sings again and again, detached at first but revealing new worry and pain with each repetition, finally getting to the brutal chorus of “Ain’t it grand?/ Living on stolen land?” The 10-minute piece ranges from brooding and fiery to calm, showing how Astatke and BJE follow one another almost telepathically. Lyrically inspired and musically assured,  , continues to expand the parameters of what Ethio-jazz can be in the 21st century, proving—as Monk puts it at one point—“Music a levitating force, of course.”", "genre": ["Jazz"]}
{"album": "weight of the world", "artist": "MIKE", "description": "In a way, it’s surprising that it’s taken the New York rapper MIKE this long to name an album  . Ever since his 2017 breakthrough   the chief trait that has come to define his music is his willingness to keep his emotions close to the surface. 2019’s career-best   was a raw and moving rumination on the death of his mother, and albums like 2018’s   were unsparing catalogs of insecurity and self doubt. But on  , his struggles are external: “I was hurtin’, savin’ n—s who wouldn’t do the same,” he raps on “No No” over a bleary soul loop, “I gave my purpose out to n—s who was choosin’ fame.” Betrayal is the running theme on   its songs are dotted with references to double-crossers and manipulative friends, “serpents,” and “leeches in your circle.” The tone isn’t accusatory, it’s wounded; on “Coat of Many Colors”—the title of which is a reference the Biblical story in which Joseph is betrayed by his brothers—MIKE raps, “I offer n—s my advice, and they just see a fortune/ Try to lean me for it, these n—s be informants” while a sanded-down, smoked-up lounge loop spins lazily in the background, like a tonearm stuck in a locked groove. “Where was you when I sat in the rain?” he asks late in the album, “Is you stupid, or lacking a brain?” The imagery feels deliberate—he may lash out in the back half of the verse, but the first half is a heartbreaking depiction of abandonment. MIKE has always favored production that was woozy and blown out, but on  , it’s even more diffuse than usual, at times approaching the slowed-down hypnagogia of vaporwave. The backdrop to “More Gifts” consists of little more than a soul song snipped short and set to half speed, and “Plans” is all treble-heavy, empty-mall expansiveness. It’s not lazy, just efficient; the heavily saturated sounds suit the album’s somber subject matter, and the producers—primarily dj blackpower and keiyaa—save the pyrotechnics for specific, calculated moments. On the title track, the beat shapeshifts three times in conjunction with the narrative: first it’s chipmunk soul; then, 90 seconds in, it abruptly shifts to call center hold music; then it shifts a third time into a rubbery, re-worked Latin soft pop ballad. Keiyaa turns “222” into a production showcase, giddily skipping keys and bass across a rippling ocean of synths. And on the album-closing “Allstar,” which features an appearance by Earl Sweatshirt, dj blackpower pushes the beat deep into the background to forefront the MCs. The song doesn’t offer any closure on the album’s dominant theme; MIKE is too honest for that kind of moralizing, and also that’s not really the point. The point is instead summarized in MIKE’s final verse: “Poke a hole into my chest, watch it bleed violet.”   isn’t about healing, it’s about bloodletting. These 16 songs are the sound of grief in progress.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}

It’s only fitting that the sessions went down at L.A.’s storied EastWest Studios, where both Nicks and Petty had history.

The crunching, bluesy riffs of the perils-of-stardom plaint “Twinkle Twinkle” and the airy Laurel Canyon twang of “Letting Me Down” are two high points, showcasing Price’s been-around-the-block vocals and her attraction to moody melodies. Produced by alt-Americana cohort Sturgill Simpson, it breathes in a way that lets you hear the air in the room, as plangent piano licks, sweetly surging organ, and a warm, comfy bed of acoustic/electric strumming set the tone for roots-rocking tales of betrayal, toxic relationships, and lessons learned from huge mistakes.

Yet save for a couple   and the Instagram stories of a few dedicated locals, there’s almost no documentation of their rampage. If you couldn’t see them live yourself, they were practically a myth, a band you just had to take a local’s blood oath about. Now, Skeleton’s   puts on record the force of what Austin metalpunks have known for the past couple years.

The opening track is a grand entrance, worthy of joining the lineage of iconic thrash bands who reference    . On “Mark of Death,” Skeleton channel Motörhead’s “Overkill,” with Victor summoning that classic’s iconic double-bass intro. While never short on ambition, Skeleton’s punk background means they don’t mince words or riffs, and David in particular is gifted at conveying concrete emotions through his guitar. His riffs communicate triumph as convincingly as they do weariness, as evident in “Ring of Fire,” where he gives Celtic Frost’s signature mid-paced stomp a saddened doom sheen. In “The Sword,” David’s dimly-lit intro speaks to trepidation, before moving on to a jaunty verse and a fearless jump into the unknown in pursuit of victory.

Perhaps you’ll notice the way O’Neil’s fluorescent guitar mimics the earworm bassline of Siouxsie and the Banshees’ “Happy House” long before she begins to slink through the lyrics, her downcast tone reaffirming the original’s domestic sarcasm. Or maybe you’ll spot the hypnotic sway of Boy George’s “Crying Game” in her warped Spaghetti Western six-string tone, again before she sighs its devastating first verse.  is O’Neil’s sad-eyed covers collection that doubles as an affectionate mixtape for her late brother, Brian, who died last year. Using a drum machine, simple electronics, and melancholic guitar, O’Neil revisits the songs of their shared adolescence from memory, rendering an emotionally complex portrait of the ways we carry songs with us as we age. O’Neil is not interested in faithful takes on the likes of Bananarama’s “Cruel Summer” or INXS’ “Don’t Change”—they are mere fodder for reflection, arrows between the innocence of youth and the experience of adulthood. She rearranges the former with the surreal delirium of a house of mirrors, doubling and tripling her voice beneath a rhythm section that suggests a gamelan band playing a few miles away. And she slow-walks the latter, bending those original four minutes of triumphant belief into a tragic seven-minute meditation on the frailties that make us mortal. Her 37-second melodica summary of Depeche Mode’s “Everything Counts” suggests the way she might idly hum it to herself. She adds a serrated solo to a 90-second snippet of Aztec Camera’s “Oblivious,” like a prospective teenage guitar hero fantasizing about standing beneath the bright lights of the stage someday. Released when O’Neil was already half a decade into her indie rock career, Cher’s “Believe” is an anachronism for this ’80s-anchored set. But O’Neil’s plaintive organ rendition epitomizes the premise of  : How we hear, internalize, and remember a song can be as important as how it actually sounds.

With its rolling, reggae-rooted drum and bass groove anchoring McFarlane’s vocals, the song is a beautifully crafted exploration of the metaphysical.

It’s mostly meant to stay out of the way—maybe you’ll let it simmer around the house in the background. But the songs Smith creates are so alluring, you can’t help but be drawn to them. They’re the sound of a weary soul finally reaching nirvana. Smith’s new album,  , celebrates electricity—not just the currents running through walls and wires, but also the kind that pass through Smith’s body, to her modular synthesizers, and then out into the air once the songs have been created. As she was working on  , Smith taught herself a type of physical movement that allowed her to see frequencies. “The inspiration came to me in a sudden bubble of joy,” she says in the album notes. “It was accompanied by a multitude of shapes that were moving seamlessly from one into the other.”   feels the same way: a cavalcade of sounds where each one slowly morphs into the next. The opening track, “Unbraiding Boundless Energy Within Boundaries,” is a prime example: sonic bubbles and darting synths summon images of bodies floating in water. “Remembering,” with its blend of classical strings and wind instruments, functions as a soothing instrumental until the 3:30 mark when Smith’s vocals come in, her dulcet soprano hovering within the rhythm. She doesn’t sing words; instead, she just hums gently, using her hushed tone to convey a sense of calm.  works best on noise-cancelling headphones, played front-to-back. But while it’s meant for continuous listening—look away and you’re on track five before you know it—the record’s full of standalone cuts that beg deeper dissection. “Carrying Gravity,” an orchestral composition near the middle of the album, seems to signal a human awakening, a rising from slumber to a new level of consciousness. “The Spine Is Quiet In The Center” finds Smith in the middle of said awakening—the strings, synths and backing vocals tuned just a bit brighter to signal a new dawn. That leads to “Expanding Electricity,” the album’s sprawling 10-minute centerpiece; Smith throws everything into the track, crafting one long piece designed to resemble the human body in its complete form. It’s not only the album’s best song, it’s where Smith’s premise congeals: The culmination of all that electricity, uniting to make magical art.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

{"album": "A Heart So White", "artist": "Jonny Nash & Suzanne Kraft", "description": "The serene ambient music of Jonny Nash & Suzanne Kraft (a moniker of producer Diego Herrera) sounds like it’s been whittled down until little remains. Nash has explored this gentle minimalism in the quiet, sparse and immensely beautiful LPs he’s released via his Amsterdam label   Herrera, who previously played keyboards in the kinetic L.A. electronic band  , reserves his most pastoral work for Nash’s label. Their first collaborative album, 2017’s airy  , was made entirely with computer software, but retained a remarkable sense of atmosphere with every gentle thrum. Even at its most processed, the music they make together conveys a remarkable sense of chemistry and communication. Though Nash and Herrera have released many recordings since  , including a   of solo works featuring atmospheric jazz legend Gigi Masin, their second proper album together,  , marks an unexpected and rewarding turning point in their brilliant collaboration. The pair shifts to an entirely acoustic set up, built around a wheezing mechanical organ and delicate Steinway piano. But the space and serenity remains blissfully undisturbed. Silence is as essential as sound here; clusters of silvery piano notes often appear and decay entirely, creating enormous space for the next note to float forward. For a project defined by a sense of space, the organ breathing throughout   becomes vital. Constant hums and pulses of air run through tracks like opener “The Pearl” and “Guilt Or Fear,” where the typically towering instrument creates a warm, intimate foundation to wandering guitar notes. Each quiet moment builds in absorbing power until the penultimate “Knife,” which arrives as a soft peak. Punctuated by a rhythmically repeating note—its subtle staccato pulse the closest thing to a sharp sound on the album—the piece gradually folds in piano, guitar, and the touch tones of a phone over nine luxurious minutes. It can be easy to see minimalist electronic music as “ambient,” while misjudging similar acoustically-derived music as “academic,” but  feels borderless and unconstrained. Its vast tapestry of sound makes room for classical, jazz, and ambient while stretching out like a horizon.", "genre": ["Ambient"]}

With its roots in Haitian Voodoo, Chouk Bwa’s music is built on the sound of traditional hand and stick drums, which pound out hypnotic, cyclical rhythms. From the triumphant opening rhythm—which pulses through a layer of misty synth like a beating heart beneath the skin—the album conducts experiments with texture and pacing, resulting in a series of tracks that as enthralling as they are invigorating. Throughout, the drum trio of Gomez “Djopipi” Henris, Sadrack “Mazaka Lakwa” Merzier, and Jean Rigaud Aimable layer complex patterns on top of one another, bringing each song to its energetic brink, then expertly reigning it back in again. Meanwhile, sandy-voiced singer Jean Claude “Sambaton” Dorvil and the chorus of Maloune Prévaly and Edèle “Sasufi” Joseph offer spiritual call-and-response melodies that stir the soul, regardless of whether or not you understand its lyrics about resilience and salvation. Nicolas Esterle and Frédéric Alstadt—The Ångströmers—add rumbling, humming bass synths that rise and fall with the energy of the drums. Attentive sound design—like the deep, hollow drum warbles that are drawn out and oscillated on instrumental track “Kay Marasa Dub,” or the carefully placed, amplified cricket sounds and electronic twinkles on semi-acapella track “Peleren”—create moments of intimacy and tactility.  is a joyous blend of ancient and contemporary sounds, an example of the innovation that can happen when artists build bridges across different musical eras and genres.", "genre": ["World", "electro"]}

Witch Prophet sings in Amharic, English, and Tigrinya, and the songs—each named for a member of Witch Prophet’s family—is both strikingly modern and clearly influenced by traditional East African melodies. On   past and present are simultaneous. “TESFAY” combines a tight, bubbling bassline with crisp, Tony Allen-style drumming as Witch Prophet sings about showing off and shining, while Karen Ng’s deft saxophone lines twist alongside her. Album standout “DARSHAN” is a sweet, jazzy lullaby, with Witch Prophet singing of the deep, transformative love she has for her son: “Never felt a love like this before/ You chose me and changed me/ I am so grateful/ What a gift, what a joy, my baby boy.” The rhythm on “ROMAN” goes from loose and bouncing to lockstep boom-bap, held together by a repeated piano loop. And on “MAKDA” Witch Prophet assumes the persona of the biblical Ethiopian Queen Makeda, celebrating her own black excellence in tandem with her family history and cultural lineage.

These pensive neo-classical pieces boast textures similar to downcast ambient luminaries   and  , yet Alexander’s compositions softly evaporate rather than disintegrate. Opener “Palliative” features a repeating musical motif that slowly wanes throughout its 11 minutes until the second half is subsumed in effects. There are moments where Alexander’s sound sources become unrecognizable: the low-pitched drone that begins “Matter of Balance,” and the final 30 seconds of “Fortuité,” where he turns off his loops and simply plinks on the keys. “Aspect Withdrawn” provides the most vivid sketch of these various approaches.

{"album": "Less of Everything", "artist": "Es", "description": "“What have I acquired/ To be feeling so tired?,” Es’ Maria Cecilia Tedemalm asks on the opening track to the London synth-punks’ debut LP,   Tedemalm’s voice is sing-song, full of rueful attitude. She’s got just enough energy left to be furious at the state of things—information overload, the deeply stratified inequities that prop up late capitalism’s rotten structure, the constant churn of work. The balance between exhaustion and urgency is carried through by Es’ instrumental heft—Flora Watters’ buzzing analog synths, Tamsin Leach’s sharp and precise drumming, Katy Cotterell’s round, rubbery bass tone.  Like their obvious predecessors (Bjork’s anarcho-punk project, Kukl, and the great German trio,  , come to mind), one could describe Es’ sound as goth-adjacent, but there’s no sense of detachment here. Instead, all three are threaded with high-tension wire. Tedemaum’s lyrics are pointed and direct, whether she’s describing a frustrating personal relationship (“Mystery”) or the paranoiac surveillance state (“Off the Rails”). The rhythmic interplay between Cotterell and Leach is both simple and masterful (Cotterell also offers the bulk of Es’ melody), and Watters’ synths add acidic scribble at the most fraught moments, bedrock in the quieter ones. This is an economical group with no part out of place. It’s smart, lean music for difficult, chaotic times, pared back to muscle and bone, truth and instinct.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"]}

They don’t need much messing with.” That’s one reason why his being tapped to put together a volume for ! ‘s  series seemed almost counterintuitive. Manchester’s Mr. Scruff—a longtime   affiliate, cartoonist, and evangelist for properly brewed tea—likes playing long: his preferred set time is five hours, and he likes to play as wide a selection as possible. A great Mr. Scruff set is like a living, dancing history of black music from around the world, from jazz to techno and beyond, with any number of stops in between. The length—the immersion, the trust—is part of the satisfaction of a great Mr. Scruff set. Not so on   great Mr. Scruff set. Concentrating 31 tracks into 73 minutes, his   installation forgoes sonic stamina for condensed power. Many tracks were short to begin with—Rosa Maria’s three-minute froth bomb “Samba Maneiro” is just one delightful example—but the groove he builds has a coiled power that’s unusual for him. It can make you move a dozen different ways, but it feels aimed at the ear specifically. (The release’s timing is sadly appropriate on that front.) If anything, this is a left field showcase, right from the start—the mix’s opening roundelay is mostly newer tracks with a freewheeling sense of auditory trickery, from Iona Fortune’s springy ambient to Sudan Archives’ plucked-string meditation. Another highlight, Archie Pelago’s “Brown Oxford,” reconfigures a walking stand-up bass and smeared brass as the basis of a trick-heavy house track that disguises its deeply psychedelic properties with a straight face.

{"album": "Floppy Disk Overdrive", "artist": "Master Boot Record", "description": " the latest album from computer-obsessed, metal-chiptune composer  , feels like a soup-to-nuts reboot of the seven records that came before it. The game play is similar—a highly melodic head-on collision between heavy metal hooks and neoclassical nods—but the execution is on another level entirely. From the lock-step licks and go-for-broke opening gambit of “ANSI.SYS” to the multi-colored movements and spastic final stages of “HIMEM.SYS,” it’s like the difference between 8-bit pixels and an 8K Xbox. A lot of that has to do with the fact that MBR’s lone programmer isn’t an opportunistic hack leaning on a slick piece of generative software. He’s a proper musician who took piano lessons as a kid, and switched over to singing and guitar-slaying once he discovered the more extreme corners of metal’s underground scene. Decades of developing a distinct style alongside a deep, undying love of computers led to this: a blinding symphony of scorched earth songs that are as much Slayer as they are Stravinsky—in spirit, at least. Restless pieces like “EDIT.COM” and “RAMDRIVE.SYS” refuse to sit still, cramming an album’s worth of ideas into eight winding minutes. There’s no point in trying to keep track of all the time changes; like any game worth beating, it’s better to let   wash over you, with its allusions to everything from Sofia Coppola’s  soundtrack (probably the only place you’ll find piano-led opuses and string-laced concertos slotted alongside Squarepusher and Aphex Twin) to metallic speedrun music. Hell, the beginning of “DBLSPACE.EXE” even sounds a little like Danzig. At the end of  , only one question remains: Play again? Well, yeah.", "genre": ["Electronic", "video game music"]}

It’s forward-thinking jazz fusion   Jaco Pastorius fused with strains of P-Funk, R&B, L.A.-bred electronic music, and rock. He alternates between playing bass lines at seemingly impossible speeds and thumping, relaxed notes. Lyrically, the shifts are equally unpredictable. Whimsy and comedy are always tempered by sincerity and vulnerability. His fourth album,  , is looser than those that preceded it, favoring improvisation and raw emotion. These are diary entries and confessional texts delivered from a spacecraft speeding through the cosmos until it stalls, drifts, and starts again. The search for connection—platonic and romantic—is one of the dominant themes of Thundercat’s catalog, but it’s the central theme of  . After losing a dear friend—the late Mac Miller, whom he laments on “Fair Chance”—and weathering the tempests of a breakup, his search for intimacy makes sense. You can hear the different iterations of that quest, and the eccentric extremes of his music by examining “I Love Louis Cole” and lead single “Dragonball Durag.” The former is jazz-funk fusion played with the driving speed of anime intros, backed by percussion that verges on punk. It’s a paean to partying with Cole, an alcohol-fueled bromance set in a galaxy where Goku and Pikachu coexist. At the end, Thundercat blacks out, going full Super Saiyan on a blistering solo. “Dragonball Durag,” on the other hand, is funky and slow R&B. Part absurdist come-on and partly a plea for stylistic approbation and companionship, it’s funny and touching as only Thundercat can be.", "genre": ["Electronic", "R&B"]}

The album would be called   and its creation would be live-streamed. They invited a dozen guest emcees to join them in the studio—this was before strict “social distancing” measures had been imposed—conducted a marathon 11-hour recording session, spent the rest of the night mixing and mastering the record, and dropped the finished product the next day. Fittingly, the album’s cover depicts the elements that presumably were involved in its creation: a surgical mask, gloves, hand sanitizer, a pen, a rhyme book, a shot glass, and a dime bag. The album was recorded in Brooklyn, New York and most of the artists who make cameos are natives of the borough. The roster includes buzzing blue chips like  ,  , and Nems, alongside seasoned vets like   (Smif ’N Wessun), Lil Fame (M.O.P.), and  . The tone is set from the outset on “Pandemic,” where Term raps: “Living in scary times, prepare to die/ Mask on your face with your hands sanitized/ Silent cries from the rich, now they victimized/ Not a big surprise, hope you bitches fry/ Let’s not forget this whole nation was colonized/ Given diseases, rape, pillage, and skinned alive.” While not every song is that direct, references to the pandemic abound. On album standout cut “Relatable,” Pro Era co-founder CJ Fly flexes intricate wordplay in his topical verse: “This quarantine ain’t nothing new, I’m used to being the illest/ I stay away from all these parasites that stay trying to kill us/ While you little n—s out in the club, I’m cosy in bed/ With my Puerto Rican mami that sound like Rosie Perez / How the fuck did they let Corona get spread?/ Why you think I’m masked up? Can’t let it go to my head.” Musically, the songs are built on warm, melodic keyboard and piano loops, which Statik occasionally spikes with velvety vocal samples (the strongest example is the scat singing he layers throughout “This Too Shall Pass.”) The only track that departs from the album’s relaxed vibe is “Morphine,” which provides a jolt of energy via a chopped-up orchestral hit and the rowdy energy of M.O.P.’s Lil Fame. “I spit fire, y’all can’t deny it/ Y’all fold under pressure, I was taught to apply it/ Spazmatic, I spazz with it/ See that cloth that you cut from? I wouldn’t wipe my ass with it.” In these uncertain times, there is indeed comfort in the fact that not even shelter in place orders can stop Lil Fame’s boasting.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}

An East Coast indie rock alumnus who resettled to the majestic Pacific Northwest, Silverstein funnels the vistas of his new home, his humbling experiences as a special-education teacher, and the mantric repetition of endurance sports into these nine gentle pieces. They collectively unspool with the warmth of a deep yawn. Traced by pedal steel’s amber glow and anchored by simple programmed beats, Silverstein sings of sweet dogs he’s known with a wry twinkle that recalls David Berman, and slides through scenic instrumentals with the easy grace of an Econoline Bill Frisell. But in our actual time,     feels instead like a daily ritual, a 38-minute sun salutation that leaves you with welcome stockpiles of fleeting feelings, like worth or meaning. Browsing the flotsam of a yard sale, Silverstein found a stack of used tapes by mindfulness guru Jon Kabat-Zinn, which he samples alongside clips of happy children playing during the opener “A Dog’s Age,” a song that radiates the comfort of an old friend’s smile. “As you sit here, you share in the massiveness and the stillness and the majesty of the mountain,” Kabat-Zinn says near the song’s end, the guitars trailing around him like cloud wisps. “You become the mountain.” This sense of pleasant affirmation ripples through the rest of the record, from the instrumental exhalation of “Door at the Top of Your Head” to the guileless beauty of “Easy Rider,” where Silverstein sweetly intones koans about being kind to yourself and your future prospects. “Turn yourself into a passing cloud,” he sings at one point, his tender voice draped over bulbous country bass and pedal steel lines that suggest an endless horizon. “Something of which you’re proud.” Maybe that sounds a little cheesy, like a cynic’s stereotype of a New Age type. Sure, it is—but it’s also so beautiful and disarming that you want to sit still with Silverstein if only for a moment, taking the time to believe in something better than the day’s dread.", "genre": []}

On their third full-length album,  , Sotomayor nails a dynamic and accessible pop sound without sacrificing complexity. The recipe? Strong pop vocals in tandem with inventive, dance-oriented electronic beats. Their ambitious sound is a mixture of influences from across the Latin music spectrum, drawing inspiration from dancehall, cumbia, merengue, Afrobeat and a variety of other genres, and is written entirely in Spanish. There’s an undeniable commercial quality to their music, but it’s delivered with striking soul. There’s a hypnotic quality to the songs on  . A large part of this is Paulina’s captivating vocals, which can morph from breathy like in “Tu Cuerpo y el mío” to commanding like on “Latin History Month,” over the course of the record.

Album closer “Ella,” is expansive; the pace significantly slowed with a sparing beat that’s more atmospheric and spatial while Paulina stretches out her words rather than her quick fire delivery in the preceding songs.

{"album": "The Experience of Repetition as Death", "artist": "Clarice Jensen", "description": "The music of cellist and composer   is so immersive, it’s easy to just get lost in it. Her patient “Cello Constellations”—as one early track title describes them—float on waves of bowed strings. But Jensen’s work has a lot of other levels too, be they intellectual, thematic, or emotional. That’s more true than ever on her latest release,  the title of which reflects the record’s the deep conceptual underpinnings. Here, Jensen doesn’t just use recurring motifs, she grapples with the fundamental cycle of mortality.  The word “death” in the album title is not just a metaphor. Jensen wrote much of this album when her mother was dying of leukemia—a time filled with the repetition of errands, doctor visits, and the omnipresent bleats of hospital equipment. The latter influenced the hypnotic “Metastable,” in which Jensen’s cello swings gently between high and low pitches, slowly building intensity yet never wavering from its steady pulse. That intensity ratchets up in the drama of the next track, “Holy Mother.” Though the title of this massive piece is taken from the Tibetan name for the similarly-massive Mount Everest, it’s hard not to also hear in the track’s organ-like tones an elegy to Jensen’s own parents. Such layered themes are strengthened by the way Jensen returns to specific musical figures throughout  , especially in the album’s circular beginning and end. Opener “Daily” uses a simple chord progression that continually rises, and closer “Final” reiterates the phrase from tape loops that Jensen created in the studio—but only after she deliberately degraded them by crumpling and even stepping on them. The track’s murky feel slowly fades to reveal a pure, majestic version of Jensen’s theme. By ending where she began, Jensen offers both resolution and hope, suggesting that if death is bound to repeat, so too is life.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

By assembling a cast of characters whose music is defined—in many ways—by their unconventional approach to rhythm,   feels more physical than the chapters that preceded it. Nmesh’s “Cimcool 15KV Distribution” lays vocal snippets ripped from sci-fi films over a drum track that pirrups and rat-a-tats relentlessly—near the 2:30 mark, it approaches the kind of bass-heavy wallop the Bomb Squad would have lent to a classic Public Enemy record. Mukqs, the musical alias of   Max Allison, contributes a characteristically hectic piece, bouncing a high-pitched synth tone across a skull-splitting bass drum. Even Diamondstein and Sangam, whose work tends toward drifting ambiance, turn in a piece defined by its scrambling, nearly drum & bass, percussion track. There are moments of reprieve. Pale Spring, whose   was one of last year’s quiet delights, turns in the elegant torch song “Dripping,” and Pauline Lay’s album-closing “Mornings By the Sea,” where rippling keys float against empty air, has the tranquility of a closing prayer.

On bouncy dance track “Everything is Fine,” Sommes both complements and then disrupts the propulsive beat with a piano solo and barrage of drums.

A tight and interesting band from the beginning, lié feel like they’ve grown into themselves, sprawling out beyond their reference points to become a true force to be reckoned with.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"]}
{"album": "The Weather Up There", "artist": "Jeremy Cunningham", "description": "Released 12 years after his brother Andrew was killed in a 2008 home invasion, Chicago drummer and composer Jeremy Cunningham’s latest album   is a sonically rich and emotionally cathartic exploration of grief and love.  The album’s opener “Sleep” begins with a recording of Cunningham’s aunt talking about being visited by a mysterious figure in a dream. Questioning the identity of this dream visitor, his mother asks; “I wonder if that was Andrew stopping by to say goodbye to me. I truly believe that was him.” The guitar and electric piano on “1985” meld to create a jaunty, playful bit of jazz-rooted pop nostalgia. The introspective “Hike,” with it’s gorgeous, sweeping melody, and the chaotic, harrowing cut “All I Know,” make   is a bittersweet endeavor. At times, Cunningham’s music is lush and optimistic, painted in the cool, rich emotional tones of nostalgia and memory. At others,  is a reminder of the gaping emotional hole and trauma that death and violence can leave, affecting not only the victims themselves, but the families and communities that love them.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}
{"album": "From Avoca Hills to the World", "artist": "Citizen Boy & Mafia Boyz", "description": " details the rise of   (a strain of South African electronic music) through the eyes of one of its main proponents: Citizen Boy, a 21 year-old producer and founding member of the Mafia Boyz crew. It’s a fascinating journey, featuring tracks written before, during, and after Gqom achieved international acclaim. The collection’s earliest track, 2013’s “Uhuru,” offers a glimpse at a sound still in its infancy. The song is sparsely arranged: a multi-tonal “guiro” and a skittering kick-drum lay the foundation for most of the six minutes, while an underdeveloped drone and the occasional vibraslap add light detail. Structurally, it is unpredictable; harmonically, it is bare; yet emotionally, it evokes the introspective nature of a teenage producer in a dark bedroom in post-Apartheid South Africa. Compared to tracks from 2017 and ‘18, there’s a noticeable tenderness to “Uhuru” that has—over time—been replaced by bolder, brasher sounds with more urgency and forward momentum. “Dark City” from 2017 retains the brooding and hypnotic nature of earlier material, but adds movement and mutation—the drone pushes and pulls, reaching a lofty pinnacle at the end of each eight-bar phrase, before a new percussive element is elegantly introduced. Generally, when fringe musical movement makes inroads into the mainstream, the qualities that made it so remarkable in the first place become diluted in order to appeal to the largest possible audience. There’s none of that on   if anything, the sound has only gotten more frenetic. Citizen Boy maintains the spirit, style, and ethos of Gqom; if he attracts a following, it will be on his own terms.", "genre": ["World", "Electronic"]}

While it may seem like every UK or US-based artist one reads about these days is “responding to our political reality,” Leeds-based quartet Mush fit into a long tradition of critically-minded post-punk, and they’re ready to vent their frustrations with their lives using sharp words and music that feels as off-kilter as the world around them. On their debut full-length,  , Mush leans further into experimentation than on their previous EP  , like a jammy, more rock n’ roll cousin of Trash Kit.

Long-running opener “Revising My Fee” is classic post-punk, with a driving bass line and lyrics bemoaning a constant state of debt. In its last two minutes, the guitar fights to out-weird itself, with bending notes, feedback, and blunt noise. The album gets a bit more tame mid-way through, with the soft “Fruits of the Happening” and the proggy title track.

The Brooklyn group Parlor Walls channel that spirit on their latest LP   creating a type of music that they call “anti-melody.” The duo of Alyse Lamb and Chris Mulligan have retained the throbbing percussion and sheets of sound that characterized their 2018 EP   but here, they’ve stripped it down to a kind of raw, instinctive energy.  thrives on a tension that’s never resolved. The thundering drum patterns on opening track “Birds of Paradise” recall the ritualistic beats   summoned for The Creatures, hammering away beneath tight, stabbing guitars and a low, persistent drone. Lamb’s vocals swing from beckoning to threatening; on “Lunchbox,” over queasy keys and hammering drums, she menacingly repeats, “Is it power you adore? Or is it love you are after?” By contrast, on “Violets”—the closest the album comes to a pop song—she playfully alternates between Tina Weymouth-style speak-singing and a gentle melodic croon. And on closing track “Rails,” her voice floats eerily over a raucous industrial pulse and gnarled tangles of guitar. Moments like these suggest Parlor Walls aren’t  “anti-melody;” but they retain enough of no wave’s oppositional spirit that even at their sunniest, they’re only seconds away from a storm.", "genre": ["Alternative", "no wave"]}

Active in the music scene of Goiânia since he was 15 years old, Kastelijns set out to create music that would open his heart to the world outside—to reflect his desire to be part of something more spiritual, something bigger than himself.

When Meg Duffy, the L.A.-based musician who records as Hand Habits, was writing songs for their sophomore album  , record-breaking wildfires were ripping across the state—the Mendocino Complex, Woolsey, and Camp fires of 2018 were the deadliest and most destructive in California’s history. “I remember walking around with a cup of coffee and seeing ashes fall into my coffee,” they told  . “I had never been so aware of the environment.” Thanks to climate change, California’s fire season is now year-round, a “new normal” that, as David Wallace-Wells writes in  , is a kind of illusion; it is “the end of normal; never normal again.” In a note for the   EP, Duffy writes that, between gas-guzzling vans, intercontinental airplane rides, and end-of-night Solo cup clean-up, being a touring musician is “often not the most environmentally conscious career.” In search of some helping hands, Duffy enlisted fellow musicians like Angel Olsen and Tara Jane O’Neil to put their own spins on the title track and has partnered with Bandcamp and Saddle Creek, with all proceeds from the EP going to the Amazon Conservation Organization. Hand Habits’ original track is a piece of simmering Americana. Duffy’s singing—“California / Only one who knows / How to burn without desire”—is enveloped in the heat-haze of Brad Cook’s production. The track’s basic elements, from the dirge-like pacing to the isolated and lonely voice, remain on every cover, but are transformed with jaunty lounge piano flair on one track and overwhelming digital distortion on another. Angel Olsen isolates a rear-view sadness with just her voice and pedaled piano chords, while Kacey Johansing channels the song’s romantic notes into dreamy ’60s country. There is something clarifying in hearing the same themes inhabited by so many different voices, lending a certain particularity to Duffy’s purposefully-vague lyrics. But no matter the dressing, the song’s drama remains the same, and no matter how many times the singer refuses to tell us “where it all ends up,” their end feels pre-determined: in “wildfire / wildfire.”", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Opening track “Around” introduces a theme of longing that forms the emotional crux of the first half of the 11 track project, mixed by   of Warp Records. “You shouldn’t have been around / Shouldn’t have been around,” LA Timpa repeats to a lost lover in a pained falsetto that swirls around airy swathes of synths punctuated by percussive laser pulses. Across the album, LA Timpa’s innovative production excels at blending ambient percussive touches with tranquil melodies, like on “Give” where the song opens with a haze of discordant hiss and buzz before giving way to an undulating guitar refrain. “Core” delves into shoegaze territory as Timpa vows “I’ll reach for your love” over soothing waves of guitar; “Fertile” is fueled by a busy series of haptic-sounding taps and beeps; and both “Backyard Exotic” and “Rattle Shake” employ subtle wind chimes to usher in a feeling of serenity that balances out lyrics about pain and confusion. “Leave it alone / It’s all inside my head,” LA Timpa says on penultimate track “Tried Ice,” addressing his internal doubts, before returning to romantic yearning on “Memory Phone,” where, over plaintive synths, he realizes that rosy memories of a relationship are often incompatible with cold reality.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

{"album": "Land of No Junction", "artist": "Aoife Nessa Frances", "description": "As its title suggests, this sumptuous, riveting debut from the Irish songwriter Aoife Nessa Frances explores life’s challenges—the kinds of situations that have no clear solution or path forward. She sets these unflinching examinations of existential roadblocks against a rich palette of crashing drums, sweeping guitars, dramatic strings, and her own cascading voice, providing a balm for the heartbreak at hand. She has a spectacular collaborator in multi-instrumentalist and co-producer Cian Nugent; together, they frame her world-weary narratives in a wide range of dazzling and detailed settings. Opening track “Geranium” embraces a skeletal drum machine and a slight, glimmering guitar figure before blossoming gently outwards with the aid of a laconic lap steel. “Here In The Dark” hums along like an apolitical cousin of “Karma Police,” complete with a plunking bass and murmurs of atmospheric noise. The elegiac title track floats on a magic carpet of viola, courtesy of Ailbhe Nic Oireachtaigh, while “Libra” offers an unexpected slice of jittery surf-rock. Yet it is Frances’ majestic voice, commanding and pained in equal measure, that elevates these songs to the realm of the sublime. In her eyes, hearts are “elastic,” and nothing is certain. “All our answers have disappeared,” she sings on “Libra,” effectively summarizing the terror of living on shaky ground. On “Blow Up,” she is, simply, “tired of being human,” and later, when she opens her eyes in the dark of morning, yearning for clarity, “my eyes can’t see what I feel.” Cynics are often characterized as disgruntled optimists; throughout  , Aoife Nessa Frances highlights both her aspirations, and her hurt, with a singular grace.

{"album": "Bad Ambassadors", "artist": "Bad Ambassadors", "description": "Trying to stay grounded while gentrification is swallowing the city around you is a dominant concern on Bad Ambassadors’ six track self-titled EP. Vocalist Rich Jones and producer Walkingshoe recorded the album in a basement studio in Chicago’s Avondale neighborhood—a majority-Hispanic community that’s under siege from real estate developers creeping in from the next door, and now-gentrified, Logan Square neighborhood. On “Pardon,” over a stripped-down backdrop of aqueous bass and ominous hand claps, Jones documents the way construction rips apart a community’s soul: “Let the sounds of progress sink in / A skyline no longer mine, at least not the way it was,” he sings, “New neighbors, same neighborhood? Nope / Labor under delusions that change is just fine / They don’t ask for opinions—yours or mine.” Walkingshoe’s shape-shifting production serves to accent Jones’s verse, often transforming in style mid-song. Opener “Who Me” blends acoustic guitar with a breakbeat that’s reminiscent of early Beck; “Mornings With You” begins as a pulsing four-to-the-floor workout before becoming the sort of sultry electronic R&B ballad Timbaland perfected around the turn of the millennium. The constantly moving backdrop subtly reflects Jones’s lyrics about the changing environment around him. The album’s theme culminates on closer “Saturday,” featuring extended organ lines that waver up and down, managing to sound both mournful and soothing. “Summer hasn’t been summer for far too long,” he says, struggling to hold on to the things that are dearest to him: “Though you’re right beside me, I cannot reach out / For fear that you would disappear, disappear.”", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

{"album": "There Is No Year", "artist": "Algiers", "description": "2017’s , the second album from the Atlanta group Algiers, was a righteous explosion of sound, its songs touching everything from classic soul to grinding electronic music to the razor’s edge of the avant-garde. Lyrically, the group was just as pointed, tackling the failure of capitalism, the rise of fascism, and the necessity of response on personal and global fronts. Their latest,  , produced by Randall Dunn and Uniform’s Ben Greenberg, opts for a slightly sleeker approach; the music here often feels more ruminative, but it’s no less committed to a fierce critique of the world’s corroded state. The cold electronics and goth/industrial elements of their earlier work remain crucial—which the album-opening title track makes clear from its opening notes—while the stark guitar on “Repeating Night” gives the song a beautifully gloomy feel. Franklin James Fisher’s fierce sing/shout vocal style gives the songs an immediate humanity, striking a balance between oration and a thoughtfulness. (The chorus of “Hour of the Furnaces”—“We all step into the fire”—makes for a thrilling, unnerving high point.) Drummer Matt Tong delivers an exquisite combination of analog and digital rhythms, while Fisher, Ryan Mahan, and Lee Tesche flesh out the arrangements using sharp bursts of guitar and thick bass. The end result are anthems like the ever more tightly winding “Chaka”—which includes one hell of a sax break—and the slow-burner “Dispossession,” which is punctuated by occasional  breaks from Fisher. Meanwhile songs like the piano-centered poison ballad “Losing Is Ours” and the high stakes “Nothing Bloomed” serve as both a reminder of—and a riposte to—the ever-growing sense of ominousness that has become a characteristic of our time.  ", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "Scis” and “Eksploio", "artist": "Oval", "description": "The music Markus Popp makes as   is in part about the act of listening. His tracks—“experimental” to be sure, but otherwise difficult to classify in terms of genre—are defined by how they focus attention, zooming in to assess the most minute detail of a sample one moment and zooming out to showcase the latticework construction of the whole the next. Popp forces the listener to think about how they process sonic information, but his work also happens to be inviting no matter what intellectual engagement one brings to it. The two newest Oval releases, the   EP and the album  , are the product of the ideas that have defined the project all along, but Popp continues to add new wrinkles. To understand how we got here, it helps to take a step back. Oval’s recorded output can be divided into several distinct phases. The project’s earliest work was decidedly ambient but with a discomfiting edge, as soothing hums and digital clicks and buzzes interrupted drones. Starting around the time of 1999’s   EP, Popp added noise and distortion, and the music became aggressive and overwhelming while keeping elements of conventional melodic beauty. After a long break from Oval in the 2000’s, Popp returned in 2010 with  , which found him inhabiting a world of clean tones that referenced recognizable instruments—even as his compositional structures remained wild and unpredictable.   and   are part of a more recent phase that finds Oval in a dreamier realm; Popp builds pieces from small fragments that he arranges for maximum emotional engagement, creating a kind of kaleidoscope of color in sound.  has an almost classical bearing, with bits of piano and orchestral sounds that lend drama. One can sense the hand of a composer; the random element, always present with Oval, sits more in the background. “Eksploio” has string-like synth parts, reminiscent of ‘90s chill rooms, and a rush of low-end energy that is recognizably percussive. It’s unusually musical for Oval. “Blissous” has a chattering series of taps sourced from the highest few keys on the piano, giving the twitchy and beat-heavy electronics a wooden earthiness. And “Brockaat” is among the most tuneful tracks Popp has created, with a simple two-note melodic refrain anchoring the piece and foregrounding glimmering trills of xylophone. If   is disarmingly pretty,  ’s defining characteristics are rhythm and noise. That push and pull of opposing forces, where the most delicate bits of melody—a sampled guitar, a shard of piano, a small fragment of voice—compete for space with a deep bass rumble that’s hard to pry apart, is the essence of the album. The opening “Twirror” is packed with distorted drones and squeaks that function almost like power chords, while a heavy quake of electronic percussion adds tension underneath. “Pushhh” features a chaotic series of drum hits driving the beat under noisy synths, but also has a traditional backbeat, something of a rarity in the Oval world; “Robussy” is another track with a hypnotically throbbing bottom octave. Beats are often out front on  , but Popp’s drum programming isn’t tied to any particular musical idiom. Though the music is tethered to a steady pulse, percussion, for Popp, is ultimately another tool for density and space. If this pair of records is an early glimpse at the next phase of Oval’s sound, it’s one with a lot of promise, as both channel his complicated methods into music of rare emotional force.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

{"album": "Musica Infinita", "artist": "Tino Contreras", "description": "For much of his 60-year career, jazz drummer Tino Contreras has stood just outside the spotlight both in his native Mexico and abroad, largely because his music has been tough to pin down. Born in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua in 1924, his professional career didn’t begin until the early 1950’s—first as part of Luis Alcaraz’s Latin swing orchestra, then with pianist Juan García Esquivel. In 1953, Contreras released his first solo album,  , a self-described tropical jazz LP reportedly inspired by a trip he’d taken to the Dominican Republic. In an era of bebop and big band, his sound was more psychedelic, a forward-looking mix of swing, waltz, and American avant-garde.

Then there’s 1960’s “ ” with its pitch-black piano loop and extended drum solo predating Henry Mancini’s “Pink Panther Theme” or Marvin Gaye’s “Trouble Man.” In 1978, working with musical partner Estrella Newman under the group name Quinto Sol (Spanish for “Fifth Sun”), Contreras released   one of his boldest albums. The project—heavily influenced by the Aztec calendar—is based around the idea of the  , an object said to document the Earth’s transformation.

On their second album,   bassist/guitarist Neil Innes, drummer Joost Hendrickx, and reedman Pete Williams, don’t stray too far from the basics; their songs feature snaking woodwind melodies and weightless vibraphone and organ wedded to cracking funk grooves. “Opening Titles” is underpinned by a high-tension rhythm that brings to mind the soundtrack work of Lalo Schifrin and Quincy Jones. “Crossing The Rope-Bridge” feels loose at first, but the band carefully ratchets up the atmosphere and tension until the drums combust. “Summoning The Monkey God” builds from a sinewy bass line, peppering in exotic percussion until it reaches a smoldering soul-jazz peak. Imagining a world where moody film scores from the ‘70s and vintage Ethio-jazz can commingle, the Sorcerers’ aural magic lies in their ability to bring it all to life in the moment.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

Matthias Debusschere (bass), Falk Schrauwen (percussion), and Frederik Van den Berghe (drums) provide the foundation, and Joachim Cooder adds a low-key layer of electric mbira on a few tracks. Authenticity takes a backseat to shadowy pleasures. There’s darkness on the edge of the township, and the wheels come off at some point in nearly every track. You’ll get caught up in the otherwise jaunty yacht groove of “Miami New Wave,” or the Turkish reggae of “10 Dollar Jean Jacket,” before you begin to notice the shadows. The deliciously dark “11 Dollar iPhone” segues smoothly into “Mogadishu,” where Martin Denny-esque   is enlivened with Somalian musical flourishes. Unlike Marc Ribot’s Cubanos Postizos, to whom the band is regularly compared, Compro Oro doesn’t adhere to any particular canon.   their 2015 debut, sounded less anxious overall—and at least a couple of their new songs, including “Dark Crystal,” which proceeds in a languorous 6/8 semi-rumba rhythm, and “Baobab,” which ruminates on rumba’s West Africa adventures, are downright lovely. By concluding  with the sparse, sinister “Kruitvat” (Powder Keg), however, Compro Oro remind us that ever artificial paradise has its artificial inferno.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Odds Against Tomorrow", "artist": "Bill Orcutt", "description": "When guitarist   returned to music at the end of the last decade, he reframed his distinctive style to fit a new context. In the experimental post-hardcore outfit Harry Pussy, his playing was jagged and chaotic, with atonal shards of sound that hit like a protracted explosion. Working solo on 2009’s  , some things changed and some didn’t. Orcutt still treated notes like an action painter does colors, splattering them everywhere so that the patterns only become discernible when you take in the whole. But now he was a guy alone in a room with an acoustic, which lent the fiery compositions intimacy and made the emotional expression more direct. Ten years and several terrific albums later, Orcutt has refined his approach even further. The primary shift on   is to take the intensity of his earlier work and, rather than distribute the force amongst hundreds of notes, channel it into just a few. While this is Orcutt’s quietest and most lyrical solo release, it still throws off sparks. On “The Conversion Experience,” he works horizontally, probing at first, finding his footing, piling on a cluster of tones and then pulling them away as the music retreats to silence. “A Writhing Jar” touches on classical minimalism, with a hypnotic throb of strums coursing through it, which Orcutt then attacks from multiple angles. “Stray Dog” makes the record’s blues undercurrent explicit, as he bends his strings into whimpers, cries, and howls of triumph.  While these surges of energy are exhilarating, the album’s dominant mood is one of weary resignation that bleeds into sadness. The aching “Moon River” wrings every drop of feeling from the iconic melody, and the closing “Man Dies” closes on an elegiac note, suggesting that, true to its melancholy title, the smart money is on oblivion.   extends Orcutt’s brilliant run and is the perfect starting point for those new to his work.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Networker", "artist": "Omni", "description": "On their first two albums, the Atlanta post-punk group Omni harnessed jerky guitars, plucky bass, and crackling drums to convey a sense of unease. On  , their first release for Sub Pop, the group continues to explore the malaise of modern living, but this time, they’ve swapped jittery post-punk for full-bodied rock arrangements. As a result, the anxiety that permeates their prickly songs is mostly felt in their perceptive—and often downright terrifying—lyrics. Throughout  , Omni open windows into a series of morbid scenarios. “Courtesy Call” has the violence and bleak humor of a Tarantino film: a school teacher gets burned alive by their students, leaving behind only the keys to their SUV. (“The reason why the person is not getting a courtesy call is that they’re dead,” guitarist Frankie Broyles deadpanned in a  ). “Sincerely Yours” offers an equally eerie, but less dramatic, account of the soul-sucking nature of corporate employment (“At happy hours we talk and talk / Are you nervous for your career?”), recalling The National at their most class-conscious. Later, “Flat Earth” presents a contemporary take on the old adage “ignorance is bliss,” complete with an excess of definitely-not-organic blue cocktails. These hair-raising narratives take place against a backdrop of grand rock and roll. “Skeleton Key,” for instance, channels the Southern-fried exuberance of Big Star, and the loopy “Underage” evokes Stephen Malkmus at his most whimsical. On the subdued title track, perhaps the album’s biggest surprise (and delight), a vast array of smoldering synths and Television-style riffs create a cozy backdrop for the devastating central lyric at the album’s core: “Is this digital you?” Despite the substantial dose of existential dread coursing through  , Omni can’t help but sound like they’re enjoying themselves—which, in turn, makes their grim outlook all the more gripping.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Introducing", "artist": "Bokoya", "description": "The German jazz quartet Bokoya likes to say they create music as if each musician “grew up inside a drum machine.” In practice, the crew from Cologne—which includes keys, trumpet, bass and drums—improvise in jam sessions until they lock into a groove, playing in the style of a looped-up soul or jazz break before switching things up again. Bokoya’s on-the-fly way of recording makes their debut album,  , sound like a live beat tape taking shape in real time. The two minute “Lizard” is a potent snapshot of Bokoya’s creative process in action. It opens with a mix of dissonant keys courtesy of Darius Held and lonesome trumpet played by Ferdinand Schwarz. The combination conjures up a sound that sounds fitting for the soundtrack of a ghost town movie scene. “Lizard” closes with a dramatic change into a boisterous workout fueled by Leon Raum’s powerful rattling drums and Lukas Wilmsmeyer’s monstrous bass line. The constantly morphing nature of the songs on   imbues the album with an organic energy. Fresh layers and new musical interactions are continually being revealed. A distorted horn line on the funk-infused “Bills” gives way to squelching dabs of bass; lingering swathes of muted trumpet on the slow burning “Pharao” are followed by echo-inflected guitar; and pensive piano lines and cosmic synths take turns playing center stage on the celestial sounding “Beedis.” By the time the drum ’n’ bass-styled closing cut “After Picture Dance” fades out,   has proved itself a funky experiment in blurring the lines between improvisation and composition.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}
{"album": "Subservient", "artist": "Larry Gus", "description": "Greek producer Panagiotis Melidis has always known his way around a sample. As  , he spent the first half of the decade weaving colorful, dense collages incorporating everything from Afrobeat to Greek folk. He threads these tapestries with an uncannily elastic voice (his moniker is a play on “larygas,” the Greek word for “larynx”), that whirls around the samples in a panicked orbit, like an anxious Avalanches.   Melidis’s first album since 2015, marks an evolutionary turning point in the Larry Gus saga: a tightly-wound pop LP built from scratch, with no outside samples. From the moment “Total Diseases” tumbles in, its clattering drum beat tussling with plush, syncopated synthesizer swirls,   offers pop music that’s as luxurious as it is agitated.  Songs like “Taped Hands Here,” “The Sun Sections,” and the Greek pop-inflected “Classifying A Disease” expand upon this contrast even further, as Melidis establishes tense atmospheres slowly and methodically, as if putting together a jigsaw puzzle while simultaneously doling out some of his strongest hooks and vocals to date. With less samples comes more sonic space, and accordingly, more rhythmic niches for Gus to explore: on “In This Position,” and the breathless closer “Bare Concrete (Itea 97-09),” flurries of drums fill in the space typically occupied by a borrowed snippet. These are risky tradeoffs for a sample-centric artist like Gus, for sure, but   is the kind of breakthrough that makes those risks worth it.", "genre": []}

That’s not where the astronomical theme and lexicon on the album ends, though. Most song titles keep the album name and add a number at the tail end; these are generally the less-abrasive pieces, meditating on a theme, getting as close to ambient music as   wants to get. The tracks with deviating titles are two of the most dynamic. Penultimate track “Black Transit Of Jupiter’s Third Satellite,” the album’s biggest highlight, takes the listener through a caustic 12-minute odyssey of dense, abrasive synthesis—any smooth sine waves to be heard are buried fairly deep. If “Black Transit Of Jupiter’s Third Satellite” is the final push, then final track “Occulting Disk 8” is the denouement, a five-minute undulating drone that crescendos gently before rolling back, allowing the listener to reflect on what’s gone before—the will and energy of ritual and creation—prior to the silence, waiting for the universe’s response.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Athena", "artist": "Sudan Archives", "description": "On her previous releases — her 2017 self-titled EP and 2018’s   — Sudan Archives created works of experimental sound with little more than her violin, loop pedals, and an iPad. But on her new full-length debut,  , the musician, songwriter, and producer (born Brittney Denise Parks) takes her knack for sound manipulation to new heights. She creates a distinctly orchestral sound, layering violin and strummed guitar over choirs of her own voice, and incorporating digital clinks, rumbling bass, and quietly building synths. Working with producers like Washed Out, Paul White, and Rodaidh McDonald, on  , Parks luxuriates in a fuller, R&B and pop-influenced sound, using it as a backdrop to explore the concept of duality.  As an identical twin, duality is a subject that has long been in the back of Parks’s mind. On  , she tackles the concept with incisiveness. “He can make you stay/ He can make you go/ Now you’re stuck,” she sings on the dark interlude “Stuck.” Later, on the sonically brighter “Limitless,” she sings, “It’s OK to be afraid/ Feeling stuck, unlucky, OK/ You’re the only great escape.” This kind of call-and-response appears throughout the album, in lighter, more hopeful, songs like “Confessions” and moodier tracks like “Black Vivaldi Sonata” and “Green Eyes,” which tackle the haunting nature of relationships.

Strings weave in and out of his gear again on “Anasickmodular,” but Shepherd keeps accelerating the pace until it bursts into a full on dance track. “Environments” has all the wistful melancholia of classic Boards of Canada, but Floating Points pairs it to a tricky rhythmic pattern that seriously knocks.

Arriving at the tail end of the Cold War,   captures the night that Sun Ra and his Arkestra performed behind the Iron Curtain as part of the 13th annual International Jazz Piano Festival. Opening with the nearly 15-minute long tone-setter “Infinity Drum Intro/Discipline 27-ll,” the Arkestra immediately leapt into a frenzy, building up and deconstructing lengthy passages of open-ended sound positioned against frantic free-soloing. It’s hard to imagine this music not challenging the audiences expectations and endurance.  With an ensemble a dozen players strong, including Arkestra mainstays such as John Gilmore, Marshall Allen, Danny Ray Thomspon and others, the Arkestra is particularly muscular and fluid. Throughout the set, the band proves equally capable of moving between different styles like the swinging, unorthodox bop of “I’ll Never Be The Same,” to their lighthearted take on the vocal jazz standard “Mack The Knife.” The now-classic Arkestra tune “Children Of The Sun” also appears here in all its buoyant, celebratory glory. Bold and swinging, the song is an ecstatic and joyous look into the future. Tapping into the deep, emancipating optimism that lies at the core of the Arkestra’s identity, the band swings with great zeal, complete with Sun Ra promising listeners that “Things ain’t never gonna be like they used to be!

Ambient music in a meditative state in mind,   is the sum of two perfect parts: guitarist Chuck Johnson and synth/piano/organ sculptor Marielle Jakobsons. Both are solo artists who released stellar records in recent years ( ,  ), but here they sound as if they’ve been a band for at   a decade. As Johnson recently put it on  , “This is the most fruitful musical collaboration I have ever had.” While their last recording was inspired by the reduced visibility and heightened rhythms of whiteouts,  embodies a graceful into-the-great-wide-open ethos, wrapping Johnson’s wistful pedal steel parts around Jakobsons’ astral projections with an innate sense of space and time. By letting each of their elements breathe, and bringing Jakobsons’ moonlit vocal melodies into the mix on two occasions (“Into the Wind,” “Void”), Saariselka doesn’t feel like a collaboration between dueling forces, but a fully formed entity, channeling the sublime moments of stillness and peace.

{"album": "Dark Thoughts", "artist": "The Shivas", "description": "Here’s a dark thought: if there is a genius in being aware of your own limitations, then the only reason garage rock isn’t full of geniuses is because the bands stop being garage once they start attempting to do anything intellectual with a genre that’s raw power springs from its “anyone can do it” anti-elitism. Witness the number of early 2010s garage bands now putting out double LPs of thinky prog or synth-punk. Portland band the Shivas land solidly on the “punk” side of the garage spectrum on fifth LP  , where the band settle in for a solid set of righteous three-chord wonders delivered with a mean streak that will always be to the tastes of a certain doomy subset of ‘60s rock fans. There’s a ritualistic quality to the way the band whips themselves into a spectral sonic frenzy on every track, regardless of tone or tempo. Though the Shivas are here for the party, there are no sunshine sounds to be found, even when the band is proclaiming the joys of listening to the radio (“Playing on the Radio”) with lots of “Ba ba ba’s” in the chorus for everyone to sing along with. They also leave little room for bad vibes or fresh air while barreling through the many colorful moving parts of the blaringly wet and blown-out rave up “Feels Surreal.” But   is distinguished exactly by being 99% squall. “Lush” wouldn’t be a terrible word for the atmosphere the group conjures, if it weren’t for all the clanging guitars, layered, howling vocals and pounding drums that give the whole thing a cranked-up, ceremonial feel—the kind that asks full buy-in from listeners in return for a full dose. Yet the Shivas’ ability to corral such cacophony into songs full of propulsive groove and melodic throttle is their greatest strength as a unit, and they do so with obvious delight on the clamorous, catchy and discomfiting “Can’t Relax.“ Another highlight is drummer Kristin Leonard’s delivery of the drippy doo-wop torch ballad “If You See Me.” She’s got the pipes for the kind of unabashedly dramatic showing the song requires, and her warbling, sunken vocals creep slowly up to a dramatic belt that’s thrilling in its open-hearted intensity. For all its affected arcane gloom, however,   isn’t especially mysterious—though it does keep one foot in the grave at all times. The Shivas have delivered a banging and old-fashioned good time in a slightly nightmarish sonic playground, rendered vividly enough to show that coloring within the lines can be a kind of art all of its own.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Cairn", "artist": "Mizmor", "description": "Mizmor’s latest full-length,  , is an exercise in extremes. The penultimate song, “Cairn to Suicide,” begins as an extreme metal workout, with double-bass drums and throat-rending shrieks. At the halfway mark, the music comes to a halt; waves of feedback and light industrial touches give way to the 12-minute endurance test’s mellower second half, finishing with a delicate acoustic passage. Take that “endurance test” descriptor to heart: With three of its four songs hitting the 10-minute mark,  ’s prolonged anguish defies casual listening.  One of metal’s great strengths is its willingness to grapple with heavy universal themes, and those weighty topics make up the core of Mizmor’s music. The sole member of the Portland-based project, A.L.N., speaks frankly and frequently about his loss of religious faith; in a   with the artist conducted by singer Emma Ruth Rundle, he framed the 18-minute album highlight “Cairn to God” as a song “about mourning loss of faith in god, and how that was explored for the past seven years.” Fortunately, songs like the opening “Desert of Absurdity” are up to the task of matching those existential woes with equally dismal sounds: high-speed drums, heavy distortion, swelling feedback, and prolonged musical passages played at mollusk-speed.  These ingredients could be jarring in other contexts, but A.L.N.’s compositions convey grief commensurate with life’s toughest struggles.

{"album": "Alefa Madagascar", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": " plays like a highlight reel of Malagasy sounds from the ‘70s and ‘80s—a combination of salegy, soukous, and soul. Album-opener “Jean Kely Et Basth” by Andosy Mora begins with the kind of plush organs that would be fit to score a Sunday sermon. But when the hard drums hit and a fuzzed-out guitar snakes its way in and the organ begins to stutter, the song goes from solemn reserve to a vision of bodies suddenly catching the Holy Spirit. Salegy is one of Madagascar’s most popular forms of dance music, and its roots date back to both ceremonial songs and an ancient ritualistic chants called antsa. Though the musical influences of Kenya, Congo, and Mozambique are apparent, Madagascar’s sound is distinct—a wild blend of funk, psychedelic rock, folk, and dance music. The drums on Andeha Hanarato’s track, “Los Matadores,” march in lockstep with a splayed organ line, that in turn converses with a choir, which translates the organ’s melodies into thick and luscious vocal parts. Mahaleo’s “Izahay Mpamita” mines the folkloric sound that grew from rotaka farmers and student protesters who, in 1972, ousted Madagascar’s first president; a sodina flute (a native Malagasy instrument) sews the acoustic guitar and vocals together like a needle through fabric, floating high-pitched chords over the top. These lesser-known records laid the groundwork for contemporary Malagasy artists like Ali Mourad, Tence Mena, and   Jaojoby.

In addition to Hval’s own voice, Vivian Wang, Laura Jean Englert, and Felicia Atkinson contribute vocals, adding sonic complexity, conversations, and even some pseudo-ASMR moments. While  can be pleasant background music if one so chooses, close listening reveals the careful design of the vocal arrangements and the complexity of Hval’s lyrics. Instead of liner notes for this release, Hval wrote poetry; her literary tendencies manifest further on songs like “Accident,” an exercise in eloquent, concise character study (“She is made for other things / Born for cubist yearnings.”) Hval is obsessed with otherness, a theme that she touches on many times across her discography; here, the estrangement is from ideas of love and closeness, as on “Lions,” or the title track’s anti-love treatise. Always questioning what it means to belong (or not), Hval cleverly achieves a kind of intimacy—and claustrophobia—by having the vocalists simultaneously sing different lyrics on these tracks. works when viewed from afar or up close, casually or obsessively.

{"album": "Devour", "artist": "Pharmakon", "description": "Listening to Pharmakon has never exactly been a passive act. Rather than recede into the background, Margaret Chardiet’s savage noise compositions seize you by the shoulders with a violent shake. That sense of urgency is especially apparent on  , her fourth album for Sacred Bones, and the first that fully reflects Pharmakon’s notoriously confrontational live show. (  guitarist Ben Greenberg cut the album’s five corrosive pieces straight to tape in the studio, keeping a set list of sorts in mind for side A and B.) Deepening the album’s darkness is the fact that it’s a concept record about self-cannibalism—the ways in which we ravage both ourselves and the world around us. Or as Chardiet puts it in a potent artist statement, “To be well adjusted in this system is to be oblivious and unfeeling. This is for the rest of us, who understand that chaos, madness, pain and even self-destruction are natural and inevitable responses to an unjust and disgusting world of our own making.”  also documents the ways that empathy—a recurring theme in Pharmakon’s bleak, yet deeply human, catalog—gives way to grief. Each track on  mirrors a different stage of mourning: denial (the churning “Homeostasis”), anger (“Spit It Out,” with its throbbing bass and chainsaw-like feedback), bargaining (the turbine-engine chug of “Self-Regulating System”), depression (“Deprivation,” harrowing in its severity), and acceptance (the scabrous “Pristine Panic / Cheek By Jowl”). This mercurial approach makes for an engaging listen even when Chardiet’s mangled industrial melodies and steam-pressed beats are on full blast, sending high-pitched squeals and waves of static crashing in all directions. Both a cry for help and a call to arms, it’s like being stuck, frantic, on a sinking ship with no shore in sight. But surrender is not the album’s message; if anything, it feels like an angry rebuke to the notion of “Keep Calm and Carry On.” That passivity,   suggests, is deadly.

An intense longing for intimacy, connection, and sensation has always coursed through their records, from the brutally slow post-punk of their debut EP   to the trip-hop textures of 2014’s  . On “Into The Drama,” the opening track to the band’s latest album,  , vocalist Jonnine Standish, accompanied by Nigel Yang’s wide open, flanged acoustic guitar, ponders those internal concerns explicitly. “Why do I seem to fall?” she sings, lamenting a tendency to gravitate towards unhealthy people, to “hang onto every word.” It’s the most pastoral moment the group have ever laid to tape, and serves as a declaration of intent for the album—the most guitar-oriented record they’ve made in years, as well as the best. But there is no trace of the abrasiveness of their earlier work. Instead, Yang’s guitar playing is melodic, textured and nuanced, processed just to the point of estrangement. Whereas HTRK’s previous records conjured a nocturnal atmosphere primed for bedrooms and clubs,   feels remarkably open and unconstrained: a wide, deep LP with room to spare. HTRK have always been excellent curators of atmosphere, conjuring eerily specific moods with minimalist efficiency. But on  , Standish’s narratives of memory and unexpected revelation are given gravity by some of the most beautiful and indelible pop moments of her band’s career. On the penultimate track, “New Year’s Day,” Standish documents a moment of inebriated dread and despair familiar to anyone who’s felt themselves getting older and struggled with their resolutions to grow or improve. The verses are tense, with her terse vocal delivery punctuated by Yang’s humid, chiming guitar. But Standish makes an unexpected leap up for the songs aching resignation of a chorus. “I’ve got a sinking feeling,” she sings, doubled by Yang’s guitar, her voice slipping back down at the word “sinking,” “I’m going to do the wrong thing, eventually.” It’s a stark parallel to the subsequent closer, “New Year’s Eve,” where Standish recalls a youthful, frightened confession of love with a sweet, nursery rhyme melody.

Even when the ending combusts in an explosion of blast beats and shredding guitar, the song still remains transcendent, not aggressive. Album highlight “✓ BEiNG” manages to combine New Age tranquility (complete with bird calls) with distorted spoken word, bombastic guitar solos ripped out of a racing game for the Sega Dreamcast, and paint-stripping shrieks.

Her conspiratorial voice sounds more exposed, her emotions heightened and shivering on the surface, her arrangements stripped down to their barest essentials.   is no exception: Initially released in 2009 as accompaniment to an elaborate book with writing and photos, the full-length exudes a wintry chill, largely due to Hersh’s sandpaper-textured vocal tone and arrangements that convey isolation and weariness. “Flooding” is stark, with mournful cello and plucked acoustic guitar arranged so each strum echoes like ponderous footsteps, while trudging rhythms and biting riffs on “Sand” convey someone on a long, tiring journey. On other songs, however, Hersh—who plays every instrument on the album—uses snaky, bruising electric guitar accents for effect. Sinewy riffs go haywire on “Sand,” like bubbled paint that flake off a wall, while her circuitous melodies on “Rubidoux” are hypnotizing. This 10th anniversary reissue also illustrates the literary bent of Hersh’s lyrics, which often lean on surrealistic imagery to describe painful situations. “Flooding,” a song she has   inadvertently foreshadowed the 2009 suicide of close friend Vic Chesnutt, contains the vivid line, “Like melting you shrugged off the clothes of your life.” “Mississippi Kite” describes a tempestuous relationship through the lens of conflicted nurturing: “I feed you boric acid and air / Lemon drops, snow cream, speckled eggs.” On other songs, however, Hersh uses simple, well-placed words to convey deep meaning. As “Moan” ends, a flurry of distortion gives way to a frazzled waltz as she foggily sings, “I’m jumping out of my skin.” The very next line stresses that this isn’t the first time that’s happened: “I’m jumping out of my skin again.”   is a primal and piercing album that captures the discomfort of emotional and physical disconnection.", "genre": ["Alternative", "singer-songwriter", "indie rock"]}
{"album": "Lookout Low", "artist": "Twin Peaks", "description": "  On their fourth album,  , Twin Peaks sound like they’re having a ball. The Chicago quintet formed in the early 2010’s as a precocious group of teenage garage-rock disciples, and their first few records fit snugly alongside the San Francisco garage revival of the time. But with their 2016 record   the group shifted from stomping fuzz-pop to strolling blues that had more in common with Van Morrison than Ty Segall or Jay Reatard. On  , Twin Peaks double down on that style, finding their sweet spot in a mix of foot-tapping jams and glass-raising ballads. In a concerted effort to capture the freewheeling energy of their live shows, they enlisted English producer Ethan Johns, who’s known for tracking live recordings with arena-sized acts like Paul McCartney and Kings of Leon. Considering that was the goal,  is a monumental success; Twin Peaks radiate the loose confidence of a live band throughout the entire record. Standouts like the breezy “Better Than Stoned” and the funky “Dance Through It” lock into grooves that gradually crescendo into hearty group choruses, surrounded by plunky keyboard solos and warm trumpet gusts, respectively. “Ferry Song” recalls the uplifting tempo and sweet melody of Hall and Oates’ “Rich Girl,” and co-vocalist Colin Croom pays obvious homage to The Band in the folk-rockin’ “Laid In Gold.” But Twin Peaks sound the most comfortable and the most themselves on the album’s title track, a bombastic sing-along that’s speckled with Clay Frankel’s charming “oh’s” and “ow’s” during the song’s generous climax. This latest iteration of the band sounds virtually unrecognizable from their early work, and that may be a turn-off for longtime fans. But Twin Peaks have never sounded as joyfully in the moment as they do on  , and hearing them let it rip in real-time almost makes you feel like you’re up there with them.", "genre": []}

Co-founded by the late Andy Palacio, the collective sings in the endangered Garifuna language, and features Garifuna people from across Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. As a result,   is a vibrant mix of Garifuna and other African diaspora musical traditions.  The lively eight-track album is host to a wide range of Garifuna traditional music, including Wanaragua and the sacred Hüngühüngün. Opening track, “Lügua (Lost),” is a jubilant track with upbeat electric guitar, driven by collective member Marcela Aranda’s inviting voice. The song “Uraga (Story),” blends guitar, Garifuna primero drums, turtle shells, and conch shells to create a steady, percussive beat, while Aranda’s commanding vocals occupy the forefront. The song ends with a field recording taken in 1997 in a Garifuna community in Honduras.

{"album": "Dynasty", "artist": "Hua Li", "description": "Montreal DJ, vocalist, and producer Hua Li’s debut full-length   contains multitudes. It’s part candlelit, champagne-smooth R&B musings on love, sex, and relationships; part lush ‘80s synth-pop dissections of intergenerational trauma and recovery; and part jazzy hip-hop precision and empowerment. It’s all tied together under a sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit anti-capitalist ethic: “Never met a CFO that had me feeling ravenous,” Hua Li sings on “Social Meds.” The record opens with “Paper Sons,” a reference to the strategies used by Chinese immigrants in circumventing racist immigration policy in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. The song begins and ends with clips of Hua Li’s mother, aunt, and grandmother speaking, sampled from voice memos and phone calls. At the end of the first verse, Hua Li calls for solidarity: “We keep it coming like it’s 1965 / Like Huey Newton’s still alive, like AAPA still building ties,” namechecking the socialist Black Panther leader and the anti-imperialist Asian American Political Alliance. “Mr. Greenlight” eviscerates abusive, manipulative white men in power: “Distinguished white man, you always get more / More money, more bitches, more babies, more hitches / Nothing you can’t handle though, never dealt a hand too low.” At the midway point, “Recitation (Interlude)” features collaborator Raquel Wang reciting a poem by Chinese poet Li Bai called “Thoughts On A Still Night” over top of a ricocheting keyboard patch and a recurring sample of someone inhaling sharply. Thematically and texturally, it is a poignant capsule of Hua Li’s work: connections drawn between past and present, ruminations on the inescapable consequences associated with the passage of time. The poem’s last two lines read, “I raise my head and look at the bright moon / I lower my head and think of home.” Somehow, amid all that chaos and tumult, she’s managed to find peace—and this stellar reflection attests to that.", "genre": []}

Their self-titled debut album reflects all of that, and more—funk, Afrobeat, and classic jazz all course through its songs.  In fact, when listening to  , it often feels like the music could go off in any number of directions. The album plays like an experimental jam session, which focus shifting from horns to keys, sometimes breaking way to an interplay between both. On the exuberant single “Nah,” bass gives way to psychedelic organ, before ending with a blast of horns. Skittering without being scattershot, “Nah” encapsulates PYJÆN’s approach to experimental jazz. “Free Your Dreams,” delves further into the brass, and the slower “Steve” diverges from the uptempo sound of the other songs, acting as a laidback meditation. Mellow middle track “Leading the Times” is a standout, boasting a vibrant and ascendent guitar solo, and “Waiting for Perry” is propelled forward with a steady marching beat. Guitar-heavy closer, “In Search of the Sticky Side,” showcases the group’s voices for the first time—an appropriate way to end the album.   delicately melds the group’s diverse tastes and styles to create an undeniable sound. ", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

Their discography is an album-by-album documentation of a manic desire for human connection that invariably leads to the slow unhinging of the ego—and by extension, a constant series of self-destructive choices; this is explored at length on the indelibly sad 2017 album  . On their self-titled, fourth LP, the Seattle band don’t get any closer to clarity, but they do arrive at an emotional détente of sorts: there won’t be   catharsis, at least not yet, or perhaps, never. Chastity Belt’s sound has flattened out since their earliest releases, the sonics becoming more insular as the moods became more nebulous. Here, working alongside producer Melina Duterte of  , the group imbue their songs with a superficial serenity that’s similar in feel to vocalist and guitarist Julia Shapiro’s recent solo record,  . The songs on   flow seamlessly into each other, drifting along on an even ebb of gentle rhythms and even gentler vocals; Shapiro has dropped her bellows and spends more time singing in her higher registers.  ’s placid surface is further emphasized by Shapiro’s tendency to repeat platitudes in her lyrics, almost as if she’s talking to herself. “It takes time to really get it right / Let go of control,” she sings on the dreamy “It Takes Time,” her voice hovering lightly over a lazy looping guitar line as the band sinks into the amorphous atmospherics behind her. But the surface-level tranquility serves only to obscure. Later, on the brutally pretty self-critique “Drown,” Shapiro softly confesses what’s been true all along: “Repeated meaningless words don’t work / Speech is pointless.” There’s nothing glamorous about the personality crisis happening on  : We’re not drowning our sorrows on a Grecian isle, we’re just going to the bar in a Toyota Rav-4 (“Rav-4.”) This is a record about giving up, with no anticipation of better things on the horizon. But at least we’re among friends. Chastity Belt derive their singular strength from group solidarity, and on this self-titled release they circle the wagons in an even more rigid lockstep, their deepening musical bond offering temporary shelter from the perpetual blues. The generosity between the players on   suggests that, if there is any way to be saved from disappearing completely in a lonely world, it’s through the healing energy of the group hug, or, in this case, the rock band.", "genre": []}

But this time, his meditative music serves a more explicit purpose: to help him in his quest for resolution and self-understanding in the fallout of a relationship. On  , Sims balances acoustic and digital instrumentation with finesse and—despite its contemplative and mournful tone—a good deal of playful experimentation. Throughout the album, he channels various artists central to the late ‘00s indie universe: standout track “Reflection,” for instance, brings to mind the ecstatic drumming-round-the-campfire maximalism of Here We Go Magic and early Animal Collective. Later, the gently clattering percussion that forms the backbone of “Monsoon” echoes James Blake’s debut, and “Prayer” embraces a use of empty sonic space that recalls the focused minimalism of the xx. draws strength from its ability to lose itself in repetition. And while Sims’s elegant coo serves as a poignant vehicle for his fraught narratives, he’s most effective when he chants phrases like, “Beauty’s the reflection of your self love” (“Reflection”) or the titular lyric in “Must I”  , until his voice melds into his compositions.

After a two-year break and heavy touring,   (aka Daley Padley) returns with an album that defies expectations.  carries a heavy emotional weight beneath its seductive kick-drums, glistening snares, and perfectly synched 4/4 phrases. Its subtleties can feel hard to pin down, but what’s swimming beneath that gleaming production is the cathartic energy associated with overcoming trauma. The muscular “Buggin’” was an inspired first teaser, but second single “You Are The Light” captures the spirit of the album even better. Featuring U.K. vocalist Jem Cooke, a familiar name for   fans, the track is an uplifting tour-de-force, clocking in at over eight minutes. Cooke’s voice is muddled and pitched down, conveying an androgynous timbre, while the lyrics “You are not your body” chanted repeatedly, work as an incantation. We can read it as getting lost in music through a communal, out-of-body experience, but these lyrics also carry a secondary meaning, expressing a much-needed sense of inclusivity in their push against gender norms. Less obvious numbers like “Tilted,” an ecstatic mid-tempo instrumental with echoing, ghostly voice snippets and dreamy pads, are   hidden strength. This is a soundtrack for the train ride home after the party, flanked by sleepy commuters and fellow ravers with runny mascara.

{"album": "Of the Sun", "artist": "Trupa Trupa", "description": "The reputation of the Gdansk, Poland-based band Trupa Trupa has been growing steadily over the last few years. The group, led by gregarious singer and guitarist Grzegorz Kwiatkowski, has gone from self-releasing albums at the start of the decade to signing to indie label Lovitt in the U.S. (Glitterbeat in the EU) as the ‘10s draw to a close.   draws on wider strands of what could be broadly called “21st century post-rock”—big rhythms courtesy of drummer Tomasz Pawluczuk, a bleak sense of atmosphere that borders on goth, and Rafał Wojczal’s occasional keyboards to add extra heft. Kwiatkowski sings in English throughout, moving from smooth, even uplifting turns on songs like “Longing” to sharper spoken word bits that occasionally call to mind Mark E. Smith. There’s a dark, murky undercurrent running throughout the record; you can hear it in Wojciech Juchniewicz’s murmuring underwater bass break on the queasily pulsing “Mangle,” in the tense guitars in the roiling thunderstorm that is “Remainder,” and in the abstract, Devo-esque herky-jerk of “Turn.” There’s a sense of unsettled disorientation that comes through at other points, too, whether it’s the swooping background textures on “Another Day” or the distant backing vocals that drift through “Long Time Ago” while the band makes more nervous, raucous noise. Even the quieter moments like “Angle” or the semi-ambling lope of “Anyhow” seem like they’re sitting in the shadows of something menacing and indescribable. The epic punch of Trupa Trupa’s songs feels like it has a grimmer edge, one that betrays a sense that things may not be as you want them to be.

{"album": "Parted Plains", "artist": "Ami Dang", "description": "As a Sikh-American musician born and raised in Baltimore, Ami Dang has become extremely adept at   in her music. Her songs take their rhythms and complex melodies from ancient Indian classical music, as well as Punjabi and Bollywood popular music, and combine them with elements of ‘80s and ‘90s electronic music. A talented sitar player, Dang showcased her pop chops on 2016’s  where she mixed traditional Sikh ragas with hip-hop beats, ambient synths, sitar chord progressions, and her distinct voice—she sang in two languages, Punjabi and English. On her newest album,  Dang goes quiet and lets her instruments speak for her, creating emotional and tense compositions that draw inspiration from the four tragic romances of the Punjab tradition—Sohni Mahiwal, Sassi Punnun, Heer Ranjha, and Mirza Sahiba—as well as other Indian folktales. On  Dang creates a dreamscape full of overpowering and beautiful sitar melodies, underscored by subtle, poignant synth lines that can evoke both soothing peace and dangerous tension. An example of this appears in the album’s first two songs, “Raiments” and “Bopoluchi.” The first composition contains beautiful and almost happily nostalgic sounding sitar chords, paired with synth lines that recall ambient heavyweight Ulrich Schnauss and techno fave Roman Flügel. “Bopoluchi” feels like a warning sign: With heavy bass synths a la John Carpenter, sparse melody, and constant repetition, the song feels designed to interrupt the album opener’s dream, intruding instead with dark reality. That tension between ethereality and the darkness turns up throughout the record. “Make Enquiry” is a frenetic, psych-ambient track that could easily soundtrack the climax of a thriller; “Sohni” morphs from a tense sitar melody into a spiritual, almost trance-like exploration. With  Dang has created an intense, deeply moving album that journeys between distinct worlds. By exploring Sikh and Punjab melodies and instruments, and blending them with Western pop and ambient, she’s created an album that stands alone—a canvas for a story that is still yet to be written.", "genre": ["Ambient", "world fusion"]}
{"album": "Astro", "artist": "Mateo Kingman", "description": "Ecuadorian artist Mateo Kingman has spent a considerable amount of time living in the Amazonian town Macas, which is located on the eastern Andean   and is home to the Shuar indigenous communities. But he would be the first to speak of the vast difference between the way he uses traditional music in his productions, and what it means to be a traditional musician. Indigenous rhythms are often associated with a particular event and a specific geographic region. By contrast, Kingman and his fellow artists from ZZK Records’ AYA imprint—including Nicola Cruz, Quixosis, EVHA, and Rio Mira—have tasked themselves with translating these site-specific sounds for global commercial audiences. That process requires swapping hyper-specific musicological contexts for more general psychosomatic “feelings” or universal existential truths. On his sophomore album  , Kingman tackles one of these; the breakdown in separation between the human mind and the universe that surrounds it Where Kingman differentiates himself from his AYA peers is in his rapping, developed in the Quito hip-hop scene that inspired him as a teen. (He’s collaborated on multiple occasions with MC Guanaco of reggae-hip-hop collective Sudakaya, whose oeuvre incorporates “criollismo,” or working class folklorism, in the makeup of his flow.) On  , Kingman employs rap productions featuring notes of traditional music to consider humankind’s relationship to the universe; his bars nod, perhaps, to the African griot tradition, subtly suggesting hip-hop’s status as modern-day chant. Tracks like “Religar” deploy delicate percussion that conjures the Shuar beats with which Kingman previously surrounded himself, dramatically recontextualized in a trap-inspired astral musing. Witness the straightforward folk of “Último Aliento” and the synthetic aria of the LP’s title track for further proof of his reverence for such fusion. By employing this mix of contemporary and ancestral sounds, Kingman draws a straight line between the knowledge of ancestors and today’s existential trip.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}

So, what are you supposed to do when it’s the people you love most who are wronging you? On  , New York songwriter Mal Blum proposes an innovative solution: be empathetic. Loosely speaking, the music on   is power pop, but it’s never beholden to the strict conventions of that genre. Blum’s voice tends to remain in an understated, K Records-style register, delivering lyrics of seething insecurity in a tone that suggests that   know what you did, and they shouldn’t have to get into it. But there’s always a sense that the narrator is as messed up as the ones they’re addressing. As the driving highlight “Well, Fuck” demonstrates, these songs are just as much “fuck me” as they are “fuck you.” The music similarly straddles that line between making friends and taking no prisoners. It’s punk in spirit, but the production is rich and warm, wrapping the power chords and solos in a sunny, welcoming fuzz. At their best, as on the jangly opener “Things Still Left to Say,” they sound like The Buzzcocks, if The Buzzcocks opted for compassion instead of bile. Meanwhile, the quieter moments, like the brooding “Splinter” or the gorgeous verse of “Gotta Go,” reveal the melancholy lurking at the heart of these songs. But it’s Mal Blum’s knack for slant aphorisms and direct vulnerability that get you in the end. Take “See Me,” a roiling punk elegy for the forgotten, downtrodden, and defiant that’s perhaps the album’s biggest highlight. The chorus starts with Blum plaintively muttering a lament that, for trans folk, should sound heart-breakingly familiar: “Why can’t they see me? Why can’t they see me?” Then, with defeat on the horizon, the band shoot back with an impassioned lurch, grounded in their singer’s simple, confident affirmation: “I’m right here.” They aren’t going anywhere.", "genre": ["Alternative", "Pop Punk", "power pop"]}

The song becomes a cutting character study of a Van Damme-like shoot-’em-up star who desperately wants to branch out into more serious roles, much to the chagrin of his agent and the family members who fear he’ll lose out on those blockbuster paydays. Lunsford can relate—while he doesn’t share his protagonist’s celebrity profile, he’s no less eager to play against type.

Sure,  has plenty of that signature shimmer, but here, Lunsford and co. aren’t so much keying into a specific ‘60s Rickenbackered sound as tracing the evolution of psychedelia over the ensuing decades. And if the Spacemen 3 gospel-drone of “Come on Now (Give You All My Love)” feels like a natural extension of the band’s established aesthetic, other tracks take bolder leaps outside their comfort zone, whether it’s the synth-swathed chillwave of “Drifting Haze” or the sitar-spiked tabla funk of “Same Old Now” (which strongly suggests Lunsford has spent many a late night zoning out to Primal Scream’s  ). Perhaps no track better illustrates the album’s time-warping ethos than “In This Room,” which effortlessly folds the Eastern mysticism of The Beatles’ “Within You Without You” into the ebullient electro-pop of New Order’s “Temptation.” Coming from a band that could’ve easily satisfied its patiently-waiting cult with another serving of gentle jangle,  reaps the unexpected benefits of thinking outside the box. ", "genre": ["Rock", "jangle pop", "psychedelic rock"]}

Over a gorgeous, piano-driven backdrop, Muse delivers sharp, autobiographical bars: “Me at 16 swearing I’m gonna be a preacher / Me at 21, writing raps and ignoring teachers.” The song culminates in a simple, plaintive mantra declaring “St. Matthew” a song sung “for the love of God.” Muse explores the multi-faceted nature of love throughout  . The project’s first single, “Ain’t No (Philautia),” is an ice-cool, swaggering jam, with Muse flexing and shining brightly over a dark, mournful instrumental.

{"album": "Blood Year", "artist": "Russian Circles", "description": "Writing about instrumental music is a tricky task, as you’re trying to read meaning into songs that are inherently textural. In the absence of lyrics, it’s easy to look to recording details to gain a better understanding of where the musicians were, both physically and mentally, during the creative process. While that’s often foolish, in the case of Russian Circles, those facts mean something. Their new album,   builds a direct link between the band’s past and present.  Recorded with Kurt Ballou, both at his GodCity Studio as well as Chicago’s revered Electrical Audio (where they’ve now recorded four of their seven albums),  reunites the band with the producer who pushed them to new heights on 2016’s  . On songs like “Milano” and “Sinaia,” Ballou understands that guitarist Mike Sullivan’s black metal-styled riffing is not meant to pummel the listener, but is meant as an expression of his own introspection. Where lesser producers would bring Sullivan’s tremolo-picked riffs to the forefront, on   those moments hang back in the mix, showing that as the band move further away from their math rock-indebted beginnings, they’ve found ways to insert their interest in aggressive music without it going into rote or predictable territory. No song on  highlights the fact that Russian Circles have been able to build upon their original ethos as much as “Arluck.” Throughout this moving tribute to Matt Arluck, the Sweet Cobra guitarist who died a decade ago, Sullivan builds some of the poppiest guitar parts he’s ever recorded, the kind that are reminiscent of 2006’s  , or even his old band Dakota/Dakota. But around the midsection, it gives way to a darker, chug-heavy motif, one that the band always reached for, but never made into something as potent as they do here. It speaks to the fact that, after all these years together, Russian Circles are still growing as a band, incorporating new influences into their sound while still honoring the foundation they first set down all those years ago.", "genre": ["Metal"]}

There’s melancholy, too, on “What?!?,” aching synths underlaid with old-school snare hits and a gentle, insistent bassline. But it’s her singing style, again, which really marks her out. On opening track “Let Us Go,” propelled by a taut kick drum, acid bassline, and warm synths, she sings, “Let yourself go / Let us have a good time.” The vocals are high in the mix, and pitched at a lower register than most female dance vocals. It casts the lyrics in an earnest light, conjuring a feeling distinct from other club tracks which express the same sentiments; the tracks’ feel-good calls-to-action sound more muted and less dramatic, but also carry greater weight.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance", "House"]}

Hungary makes an appearance via guitarist Gábor Szabó’s funky Latin fusion “24 Carat.” So does India, with the Sangam Jazz Yatra Sextett, whose Carnatic raga is also surprisingly funky (and operates at a breakneck tempo to boot); Japanese big band Copa Salvo ups the album’s cross-cultural ante with their percolating mambo. U.S. musicians do make a showing: Beaver Harris was a one-time major—now somewhat forgotten—avant-garde drummer from Pittsburgh, whose “Aladdin’s Carpet” numbers among his more accessible pieces. The album’s boldest venture comes from California-based scholar multi-reedist Karlton Hester, listed here as Karl; “Pan African Ballet Music” is 20 minutes of loose, sprawling, semi-free blowing. Bassist Stafford James goes firmly straight ahead with a waltz version of John Coltrane’s “Impressions.” For all its geographic diversity, the compilation is held together by virtue of the deep soul that runs through every performance. In that way, IF Music are the ideal musical archivists: They don’t merely collect musical traditions—they understand them.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

Her spellbinding 2015 debut album  contains entire universes of sound while remaining as intimate as a DMT trip. Immaculate fingerpicked guitar, vast kosmische, noise rock, field recordings, medieval composition, eerie tape tricks, and densely surreal poetry all create threads that Drewchin either ties into impossible knots, or lets loose in disorienting sonic tangles. One of the early breakout releases for Chicago experimental label Hausu Mountain, Eartheater’s debut is now receiving a vinyl reissue that invites new reflection on her holistically expanding sound. For all its otherworldly aura and spacey mysticism,  is grounded on a bedrock of raw talent, virtuosic guitar playing, and a superhuman, eight-octave voice. opens like a Disney film played from a melting VHS tape, with the shimmering, delicately plucked strings of “MacroEV.”  It flows perfectly into “Homonyms,” one of the most bracing displays of Eartheater’s high, creaking singing style. It’s not just Drewchin’s vocal range that’s remarkable, but the   she brings to each verse, transforming herself with every mesmerizing line. On “Put A Head In A Head,” she sings in tense whispers, making the song feel like a particularly unsettling bedtime story, and culminating with a delirious slide-whistle synth solo. “Youniverse” offers a catchy flash of alt-rock before stretching out into a slow-motion sonic blur, then gradually refocusing to become a field recorded rap cypher. For all of the songs’ electro-acoustic twists, it’s Drewchin’s voice that is her most elastic instrument. ’s most abstract moments are also it’s most resonant in hindsight. Weightless, insular soundscapes connect the album’s brightest moments, making them feel like extraterrestrial encounters. “The Internet Is Handmade” is a dark drift of naturalistic occultism in the spirit of both Current 93 and the bad-trip soundscapes of Nurse With Wound. The violin-led “Sigil Life” blooms into the kind of groovy rhythmic number that pointed the way toward last year’s  The all-encompassing wonder contained in Eartheater’s music is best captured in  ’s final two tracks. After following the sprawling trajectory of “Orbit” through over 10 minutes of gauzy, crumbling textures, we return to the ground with “Infinity,” a tender lullaby celebrating imagination and the infinite possibilities that exist beyond the stars. It’s the truest song Drewchin has ever written, a barrier between past and present, ancient and futuristic, inward and outward—all of the things that   takes joy in smashing altogether.

{"album": "Perfumed Earth", "artist": "Purple Pilgrims", "description": "To create their spellbinding sophomore record,  , sisters Valentine and Clementine Nixon retreated to the woods of their native New Zealand. As Purple Pilgrims, the duo craft otherworldly electronic sounds cloaked in magic, mystery, and romance. There’s an earthiness to the group’s soft tendrils of guitar and soft fog of reverb. But while the record’s nine tracks evoke the dreamiest of dreampop, there’s darkness buried just beneath. For much of  Purple Pilgrims abandon not only modern society, but the 21st century altogether, delivering tragic tales of gothic romance with light, ethereal vocals, setting them against delicate arrangements. Think Kate Bush, if she collaborated with Beach House. On “Sensing Me,” they sing of a “high-heeled boy soul steeped in sorrow” who plans a furtive meeting at a cemetery. Death crops up throughout the record—so do sadness, isolation, anxiety, and regret. The sparkling “Two Worlds Apart” is built around the phrase, “I was born to live alone / The only life I’ve ever known.” closes with the lush, haunting “Tragic Gloss,” where the lines between life and death become blurred. Our heroine longs to meet her dearly departed lover where he rests “beneath a stone of grey.” “Never will I find release,” she laments; by the song’s end, she’s met her own harrowing fate. A grim fairy tale rooted firmly in the past,  is an eerily tranquil reminder that some terrors are timeless.", "genre": ["Alternative", "dream pop"]}

As any artist-curator may have experienced first-hand, going through your own body of work with a fine-toothed comb can be a tricky process, since the perspective is often askew. Foote has clearly chosen well. “Brace” is an aquatic fantasy of nervous breaks and fluttering synth pads, like the darting movement of fish and the sudden ripples that causes. The boisterous “Phoenix9V” turns an ambient dream state into a vivid, acidic hallucination. In the midst of this carefully programmed hubbub, there are pensive moments of grace, such as opener “Amethyst,” a track that could have been part of The Next Great American Ambient Album.   closes anxiously with “Bit Rot,” an elegant exercise in contemporary breaks studies, a surprisingly dancefloor-ready mix of structured hardcore and experimental glitch. Foote has a deep understanding of electronic music and the nuances of its vocabulary—all the better to challenge the rules.

{"album": "Grass Stains and Novocaine", "artist": "Seablite", "description": "Shoegaze and twee are the kissing cousins of the indie pop family, not least of all because the addition of fuzz, reverb, delay, and whatever else can be reliably depended upon to add heft and shape to slight songs. Cynicism aside, the results of that pairing can be dazzling when songs take precedent over pedals: atmosphere that sings, riffs that swell and recede, vocals that emanate like a chorus of cherubs hidden in gauzy clouds. That’s the case with  , the debut full-length from San Francisco’s Seablite, which represents a huge step forward for the band. While their self-titled EP was rickety good fun, a bubbly if amateurish pastiche of early ‘80s EPs from the Bangles (for the harmonies) and the Shop Assistants (for the fuzz), the catchy and compact songs on   feel fully formed and newly confident. The overarching influence on Seablite’s sound is unmistakably Lush, drawing heavily on that band’s M.O. of cheerful pop melodies, undulating female harmonies, and lyrics that you can’t really understand, because it’s not about the words so much as the overall mood. Sometimes, the influence is incredibly pointed —“(He’s a) Vacuum Cleaner” could’ve easily have been a   b-side while “Polygraph” reworks gauzy kiss-off “Hypocrite” —but other times the band embraces the jingle-jangle optimism of  -era My Bloody Valentine (try the “Haggard”) and the breathless cuddle punk of Tiger Trap (“Polygraph.”) The album’s centerpiece is “Heart Mountain,” a truly beautiful song that chimes like a clockwork songbird and revolves around a seemingly throwaway chorus about riding “a train to another place,” but takes on devastating new meaning when you realize that it’s about traveling to the Heart Mountain, Wyoming Japanese internment camp.

Lyrics encouraging empowerment are paired with funky, sensual rhythms, and frenetic beats. Opener “Flourish,” which features Angel Bat Dawid, is welcoming and enveloping, carried along by choir-like vocals. On “Against the Wall,” Free asks, “What would you do when your back’s against the wall?” She shifts from confrontation to affirmation on “Movement,” singing, “You’ve got to learn you, deeply / You’ve got to do you, completely.” And “Rushing In” is a song of joy and release, Free proclaiming, “I’m rushing into the sun / I’m rushing into the fun.”  In the Samoan language,   means “in front”; fittingly, composing and producing duo Roderick Jackson and Christopher Kramer, collectively known as Tensei, keep Free’s voice central in the mix and give her ample room to project purpose, confidence, and urgency. “No time to play around,” she sings on “Bold Heart,” a lush, seductive jazz number that could double as the album’s mission statement. “We know how to get lit / That’s not the point right now.” ", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

On her sophomore EP, Friday blends elements of drill, punk, 90s techno, industrial, and more to create songs that pulse with dark power and raw confidence. Album opener “Tear the Veil” sets the tone. A slow-burning number comprised of little beyond booming electronic beats, the song lays out Friday’s mission simply and plainly: “I want it? I get it/ I said, I want it? I get it.” What she wants on   is to explore every style on the darker end of the genre spectrum.“Fatal” is a shadowy dance number about the destructive power of love, with serrated synths that cut across a throbbing, hypnotic beat. “Treason” is overtly industrial—four minutes of electrical crackling behind an ominous bass beat and distant, garbled screams. The tone shifts radically on “Good and Evil,” a pulse-quickening raver that opens with rhythmic beat boxing and gradually gains speed until Friday appears with a scream about one minute in, kicking the song into high gear. It’s tempting to read some of this restlessness in the context of her backstory: Friday emigrated to Montreal from Nigeria as a child, and is now based in Vancouver; it’s possible that being in an “in-between” state is where she’s most comfortable. Another way to look at it, though, is in that opening track: whether it’s rave, drill, industrial, or punk—if Friday wants it, she gets it.", "genre": ["Alternative", "industrial"]}

Their debut LP  t seems optimized for one thing, and one thing alone: making music that’s as foul and disgusting as possible. Cerebral Rot cherry-pick the nastiest bits of doom, sludge, black metal, crust, d-beat, and, first and foremost, old-school death metal. It might be pure, unadorned aestheticism, but you can’t deny their eye for the uniquely revolting. Cerebral Rot’s strength lies not in virtuosic composition or performance, but in unification of approach and hyper-attention to tone. While writing  , they clearly passed on any riff that didn’t sound like it had been fermented in a septic tank. The vocals sound like indigestion. The drums sound soggy, like an attempt at the Blue Man Group’s   thing, except with mud. The guitar solos sound like a host of different things, all of them ugly: they’re chipped drill bits wreaking havoc on human flesh (title track); they’re wire hangers fishing around inside the skull (“Cerebral Rot”); they’re toxic webs shooting out of a radioactive spider (“Primordial Soup Of Radioactive Sewage”). Sometimes, as on the extended “Sardonic Repentance” intro, Cerebral Rot veer into spacey, psychedelic territory, but in this version of space, you can still hear them scream—or, more accurately, squelch.", "genre": ["Metal", "Black Metal", "Death Metal"]}

With layered compositions that take inspiration from the bluffs and ridges of the band’s Oakland home base, Meernaa create an expansive sound grounded in the spaciousness of West Coast scenery.

{"album": "April Is the Cruellest Month", "artist": "Masayuki Takayanagi New Direction Unit", "description": "Masayuki Takayanagi is a legend of Japanese guitar. Beginning as a straight-ahead jazzer in the late 1950s, he eventually turned his attention to destroying those traditions, emerging as a deeply original guitarist on par with Keith Rowe, Derek Bailey, and Jimi Hendrix. His influence can be felt in the music of similar structure-breakers like Keiji Haino, The Boredoms, Jim O’Rourke, and  , to name a few. Takayanagi’s classic  , which has just been reissued by the NY-based label Blank Forms, was originally recorded in 1975 and slated for release on the influential  , but the label imploded before   release. (It was eventually released on CD in Japan in 1991.) The album features one of Takayanagi’s most fearless groups, the New Direction Unit, and the music it contains is unapologetically fierce and monumental. The B-side, “My Friend, Blood Shaking My Heart,” is one long dose of the kind of medicine that might kill you before it makes you better—a screaming, squalling fire storm of sound that races across the earth and lays waste to everything in its path. Which is not to say the album is without moments of beauty; Kengi Mori’s bass clarinet on “What Have We Given?” sits above Nobuyoshi Ino’s bass and the thrashing, trashy cymbals of Hiroshi Yamazaki’s percussion arsenal. On opening track “We Have Existed,” Mori’s flute takes determined leaps over Ino’s brisk cello lines, both of which evolve against and into the smoldering flames of Takayanagi’s guitar. When someone asked Takayanagi about   failure to be released as planned, he replied simply “these things happen.” Forty-four years after it was created,   still sounds fierce and futuristic.

They disappear further into the frost on “Cities of the World,” with the low register of the synths less welcoming and more foreboding. Even with Potts’ dimly lit toms, “Black Vows” feels the most like Clay Rendering of old, with Tara leading on vocals in a dark seance, this time trading trees for concrete towers. It feels endless, like something will arise from the shadows if you keep with the ritual long enough.    isn’t thawed out; it’s the sound of very, very slow melting. The goth-rock core is more exposed, still surrounded by a thick layer of chilly isolationism. There’s darkness all around us, but it makes the world blurry rather than pitch black;   reflects that reality in its combination of the sublime, the rocking, and the terrifying.

Her recorded legacy consists of two late ’60s singles and this self-titled album, produced by Bob Shad for the Mainstream label in 1972. The pensive cover photo is a key to the music contained within: the album has the classic soul sound of Muscle Shoals at times, particularly on the almost Aretha Franklin-esque opening version of Jimmy Webb’s “I Keep it Hid,” but moves into a softer, jazzier realm on tracks like “Looking at Life” and “It Takes Too Long to Learn to Live Alone.” Clark’s vocals can swell like a river threatening to overflow its banks, but more often than not she’s beautifully controlled, flowing along with the serenity of Roberta Flack or Dionne Warwick. The band on   includes session aces like drummer Bernard Purdie and guitarist Cornell Dupree, and Shad’s production is lush without sacrificing visceral impact. Clark, born in Brooklyn, had the restraint of a city girl, rather than the unfettered emotionality of a Southern church-bred singer; there’s something guarded, a you-won’t-hurt-me undertone to her delivery.

Recorded over the span of six days, it finds the Chapel Hill, NC singer/guitarist joining forces with a full-bodied backing band, the Raleigh outfit Drag Sounds. Again, it’s tempting to read something into that fact that she spent six days recording 13 songs; life is so short! So fragile! Live for now, and keep the recording budget under $4,000! Of course, to get caught up in the album’s backstory is to overlook what makes McHenry’s effort so compelling: her simultaneously wounded and defiant songs, and her astoundingly plaintive, classically soulful voice, with its multi-octave range.   took the time it took because it’s a love shack rager, unkempt and swaggering.

This outward-bound aura is apt for a duo formed after a “paranormal experience… of the ghost or alien variety” that occurred when the two toured together with their solo projects (Johnson’s   and Callier’s  ). It sparked a collaboration whose sound is so thoroughly atmospheric, any move they make feels like part of a greater vision.

Featuring Hugo Parent-Potier on trumpet, Charles Miquelon on keys, Phil Legentil on drums, and Tom Tartarin on bass, Schemes is a diverse band with real musical chops who straddle multiple genres comfortably. As for the two complementing vocalists, singer Nadia Baldé has backed Canadian pop star Karl Wolf, Snarky Puppy’s Malika Tirolien, and others, and rapper/producer Mike Clay comes from Montreal’s hip-hop scene as a solo artist. The band display their formidable musical flexibility on tracks like “Hey There Sister Pt. 1” and “Pt. 2,” which run the gamut from earnest neo-soul to a wild  -era Miles Davis free-fusion sound. On “Hello,” the band develop a delicate, laidback groove for Clay to rhyme over about a love lost. Baldé’s chorus is beautiful and sad, full of longing and regret: “I left you on hold, then realized you hung up / Kept waiting about waiting, now time is up / I could’ve said hello, I should’ve said hello.” The album concludes with “Tomorrow,” a catchy, swinging tune that is anchored by a nimble drum and bass groove with tasteful soloing by trumpeter Parent-Potier. It builds in intensity before exploding into a bright, upbeat section that closes out the track—and the EP as a whole. Lasting a short eight bars before fading into silence, this final section feels more present, gritty, and alive than anything else on the record. It’s a slick musical left turn that points to Schemes’ immense promise.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}
{"album": "Death Sequence", "artist": "The Physics House Band", "description": "The new EP by British quartet   lasts less than 17 minutes, but it feels like an eternity—or at the very least, like listening to a bunch of albums at once. Consider the first five minutes of opening track “Death Sequence i.” The band shift from rising prog rock to cinematic guitar meditation, and   from mathed-out metal riffage to nearly symphonic bombast. They pull off these pivots with the muscular prowess and skillful precision of lab-tested scientists. To say they make every second count is an understatement.  But the key to the  ’s success isn’t a matter of instrumental or compositional chops, or even succinctness. Rather, the Physics House Band manage to cram it all into songs that actually  . Even their biggest stylistic jumps feel like logical steps in an ascendant journey, particularly on standouts like “Death Sequence iii”: a dreamscape of starry keyboards meshing around the wry spoken word of comedian/writer Stewart Lee, who has described the group as “a Yes or a Rush, but stripped of any errors of taste and judgment.” Such telekinetic gelling doesn’t mean Physics House Band are afraid to be abrupt, mind you. The EP’s final track, “???,” ends with a hard cut after less than two minutes of grinding, like the cops showed up to the studio and suddenly pulled the plug. And yet, despite these dizzying turns and surprising musical tricks,  never loses its footing. It’s a testament to just how well these four minds sync.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}

Doran’s love of artists like   and   runs so deep, in fact, that Light in the Attic tapped him to curate last year’s  compilation of corporate-sponsored “environmental music” (muzak, essentially) from the ’80s. Meanwhile, Doran and Ryan Carlile have carved out Visible Cloaks’ own corner of the post-everything playground with several   records that acknowledge their predecessors while striving for something new. As Doran said in a  , “We’re students of the history of electronic music, but we’re trying to do more than just create anachronistic recreations of these different things that we appreciate. We’re trying to take those ideas and push them further, with more modern technology and sound design.” The latest step in that evolution couldn’t be more fitting: the aptly named  (translation: serenity), which pairs Visible Cloaks with two pioneers of Japan’s avant-garde scene, pianist Satsuki Shibano and producer Yoshio Ojima. The 15th installment of RVNG’s ongoing   series takes its trans-generational aim to another dimension entirely, collaging the four musicians’ loose ideas together. More than a mere collaboration—the album was created by file-trading between the participants, and one week-long session in Tokyo—the final product features pure “randomized clouds” of sound that are far more active than most ambient efforts these days. This is not a record that recedes into the background; it engulfs the entire room, from the more conventional melodies of “Canzona per sonare no. 4” and “S’Amours ne fait par sa grace adoucir (Ballade 1)” to the elusive vocals, electronics, woodwinds, and waterways of, well, just about everything else.

Whether it’s cryptic prog, murmuring outer space burbles, dancefloor funk, or synth-pop chirpiness, there’s a sense throughout  —initially available last year on cassette, now rereleased with additional tracks and new cover art—that all these derivations and more can be part of one aesthetic.

Her blurred, treated vocals early into the album help to set stages, often with understated slyness (from the title track: “You can’t help yourself / And neither can I, baby”); it feels like listening in on a strangely inviting conversation as it unfolds, in real time. The instrumentals take over as the listen progresses, ranging from the tripped-out “Cosmonaut” with its arrhythmic tones and electronic sighs, to the free-flowing “Feminine Intuition,” feeling sweetly joyful and warm in its rising and falling melodies. When Maret’s singing fully returns on the sprightly “Pink Ray,” it’s almost like the resolution of a narrative, and the album finishes with multilayered efforts like the shimmering and looped pulses of “My Own Pace.” It’s a song title that underscores  ’s communal spirit; with these songs, Maret presents a loving tribute to her community, maintained by a distinct, individual voice that’s impossible to ignore.", "genre": ["Experimental", "experimental pop"]}

Though the band has never shied away from emotional material, Taylor’s candid approach to the lyrics is especially captivating. His bluntness about his father’s passing is piercing: “He was here, and now he’s gone.” While PAWS have dialed-down some of their well-known intensity, songs like the album’s standout track “Honoured To Be Honest” build up to the liveliness of their earlier material.

{"album": "Peace & Harmony", "artist": "Harry Mosco", "description": "After relocating to London in 1973, Nigerian Afro-rock stars   made the decision to obfuscate their mighty Igbo roots and tip the band’s stylistic scales in a more westerly direction. When the group broke up in 1978, co-founder Harry Mosco reoriented himself as a breezy funker-for-all-seasons on hit singles like “Country Boy” (1978) and “Sugar Cane Baby” (1982). In 1979, Mosco released   a sleek sleeper of an album that touches on most of Mosco’s modes and adds a couple of outstanding surprises.   synths—all the rage by ’79—and a sly, muted jazz trumpet embellish “Sexy Dancer,”  ’  slinky and seamless four-to-the-floor opener. And on side two, Mosco delivers a passionately laidback one-two punch with the mellow disco-reggae title track and its intricate and heady version of same, “Peaceful Dub.” Mosco may have been the album’s writer, arranger, and producer, but some of the credit for its more inventive moments, especially that terrific dub track, is owed to engineer Mark Lusardi, who’d been working with London alt-reggae-rock troublemakers like Public Image Ltd., Jah Wobble, and Dennis “Blackbird” Bovell. “I got reggae in my eyes, rock ‘n’ roll on my lips,” sings Mosco on  s closing boogie, “Do It Together.” Having opted for the disco imperative, The Funkees were no more; Mosco himself released only two more albums and would die penniless in 2012. “But I still can’t get no satisfaction,” he continues, “’cause Afro is the main thing.”", "genre": ["World", "jazz-funk"]}
{"album": "Useless Coordinates", "artist": "Drahla", "description": "On their debut full-length   London-via-Leeds trio Drahla take post-punk’s characteristic noisiness and find a way to make it even harsher. The strained drum roll that opens the album serves as a terse processional. The songs that follow—the bellicose call-to-arms “Gilded Cloud” and “Serenity,” both of which are pierced by screeching electric guitars and dissonant bass—make good on that stentorian opening. Drahla have plenty they want to champion on  , beginning with their own growth. “I will make no apology for slipping into serenity,” says singer-guitarist Luciel Brown. Later, she turns that phrase into an order, shouting it as if she’s standing in front of a mirror, demanding she cut herself some slack. Elsewhere, the trio try out krautrock-inspired crescendos and cacophonous experimentation. Brown’s vocal and guitar work recall the wiry punch of Priests, Mike Ainsley drums as if dicing the uptempo art-punk of Shopping, and Rob Riggs coaxes a guttural tone from his bass that calls to mind prime Jesus Lizard. Their combined efforts result in tracks like “Stimulus for Living” and “Twelve Divisions of the Day” where, instead of simply hurling themselves against a quickening tempo as their instruments buck heads, they repeatedly change directions, leaving room for undirected solos or big blocks of silence. Their best moments make use of a squealing saxophone, courtesy of Christopher Duffin. “React/Revolt” begins like simmering improvisational jazz, all hushed bass and exhausted cymbals. Halfway through, the band reveal what they’ve been hiding: ample energy, colossal cheers, and braided guitar lines.

On   he harnesses a live band sound and tackles multiple roles himself, handling synths, programming, and “live remixing.” While   is a commanding statement on its own, there’s a strong sense of continuity with volume one. “O-Edo Nihonbashi,” a reimagined Japanese folk song, is a parallel of sorts to “Akatombo” from  , with alto saxophonist Josh Johnson making the first of several compelling melodic contributions on flute, a sound that instantly heightens the song’s mystical mood. “Bushidō II” has a more agitated electronic feel than the earlier “Bushidō 1,” while “Mizugaki (reprise)” briefly sets the tune’s main melody in calmer waters, with a floating tempo but no drum beat. On “Ryūgū-jō,” de Clive-Lowe brings violinist Tylana Enomoto on board, varying the sound more still; with “Shitennō” he toggles between a stark Eastern melody and a beautiful chord cycle reminiscent of neo-soul, turning Johnson loose on alto.

{"album": "To Believe", "artist": "The Cinematic Orchestra", "description": "  The Cinematic Orchestra likes to take its time. Led by founder Jason Swinscoe and longtime collaborator Dominic Smith, the London outfit’s catalog stands at just four studio albums in 20 years, with   their first in 12. Their discography is rounded out by a pair of far-flung soundtracks, one for Dziga Vertov’s 1929 silent masterwork  and, in 2008, another for the Walt Disney documentary  . Those detours make sense for the duo—the three studio albums surrounding the scores are equally full of plush movie jazz. The studio albums’ best moments still astonish—the way the opening stalker’s bass line that kicks off “Durian” on their 1999 debut is cut just short with an abrupt hard edit before it loops back around; or the billowing arrangement that fans out from the center of the ten-minute “Burn Out,” from 2002’s  . Far from settling into a well-heeled rut, the best moments on  are even more opulent than the Cinematic Orchestra’s earlier work. Built, vaguely, around the titular theme (belief, that is), the album has its ponderous moments, but the group makes them work in context. Roots Manuva intoning strenuously on “A Caged Bird/Imitations of Life” by itself would be an iffy proposition. But here, with the strings like sunlight glinting through the window at sunset? Yes, please. It’s rare when an album peaks with its two longest tracks, but that’s the case with  . The instrumental “Lessons,” placed in the album’s middle, follows a circular, eight-bar tune with orchestration that stretches out like an endless horizon for nine lustrous minutes. The 11-minute finale, “A Promise,” sung by Heidi Vogel, is so full of aural smoke it probably violates fire department codes. Violins billow as Vogel tremulously hits arcing falsetto notes; the key change around the four-minute mark is as shamelessly thrilling as a vintage Spielberg gotcha. And when a rhythm section finally breaks into things a good while later, the track’s hurtling momentum is all the Cinematic Orchestra’s—like a dare to the auteur who could match it.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Bahir", "artist": "Dexter Story", "description": "During the first minute of  the new album from multi-instrumentalist and producer  , a steady beating drum crescendo slowly evolves into an intricate composition: traditional jazz pianos, classical strings, wind chimes and East African percussion playfully mingle with cymbals that almost sound like a rushing wind. The opening track, “Techawit,” feels like an introduction to Dexter Story’s brand new world — a place where the musician can toe the line between different dimensions, embracing the pull of history and tradition, while conjuring a new, seamless fusion between the old and the new.  This fusion forms the backbone of  an album which finds the Los Angeles-based artist absorbing the sounds acquired during his travels through East Africa, and then distilling them into his brand of refined folk and global rhythms. Across these songs, Ethiopian jazz, African psychedelic rock and funk, Sudanese dance rhythms, and Tuaregi grooves mingle with the jazz and folk traditions of the Americas. Perhaps that’s why the music Dexter Story has composed for  feels celebratory: a meticulously crafted and beautiful record that rests on the art of collaboration. Tracks like “Bila” (featuring the Ethiopian multi-instrumentalist  ), and “Gold” (with a stellar vocal turn from  ) sound larger than life: vibrant patchworks of Ethiopian soul, North Sudanese shaygiya dance rhythms, and funk, embroidered with contemporary soul and experimental jazz. These songs give way to a dub-influenced, piano-driven collaboration with  , a vocalist with a unique voice that mirrors North African singing techniques; and a spirited psychedelic jam, “Mamdoo.” There are moments of introspection, as well, such as the atmospheric title track, featuring Ethiopian electronic musician Endeguena Mulu (aka  ). As the album comes to an end, Dexter Story reminds us that   is not only meant to represent the union of two worlds that are an ocean apart.

{"album": "Softer Faces", "artist": "Living Hour", "description": "Some dream pop invites escapism—prizing texture over melody, mood over message: after all, that’s kind of the nature of dreams, isn’t it? Winnipeg’s Living Hour have clearly mastered the auditory qualities of the genre, but use them to foreground honesty and vulnerability, rather than languid romanticism. Their second album,  , then, represents a hyper-present vision of dream pop.  A bittersweet twinkle of guitar interplay highlights lead single “Bottom Step”; lead singer Sam Sarty laments the “highs and lows of the hellos I’ll never know,” describing a missed connection with soft, poetic clarity. The rest of  is similarly defined by a longing for romance, but also an unwillingness to suspend realism. “There’s no symmetry / Left between / You and me,” Sarty admits on “Water,” her voice undulating with the pulse of Gil Carroll and Adam Soloway’s ever-interlocked guitars. “I Sink I Sink,” driven by vocal rounds between Sarty, Soloway, and bassist Brett Ticzon, even skews a bit meta, considering Living Hour’s blend of fantasy sonics and clear-eyed commentary: “Stand still with me like they do on TV / What do you think of reality?” The band’s assisted by veteran producer Kurt Feldman (The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Chairlift, No Joy, DIIV), who ensures that each and every guitar and keyboard tone on  sparkles and breathes with warmth. But just like the album’s lyrical content, Living Hour’s instrumental choices are what really keeps their music free of clichés. Horns, played by Sarty and drummer Alex Chochinov, add a Sufjan Stevens-style brightness to most tracks, counteracting the gauziness but not entirely cancelling it out. Other left turns, like tricky grooves (“Before You Leave”), Talk Talk-esque ambience (“Most”), and a surprisingly doomy centerpiece (“No Past”) make  a dynamic listen that nevertheless retains a consistent feel. Living Hour’s alterations of genre tropes are unorthodox but unassuming; the buoyant horns fit comfortably within the sound.

The album is broken up by snippets of phone conversations about the breakup, using the spoken words to outline the emotional effect while the songs expound on the broader themes. Musically,   traverses a wide range of styles: “Vent of Love” employs 808 kicks and the clear influence of trap music, while “I Want You Again,” with is falsetto vocal line and twinkling piano, recalls the heyday of Motown. “Wounded Hearts Club,” with its stuttering rhythms, popping bass and blinking electronics, feels like a distant cousin to ‘80s electro-funk, while the luxurious “Revisions” draws on the sound of ‘90s neo-soul.  ’s wide stylistic range mirrors the turbulence in the aftermath of a breakup—crushing lows followed by euphoric highs.

Like Lemmy, bassist and vocalist Jason Netherton is Misery Index’s only original member, and with him at the helm you know what to expect: equal concern for Brutal Truth and brutal truths.  That isn’t to say they put out the same record twice: 18 years in, their sixth record   develops their sound while tightening up their approach. Misery Index feel crisper, their death metal side more polished, still without excess, and their grind side more precise.   doesn’t flip their influences, but it does put them in a different, slightly brighter light. Pretty much every deathgrind band is indebted to Carcass to some degree, though   veers towards  ’s precision more than  ’s ramshackle gore. “Hammering the Nails” is a grindier version of modern-day Carcass: sleek, and able to cut you in a flash. Netherton played in Dying Fetus before forming Misery Index, and there’s still a touch of ignorant brutality left in “Decline and Fall” and “I Disavow” in their ending breakdowns. No use wasting a killer slam riff if you’ve got one at your disposal. There’s always been an anti-establishment streak to Misery Index’s music—ghoulish figures dressed as priests and businessmen are pretty much their Baphomet and inverted crosses—and   keeps that up. “The Choir Invisible” stands out for being unusually anthemic: Netherton, with old-fashioned gusto and the help of hardcore-tinged gang vocals, turns “We are disposable! The choir invisible!” into not just a chorus, but a rallying cry. It’s the most distinguishable vocal of the record, one that’s on the same level as the rest of the music, pressing itself to the front. There’s rarely a slow moment on  , yet nothing quite as urgent as “Choir.” Sure, we’re all fucked, but Misery Index see that sentiment as a small form of uniting comfort.", "genre": ["Metal", "Death Metal"]}

Whereas their peers galvanize the subgenre’s requisite anguish into big-tent brutalism ( ), turgid grunge-gaze (Pianos Become the Teeth), and wide-eyed alternative rock (mewithoutYou), the Michigan band play what is essentially the emo equivalent of spoken word—slam poetry at its most sullen. Listening to frontman Jordan Dreyer’s tense, eloquent monologues on 2008’s  , with their tight prose and copious references to Japanese folklore, Edgar Allen Poe, and Kurt Vonnegut, one might swear they’d stumbled in on a depressive creative writing workshop. Despite this literary bent, La Dispute never force sentiment in their stories; they simply lay out the scenery, leaving us to read between the lines.  The band’s Epitaph debut,  , is a little bit of a paradox—a carefully-measured reflection on cheery topics like time, memory, death, and grief, which just so happens to feature their dreamiest material to date. Thematic and textural contrasts feature heavily across these tracks; take the two-part “Fulton Street,” which finds Dreyer describing grim roadside discoveries (hell, the very first words we hear on the album are “Found a body at the rest stop”) as sparse, faintly-strummed chords flutter in the margins.

Throughout the EP, Oscar Jerome’s graceful guitar leads serve as a complement to Sheila Maurice-Grey’s triumphant horn charts, and the songs swing between slow grooves (“Ti-de”) and steady rhythmic shuffle (“Uman”). Cassie Kinoshi and Richie   take a minimalist approach to vocals, using them mostly to punch up particularly simmering sections of songs like “Uman” and “Abusey Junction.” The band’s music is equally suited to an outdoor party on a late summer’s evening, or the inside of a darkened late-night jazz club; the slow crawl of guitar and steady, percolating rhythms gentle beckon two-steppers to the dancefloor, subtly nodding to the jazz and Afrobeat of the past while keeping its eyes fixed on the present.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

This compilation, which serves as a kind of restatement of purpose, features two songs each from a number of the label’s notable alumni (including Cheer-Accident and The Flying Luttenbachers), alongside tracks by newer, like-minded bands. The Flying Luttenbachers re-record one older song (“Demonic Velocities”) and deliver one all-new one (“Prelude To Mutation”); Cheer-Accident offer a King Crimson-gone-funk tune (“War Is A Warrior”) and a dreamy ballad (“Site”); and Cellular Chaos deliver two shrill, caterwauling pieces that keep the rock in noise-rock. One group making its debut here, before releasing a full-length album at month’s end, is Skryptor, the kinda-sorta all-star trio of former Dazzling Killmen guitarist Tim Garrigan, former Craw bassist David McClelland, and STATS drummer Hank Shteamer (also a highly respected music journalist/critic). Their music is crushingly heavy, meant to be played as loud as possible; “Red Mountain” is pure arena-rock shred madness, with massive, Steve Albini-sized drums (actual engineering and mixing:  ). The sequencing works very well, as immediately palatable acts are followed by noisier and more aggressive ones and vice versa.

{"album": "Past Lives", "artist": "Caleb Burhans", "description": "New York composer and multi-instrumentalist Caleb Burhans is a man of contrasts. He’s a self-described agnostic with a passion for sacred music (he has a history of singing in church choirs). He’s a composer who creates noncommercial music for his own projects, but has worked with popular comics of late-night TV (including Stephen Colbert and David Letterman). And, as a musician, he’s been known to adapt his talents for any style, performing in orchestras, ambient ensembles, rock bands, and disco groups, among other settings. All of those experiences (sans disco, perhaps) come into play on Burhans’s latest album,  , a collection of four pieces from his decades-spanning catalog of works thematically centered around grief—not just as a response to death or failed relationships, but also to time, opportunity lost to addiction, and changing eras and identities (he wrote 2010’s “Requiem for General Motors in Janesville, Wisconsin” after the auto plant in his hometown ceased production). But where his 2013 album   mixes reverent choral vocals with lush orchestral arrangements,   is characterized by sparse, profoundly intimate instrumentals that feel more like a private mediation than communal ritual. Co-produced with Grey Mcmurray, Burhans’s collaborator in electro-acoustic duo itsnotyouitsme, the record does a lot within that context. Opener “A Moment for Jason Molina”—a tribute to the indie songwriter who passed away in 2013—features Simon Jermyn on guitar and recalls some of the earthy, soul-stirring qualities of Molina’s music. “Contritus,” performed by New York’s JACK Quartet, channels a contemplative, cinematic rollercoaster of emotions. After a gentle marimba and harp performance on “Once in a Blue Moon,” Burhans closes things out with “Early Music (for a Saturday),” merging stoic bass guitar and minimalist electronic blips into an interplanetary journey that slowly dissolves into the white light of the beyond. In many faiths and traditions, mourning is viewed as an act for the living. Likewise,   doesn’t just seek to honor departed friends or note a closing chapter of life, but to explore the unanswered questions and complex feelings of the bereaved. Though the moods might be sad, Burhans always provides plenty of space for reflection. And in times where personal tragedies often play out more publicly on a more massive scale than ever, this album feels like a gift.", "genre": ["Experimental", "guitar"]}
{"album": "Sewele", "artist": "Sir Shina Peters", "description": "  In 1989, Shina Peters released    , an album that would propel his musical career to new heights and result in him being crowned the father and king of Afro-juju music—a previously unheard medley of juju rhythms and Afrobeat. His style, which mixed fast, unrelenting  style percussion with electric guitars and futuristic keys made him an international superstar.  But Peters had been playing music long before that LP: a self-taught musician, he was a guitar player, pianist, and vocalist in some of Lagos’s hottest bands throughout the 1970s and 1980s. , his 1986 album, marked a crucial change of direction for him: he was just starting out as a solo artist, experimenting with his sound, and trying to make his mark in the world of juju music.  The record wasn’t a commercial success, and is often forgotten in discussions of Peters’ career. But it was an important time in the evolution of his sound. Thankfully,  ’s reissue unearths  ’s four extended jams: the title track runs to over 13 minutes long, but doesn’t overstay its welcome, bursting with syncopated percussion and Peters’ twangy guitar riffs. “Yabis” is a funky Afrobeat number with an irresistibly catchy hook, over which Peters exhorts his people to be proud of who they are. In “Agbe’ere De,” another pleasantly long track, Peters and his International Stars Band sneak in the familiar riffs of “Get up Stand Up” by Bob Marley and ABBA’s “I Have a Dream,” before ending with “Late Aboderin,” where smooth percussion underpins a catchy guitar riff and Peters’ languorous vocals. With its original artwork and extensive liner notes written by the man himself, Strut brings to life a long lost chapter of Sir Shina Peters’ musical career, and acts as a reminder of his invaluable contribution to Nigerian music.", "genre": ["World"]}
{"album": "Peru’s Master Percussionist", "artist": "Chocolate", "description": "Learning that an artist named Chocolate recorded music in Las Vegas back in 1990, one would assume the recordings contained big-band swing, cosmic funk, or some other style that would play well in classic downtown Vegas. But this musical odyssey to Sin City was made by Julio “Chocolate” Algendones, the brilliant percussionist and star of Afro-Peruvian music, who passed away in 2004. Mostly recorded during a trip to the U.S. with his group Perujazz, Algendones’s   connects festejo rhythms—a festive form of Afro-Peruvian music—with the traditional Yoruba sounds of Western Africa and spiritual patterns of the Santeria religion.  The arrangements are minimalist to the point of being austere as Algendones uses only a few time-honored percussion instruments—congas, kalimbas, seeds, and cajón—to build his textured orchestration. This unfurnished approach might take time for newcomers to fully appreciate, but the rhythmic play on the 14-minute “Conga Forte, Rico Cajón” rewards patience. You can feel Chocolate’s hands rap the rawhide skin as this soothing piece evokes imaginary ritual ceremonies. Closer “Un Tych” invites cameos from Perujazz members Manongo Mujica (drums, bowed cymbal), David Pinto (bass), and Jean Pierre Magnet (saxophone)—Magnet’s sax appears over the last few seconds of the track, putting a dramatic closure to the record. But this is Chocolate’s world.  , now reissued by Buh Records, is an expert concoction of indigenous beats and patterns that encapsulates its creator’s dedication to his form.", "genre": ["World"]}

The album’s 11 songs are heavily percussive, built from live instrumentation as well as electronic sounds and turntables. “Talang” works an idiosyncratic groove, with clipped vocal samples, video-gamey synths, and echoing drum patterns that alternate between layered, frenetic, and measured. The driving “Cave Rain Drumming in My Ear” builds its hyperactive rhythm from digital drums and pinprick vocal samples. And on the title track, the duo seems to be creating a drum circle for the digital age, opening with a ricocheting rhythm and gradually layering in synths and digital effects.   works because of the seamless synergy between Valjean and Momin.

They’d probably laugh at being a called a supergroup, though, so consider them more of a stupor-group, since their gravity-laden noise rock lumbers and staggers like an elephant on a bender. With punishing rhythms and scorched-earth distortion, USA/Mexico bask in the primitive beauty of dense sludge. They weren’t lying when they gave one song on their 2017 debut album   the name “Dumber Rock Riff.”   USA/Mexico’s second album,  , plays out even heavier and woozier than its predecessor. Most of the songs stomp slowly under the spell of Coffey’s bombed-out beats, drenching them in static and slobber. It’s monolithic without being monotone: dirty sounds and gritty textures sliding over each other like sandpaper wiped across a chalkboard. On “Eric Carr T-Shirt,” the plodding pace nearly collapses, while on a cover of Cherubs’ “Shoofly”—boosted by guest Kevin Whitley, Cherubs’ guitarist/volcalist—the band stretches and strains as if pumping iron in a vat of molasses. It’s not all one-speed lurch, though: the hectic “Vaporwave Headache” actually flies by, while 17-minute closer “Anxious Whitey” cycles through a veritable opera of pressurized gunk. Consider the latter USA/Mexico’s version of “Stairway to Heaven,” if that stairway was covered with mud—and led somewhere much more interesting than nirvana.", "genre": ["Punk"]}
{"album": "Earth Night", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "  Clocking in at a staggering 57 tracks and over five hours in runtime, the compilation   essentially serves two functions. Aesthetically, it provides a snapshot of the international dance music scene; with this many songs, it’s tough to zero in on a single throughline, but the vast majority of the artists here incorporate traditional musics into their pulsing, rippling songs. But there’s a more practical function, too. The album serves as an appetite-whetter for the second annual   event on April 19, during which parties will be held in nine major cities, with the proceeds from those events going to benefit organizations like   and  . (Proceeds from the compilation benefit those same groups.) There’s a reason to be wary of compilations that run this long—too many of them succumb to a kind of “table scraps” mentality where the nobility of the cause is allowed to outshine the caliber of the music. Fortunately, everyone involved in   brought their A-Game. To try to round up highlights would require more space than we have here, but there are a few that leap out: “Rundfunk” by Curses tugs a razor-edged surf guitar across a bed of throbbing bass; Chancha Via Circuito continues to prove himself one of the most inventive digital cumbia producers working today—his contribution “Nagual” wrings maximum tension from an ominous low-end rhythm, dusting it sparingly with mournful flutes. The delightfully inscrutable Dengue Dengue Dengue pushes far into the avant-garde, constructing “Ringding” from a wobbly, off-kilter rhythm, a synth line that borders on darkwave, and a haunting griot-like vocal melody. Stefano Ritteri’s “Dope Mani” seems lit up in neon, a euphoric vocal sample spliced and looped over a walloping club beat; and Little Boots teams with Cyril Hahn for one of the comps most straightforward songs, a bit of airy R&B full of flutters and sighs. Not only does the caliber of the music justify  ’s formidable running time, but the intention behind the compilation ensures those efforts are in the service of noble ends.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"]}
{"album": "The Onrush Of Eternity", "artist": "log(m) & Laraaji", "description": "Laraaji is best known as one of ambient music’s great masters, but he’s no stranger to the world of dub. His mastery of instruments, from mbira and zither, melded perfectly with the Japanese dub group Audio Active on 1994’s collaborative LP   a strong record that also revealed Laraaji’s surprising talent as an MC. That year also marked the debut effort from log(m), or Legion Of Green Men, the long-running dub and IDM duo of brothers Lex and Rew MacCrimmon. The two projects have traveled on their respective orbits ever since, but have now aligned for  , an epic collection condensing a decade of studio jams into three airily elastic LPs.  Laraaji’s best work in recent memory have often spoken to his collaborative spirit. Last year’s full-length  , with synth trio  , was a high point, and his frequent work with partner Arji OceAnanda has shone both when it comes to music and their laughter therapy workshops. On  , his classic instrumentation melts into log(m)’s spaciest indulgences; many of the best tracks, such as opener “Daisy Fields” and “Sruthi Box Resonance,” are mirrored by dub versions (“Daisy Dub” and “Sruthi Dub Resonance”). Throughout the album’s massive 90-minute-plus runtime, the more untethered dub versions play first, allowing the album to steadily expand, contract, and repeat in focused, breathlike bursts. (To that reminiscent, respiratory end, Laraaji’s iconic laughter drives the LP’s standout track “Sunken Forest,” its sharpened vocalization samples cutting through dense riddim webs with ease.) Though   offers a supremely chill experience regardless of format, it’s arguably at its best when experienced as a sustained work: all six sides of its physical three-LP format play en suite, ad infinitum. This mode of listening showcases one of log(m)’s calling cards, the “eternal opuscules”: locked, eternally-looping grooves the duo have tucked into releases since their earliest 12”s. On vinyl, each side ends with errant fragments that completely eliminate the automatic reset of the needle—a framing that casts  as a potentially-endless bout of escapism, rather than a mere assemblage of tracks.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dub"]}

The cello functions as both melody and harmony, the two often converging. The tension between these two lines builds and releases, becoming all the more powerful for its subtle evolution. Her music sometimes seems repetitive, in a hypnotic way, but close listening reveals steady movement. Kent’s use of electronic instruments feels lighter than in the past. In “Floating City,” the synthesizers and cello each occupy their own sonic space, even when layered atop one another. On the closing track “Crepuscolo,” a quiet piano melody is buried in layers of cello and gentle distortion, fueling an undercurrent of contemplative unease. There’s a subtlety and sparseness to the way Kent marries synthesizers and strings on this record.

{"album": "Eternal Words", "artist": "Tomas Nordmark", "description": "Tomas Nordmark’s immersive electronic sculptures feel like time-lapse photos of technological decay. Throughout   Nordmark employs the phase shifting principle first pioneered by Steve Reich in his tape loop experiments in the ‘60s. Reich was invested in process music, where the listener should be alert to gradual changes, and across  , Nordmark uses slow harmonic changes to create a bigger, busier picture. There’s a lot to chew on: Layers and layers of bleeps, drift, and drone bring to mind  . Nordmark creates his own sonic language that relies heavily on textures, from the lacerating noise of “Words” to the jittery ambience of “Days” and “Speaking,” a blissful trip anchored by a bone-rattling celestial drone. But for all of Nordmark’s canny synthetic world-building,   has a human core; the album was inspired by Mark Fisher’s   and is partly based on ancient Scandinavian music and sacred hymns. “Human” marries frenzied pizzicato with a far-off bass drum, “Eternal” sounds like a scrambled conversation between two AIs, while “Future” warns of a portentous force spinning out of control. The Swedish-born, London-based Nordmark studied Audio Culture and Contemporary Art in Sweden, and throughout  , his multi-dimensional songs are refracted through an aesthete’s lens. The fact that the album was produced by a single digital synth and sound processor celebrates electronic music’s potential to use just a handful of elements to create dense, thought-provoking art.", "genre": ["Electronic", "atmospheric"]}
{"album": "Isa", "artist": "Croatian Amor", "description": "On  , Croatian Amor’s Loke Rahbek makes his own chimeric mythology, nodding to historic religious figures and events—the title is a Muslim Arabic translation of “Jesus”—while acknowledging the terrifying power of government and military technology. Rahbek enlists vocal contributions from Alto Aria, Soho Rezanejad, HTRK’s Jonnine Standish, Yves Tumor, and Frederikke Hoffmeier (Puce Mary), perhaps an allusion to a central theme in the record—hope in human connection.  The electronic orchestration on   is lush and evocative, waxing both organic and synthetic, delivering clear sonic representation of the themes of technology and humanity. Within seconds of opening song “Towards Isa,” an angelic choir takes center stage; then, the modified synths come in, oscillating between the infantile and the cybernetic, their patterns punctuated by skittering crashes and deep breaths. The song ends with the repeated incantation “All angels meet again”—a transcendent promise of connection. For all its beauty,  is ultimately a record shaded by the looming presence of military technology in our world. An “entirely black airplane” doubles as a guiding symbol for “Eden 1.1” and “Eden 1.2,” two delicate tracks featuring vocals by Hoffmeier and Yves Tumor, respectively, that allude to the dehumanization and fear that surveillance technology can inspire. Even those moments of darkness are pursuant to Rahbek’s faith in kinship, though. As   fades out with its final track “In World Cell,” a sublime track filled with sensual synths and soulful vocals, it’s apparent that even though Rahbek is wielding electronic instruments, his plea is to other humans. “Do you feel the way that I do?” the song asks before fading out, a call to consider others’ perspectives and emotions.

It’s to Blakrok’s credit, then,  , her first full-length project since 2013’s  , sounds like it was recorded entirely on her own creative terms. It’s a 12-track record that whisks the listener away to a beguiling science fiction world of Blakrok’s own conjuring, where astrological and futuristic references mix with naturalistic and mystical imagery to create an album that positively hums with otherworldly atmosphere.  This vivid worldbuilding begins with producer  ‘s transcendental beats. Keeping in line with previous sci-fi rap projects like   and  ‘s misadventures as Dr. Octagon, the production combines gritty drums that sound like they’re sampled from a dusty ’60s funk 45 with eerie synths and woozy ambient spot effects. (Appropriately, Keith cameos on “Mars Attacks.”) Against this intoxicating backdrop, Blakrok traverses a realm of twisted organic matter where hip-hop’s standard sucker MCs have been replaced by mythological characters. On “Picture Box,” she goes from communicating with Aries through her pineal gland, to threatening she’ll “trigger moonquakes” cast from her spellbook. Next, she’s “chasing phantasms” and rescuing sacred stone tablets over the hazy drums and moody bass twangs of “Monatomic Mushroom.” Like all good sci-fi experiences, there’s a dystopian murmur throughout  ; it comes to a climax on the poignant, static-crusted closing cut, “Land of Gray,” where our hero gazes out over scorched lands, raises her scepter, and sagely rues how “man’s awakening is accompanied by grief.” As the song fades into fuzz and reverb, you’ve witnessed the confirmation of a truly individual new rap voice.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}
{"album": "Ripe for Anarchy", "artist": "Business of Dreams", "description": "  Corey Cunningham a pop nostalgist. His 2010s band Magic Bullets mined both the frenetic jangle of Postcard Records and the wistful melancholy of The Smiths; Terry Malts—whose   was one of our  —frames the rococo stateliness of ‘80s New Romantic music with punk rock’s barbed wire. And with the now two-albums-deep project Business of Dreams (who   made a  ), he explores the moment in UK history when the late-stages of Sarah Records’ cotton-candy indie pop was beginning to give way to the early days of Britpop. Usually, when an artist works from such towering reference points, the music that results has the tendency to feel washed out or derivative, but Cunningham is such an adroit pop scholar—and natural hook writer—that he makes everything feel as if you’re hearing it for the first time. There’s not necessarily anything novel about, say, the big, blurry acoustic guitars and off-in-the-distance vocals that make up  ’s impossibly gorgeous title track, but there doesn’t have to be; Cunningham delivers the song with such effortlessness, and the chorus goes airborne so beautifully, that it’s impossible not to surrender to its charms. It helps that Cunningham’s obsession with pop bleeds into the album’s lyrics, allowing it to act as both container and contents. In the gently-galloping “My Old Town,” he sings about, “The long walk home/ singing songs of the bands you download”; on “I Feel Dread,” which juxtaposes a big, Byrds-ian guitar arpeggio against delay-soaked rhythm guitar, he seeks respite from life’s darkness the only way he knows how: “Headphones on and I’m singing along to Saint Julian,” admitting, “music’s all I’ve got.” And early in the record, after a calliope-like organ line that would do The Clean proud, he sings, “Negativity rules everything around me”; the song, naturally, is named “N.R.E.A.M.” Thematically, the album deals with the idea of release—a necessary next step after the topics that informed the previous Business of Dreams record: the passing of Cunningham’s father and the hiatus from Terry Malts and Magic Bullets that followed. In that light, Cunningham’s obsession with music takes on an almost spiritual component: it’s not just an idle hobby, it’s the silver key that opens the door to freedom and happiness. On  , Cunningham finds his way to that freedom—sometimes slowly, sometimes painfully— in every sun-dappled song.

{"album": "The Language of Injury", "artist": "Ithaca", "description": "“Affection is just an affectation.” Consider the above aphorism, bestowed upon us by Ithaca’s lead vocalist Djamila Azzouz in the closing peals of “Impulse Crush,” a thesis of sorts for  , the hardcore upstarts’ bruising, beguiling debut LP. Yes, the London band makes overture after sweeping romantic overture throughout these ten tracks, crossing-up mosh-ready fare with melancholic ambient passages, weeping guitars, and virtuosic vocal harmonies; their lyrics predominantly center around uplifting themes of love, acceptance, and resilience. Only by diving deep into the  , with all its overhanging dread and violent twists and turns, do we discover the true praxis driving Ithaca’s bleeding-heart aesthetic: a commitment to radical emotional honesty and self-sufficiency, rather than the misguided, if well-intentioned, “radical softness” du jour.  Which brings us to the five-piece’s main conceit on this LP: offering blissful, shoegaze-y respite from the din — that sweet, familiar swoon, again and again — only to drop us back into hell a few agonizing moments later. Though Ithaca reprise this pattern several times over the course of the record, their game-plan rarely scans as predictable, thanks to the winding, amorphous arrangements in which they’re situated; “CLSR” and “Slow Negative Order” channel blackened, proggy post-metal à la Deafheaven and the Ocean, and grunge rears its heavy-leaded head on phenomenal closer “Glint.” The end result is a gorgeous, gargantuan record that flips hardcore sentimentalism on its head — not for the sake of novelty, but of necessity.", "genre": ["Punk"]}
{"album": "Living Tomb", "artist": "Ossuarium", "description": "When one thinks of death metal, one doesn’t think free vibes and eternal sunshine psychedelia, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be trippy. “Corrosive Hallucinations,” the fourth track from Portland quartet Ossuarium’s debut record  , affirms both the subgenre’s pummeling nature, and its potential for conjuring acid-drenched terror. “Hallucinations” violently seesaws throughout, unloading a flurry of guitar slashes in the time it takes to sputter out a single breath; if that wasn’t weird enough, there’s a dying synth squall midway, as if the embers of sci-fi prog-death outfit  ’ exploded spaceship were drifting back into the atmosphere.  Ossuarium does this, mind you, all while twisting a rusted death-doom blade in Disincarnate’s style of mind-searingly-fluid death metal. “Writhing in Emptiness” moves almost seamlessly from rotten Autopsy-style filth to placid dream sequences only to end up back in beatdown realms. The end results recall the work of Australian death-doom pioneers   if they had a thing for paisley. With Ossarium forgoing most semblances of flash entirely, their softer breaks assume a deep, hypnotic character. Closer “End of Life Dreams and Visions Pt.2” spaces out into several moments of bliss, before a doomy riff storms in to kill it back to life. “Vomiting Black Death” begins with flanged pick scrapes and piano lines that would sound deafening were they not so submerged in the mix; they’re subtle enough to unnerve without overtaking the song’s structure. Ossuarium delicately appeal to metal fandom’s many, often-warring factions with their kaleidoscopic, far-out approach: hard-headedness for the OSDM diehards, a little bit of oddity for the proggy   set, and just enough murk to get Incantation devotees drooling (consider “Malicious Equivalence,” a hulking highlight that captures Ossarium at their most dissonant and doomy).

Longtime fans may trace its minimal tracks—many of which feature nothing but a basic guitar progression and gaunt electronic grooves—back to Panda Bear’s first widely available LP, 2004’s  . In spirit, at least. A healing set of hymnals for Lennox’s father, who was facing the final stages of terminal cancer at the time,   actually has more in common with the abstract folk cuts of Animal Collective ( , especially) than Panda Bear’s new palette. Beginning with the splish-splash overtones of “Dolphin,”  takes the spacious production techniques of trap and dub in entirely new directions. You’ll need a decent set of speakers or headphones to appreciate its life aquatic loops, but the main takeaway is music that’s deceptively simple. So while you may find yourself humming alongside the Auto-Tuned hooks of spare numbers like “Master,” “Cranked,” and “Token,” nothing on here reaches for the rafters like Panda Bear’s last full-length did (see: the pure bombast of “Mr Noah” and echo chamber expressionism of “Boys Latin”). Instead,  gets under your skin, tackling human desire and today’s omnipresent technology head-on. It’s hard to think of a Panda Bear song as unsettling as “Inner Monologue,” for instance. Centered around the string-padded cries (or is it moans?) of someone who’s clearly distraught, it features robotic, free-associative rhymes along the lines of “Look, up from the screen / My god, ran away / Don’t run away / We ran away / Don’t run away.” Good luck guessing what he’s talking about; maybe it’s better to witness Panda Bear’s rebirth firsthand, and let his deeply human narratives wash over us all once again.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "Highway Hypnosis", "artist": "Sneaks", "description": "Sneaks, aka Eva Moolchan, made her name on cool minimalism. With a discerning palette of bass, drum machines, and a slyly monochrome speak-sing, the Washington, D.C. artist created short post-punk songs that felt more like fragments, like snatches of possibility. Her anchor was an unimpeachably great sense of rhythm that made her understated oeuvre feel instantly classic.  Moolchan’s latest record and second for Merge,  , finds her coming deeper into her own beguiling voice. She sounds keenly self-aware of it, placing a cheeky skit right at the beginning: “Oh my gosh,  is coming out on Merge Records, get it today!” a voice squeals over a rattling beat. Soon after, on the coasting highlight “Ecstasy,” Moolchan leads a delightful chant: “Long / Live / Sneaks.” These self-referential twists give   a fun, conceptual edge. The title of one song, “Addis,” meanwhile, nods to her Ethiopian roots. That playful personality extends to the record’s inquisitive sound, as Moolchan extends her post-punk patchwork to include swaggering hip-hop and sun-dazzled lover’s rock.   rattles and slinks and rumbles with an epic wobble. Moolchan raps about Tech Deck skateboards, money, and an obsessed crush: “Holy cow, I never saw a girl like her!” goes one sticky refrain, turning each syllable into a staccato beat. What makes   such a marvel is how Moolchan takes her bigger-sounding influences and casts them into an atmospheric record that doesn’t lose any of the closeness or interiority of her previous recordings, nor their feeling of relative mystery. “I don’t wanna explain,” Moolchan sings on “Ecstasy,” “Running ’round the world with a planet of my own.” For 29 minutes, Moolchan teleports us there, even as she keeps the map a secret.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Though individual moments touch on contemporary masters like Angelo Badalamenti and John Carpenter, Pulichino uses them more as accents in his own language.

At a brisk 33 minutes,   never lingers too long on one scene, giving the softly drifting soundscapes a sense of momentum.

It’s a beautiful vision that he, along with accomplices Mariano and percussionist Nappy G, turned into one of the city’s most celebrated outdoor dance parties, Turntables on the Hudson. The club night, which debuted in 1998, quickly became known for its daring, eclectic, no-holds-barred aesthetic; in a single set, you could hear an obscure Puerto Rican salsa track, Spanish flamenco, a brassy Balkan beat jam, a batucada-inflected MPB track, and a sultry, New York house classic. Over the years, the party expanded, holding events in Barcelona, Ipanema, the Caribbean, and the Nile, and absorbing the sounds of those regions and pulling them into the Turntables universe.

The massive, 20-track compilation transports listeners to the middle of the dancefloor, with Nickodemus acting as tour guide through the sounds that defined the party’s vibe. The record opens with feel-good, reggae-funk and brass classics like “Roady” from the New Zealand band Fat Freddy’s Drop, and “Good Life” from the band Brassroots. Both songs blend seamlessly into one another, a nod to the mixture of funk, jazz, hip-hop, and house that are mainstays of Nickodemus’s live sets. From there, the compilation moves into the tropical decadence of Cotonete & Dimitri from Paris’ “Parribean Disco” and Bonobo’s “Cirrus,” seamlessly oscillating from high-energy club thumping to introspective dance jams at the drop of a hat. It also features its fair share of leftfield moments, like Trüby Trio’s flamenco track, “Jaleo,” and Oscar Sulley and the Uhuru Dance Band’s “Bukom Mashie,” a psychedelic Afrobeat banger. Collaborations like Quantic and Nickodemus’ rumba fusion jam “Mi Swing es Tropical” and the rap-funk collaboration “Gimme The Music” with The Real Live Show and Orchestre Poly-Rythmo are a testament of the power of a shared vision. Taken together, the songs on  create a kind of back-and-forth dialogue, a nod to the music that started it all, and a window into a hopeful future.", "genre": ["World", "dance"]}

Speaking about the experience to  Trappes compares it to when she learned her mother had Parkinson’s disease, saying, “[My mother] is still alive today and is a beautiful and courageous woman, but her losses made me realize I needed to understand grief more. I believe this is why I could empathize with my friends so deeply. Their stories helped me to heal. Death and grief are a part of life. If we can all share more, we can keep the love alive and keep moving forward.” Those dichotomies—death and life, grief and healing—course beneath the surface of  , a record that balances moments of almost tangible sorrow with moments of beautiful, elegiac release. The songs on   are perfectly crafted to suit those dual aims. There’s a kind of ghostliness about them—the way the guitars and keys and electronics feel wreathed in fog, the way Trappes’ voice drifts through them, like Elizabeth Fraser or Lisa Gerrard navigating a This Mortal Coil song. Songs like the haunting “Burn On” with its quietly pleading vocal line and big, distant, pealing pianos, seem to occupy the space where pain gives way to quiet acceptance. On “Maeve,” Trappes punctures extended held silences with big gongs of treated piano, so grand and fragile and majestic they feel like castles made of glass. That feeling of slow, weightless drift from one state to another is part of what makes the record so absorbing. The songs on  are both hushed and strangely sepulchral—but they also feel like long, slow exhalations; Trappes seems to know that the border between sadness and acceptance is vaporous.   exists in that middle space.", "genre": ["Alternative", "goth"]}
{"album": "Lost Time Behind the Moon", "artist": "Scott Hirsch", "description": "Much of Scott Hirsch’s musical attention over the past decade has been dedicated to the folk-rock ensemble  . He’s performed on, engineered, and produced several of the band’s records. As a solo artist, Hirsch brings some of the headier sensibilities of the earliest half of the Hiss Golden Messenger catalog into full bloom. His second standalone effort,  , offers a fresh batch of songs that kick back to classic country, tempered with a satisfying dose of psychedelia.  The album’s anxious opening salvos—wriggling, warped guitar and a sparse drum-machine beat, followed by a warm blast of old-soul horns—offer immediate insights into its unwieldy style. Hirsch develops these jittery arrangements as extensions of the album’s overarching themes of love, comfort-seeking, and (as suggested by the title) the passage of time. “Nothing But Time,” for example, finds Hirsch ruminating on the past with familiar remember-when fondness, without becoming too beholden to the good or the bad: “She’s in my head too much now / Not to mention in my dreams / And all these tales we’ve spun / They fell apart at the seams.” The relaxed pace that Hirsch maintains across   is a steadying force; Hirsch seems to approach his troubles with clear-headed thoughtfulness rather than scattered panic. Waves of pedal steel and pools of reverberating guitar lend a complementary sense of fluidity to the entire record, abetted by Hirsch’s cosmic lyricism on the lithe instrumental numbers “A Pair of Nines” and “Pink Moment.” By most accounts, reckoning with all the years we’ve lost, wasted—or even just passed without incident—is like fingering some existential hair-trigger. Hirsch’s record, by contrast, provides a comforting reminder of the inverse argument: it’s simply a matter of time.", "genre": ["Rock", "singer-songwriter", "indie rock"]}

And considering that the Sacramento quartet actually broke up in 2010, any new material at all is something of a bonus. The group’s uncertain lease on life informs the title of their new LP,  , which mirrors the spot-on garage revelry of 2004’s  . These are bash-and-thrash anthems delivered with enough burning urgency to sound genuinely threatening. While there is an obscure cover in The Jagged Edge’s “You Can’t Keep a Good Man Down”—one of two tracks sung with surprising melodic appeal by wild-card drummer Matt K. Shrugg—you don’t need to be a ’60s completist to appreciate this record. Anyone with a passing familiarity of early Kinks, Troggs, and Beatles rave-ups should be right on board from the opening title track, which announces the band’s blurted punch amid bruising drum fills. It’s the longest song here, at just over three-and-a-half minutes, with a chorus that’s among the album’s more restrained moments. From there, Shrugg, lead guitarist Mike Farrell, bassist Stan Tindall, and singer/guitarist Tim Foster ratchet up their tug-of-war between fine-tuned precision and all-out chaos. Witness the squalling guitar solo that fuzzes its way out of “To Die For,” or the surf-damaged start and surprise bass solo of the Who-ish “Time Has Come.” Reportedly the only album that producer Chris Woodhouse (Oh Sees, Ty Segall) agreed to record this year,   peaks with frantic closer “Too Late,” connecting every thrilling dot between mod rock and hardcore punk.", "genre": ["Rock", "punk rock", "garage"]}

In the context of Steve White’s 20-year career, however, it speaks volumes. His machine-augmented soulfulness—a paradoxical musical force, warmly organic and yet faintly futuristic—has been there since the days of the Spacek trio’s extraordinary, otherworldly 2001 debut,  , which found him and his compatriots fusing future-facing sounds with deep-spirited emotion. His adopted, cosmically-inspired surname gestures to the sci-fi sensibility that’s coursed through each of his projects, such as  , 2005’s chrome-laden solo debut. marks the end product of over 12 years of development; many of its tracks started as concepts dating back to the  era, which White subsequently and belatedly brought to fruition. White’s music has always followed its own path, though, and his stripped-back approach here ensures the songs don’t sound dated. His caramel-rich, offbeat vocal style sounds more assured than ever. The opening title track sets the template to follow: his voice positioned center stage, just two or three elements to complement it at any time. The two sides to White’s music sit more comfortably together than ever before, boundary-testing sonics balanced with lyrics that are earnestly heart-on-sleeve. There’s a poise to each of its songs, a confidence in their sparse, syncopated swagger. On “Deep Inside,” bass and drums are wonderfully off-kilter, White’s voice complemented by a warm glow of pads. “What would it take,” he softly sings, “for me to get into your soul?” His music has always told universal, time-worn stories in otherworldly tones, and perhaps nowhere so superlatively as here.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Fighting for Survival", "artist": "Yoruba Singers", "description": "  It was 1971, and Guyana had only just become a Republic—it had achieved independence from its British colonizers in 1966. It was a difficult time, but also one in which the Afro-Guyanese people endeavored to rediscover their roots.  It was against this backdrop that the Yoruba Singers began playing together. Black-consciousness movements had begun to flourish, and grassroots organizations thrived in their efforts to revitalize African culture. It was while working with one such organization that Eze Rockcliffe founded the Yoruba Singers, and it was in the basement of their offices that the band first started experimenting with cultural presentations of the Afro-Guyanese identity. The Yoruba Singers’ unique aesthetic and sound, which merged Guyanese rhythms, reggae, funk, and afrobeat, combined with their conscious lyrics and appreciation of their African heritage, made them stand out. They haven’t stopped playing since, and this year, the band celebrated their 47  anniversary. Considered by many to be Singers’ masterpiece, the 1981 album   was until recently available only to those willing to cough up hundreds of dollars for an original copy.  Fortunately for the rest of us,   has just reissued the album, which offers a gutsy blend of calypso, funk and afrobeat rhythms. The opening song, “Frustration”, begins with a prominent bass line, sharp drumming, and twangy guitars before bursting forth in a cluster of poly-rhythmic percussion and  jazzy keys, which give way to the funky, reggae-tinged “Revolution Day,” a scathing appraisal of Guyana’s colonial past. The subject of racism and colonialism is also present in the gut-wrenching power-ballad “Bleeding with Hate,” while on the title track, the band sings of their woes over deep, bluesy-funk riffs. The Yoruba Singers continue to tour and make music, but   remains their studio apex, an album that offers a glimpse into the power and pride of Guyana’s Black Consciousness movements.", "genre": ["World", "African"]}

Written in the wake of his father’s passing, and as Tweedy enters his 50s, these deeply intimate and skeletal songs consider what it means to remain in the present, what it means to be a link in a family chain, and what it means to appreciate the joys of life even as darkness threatens to swallow us whole. Rarely has Tweedy conveyed so much emotion with such sparse arrangements. On standout track “How Hard It is for a Desert to Die,” each vivid note of his acoustic guitar carries remarkable emotional heft. On opening track “Bombs Above,” he recounts his battle with opioid addiction in a near-whisper—“I’m taking a moment to apologize,” he sings—backed by knotted guitars and his elder son, Spencer, gently thumping the drums. Even “Let’s Go Rain,” a major-key jangle and the album’s most accessible track, utilizes its sunny melody as a foil for an allegory of total destruction, and the deception makes it all the more chilling. On “War on War,” from  , Tweedy proclaimed, with then-typical abstraction, that “You have to learn how to die / If you want to want to be alive.” Throughout  , he conveys his gratitude for that life with a clarity and solemnity that, finally, brings that sentiment into sharp focus. “I don’t believe in heaven,” he sings on the album’s title track.

Like   with a slight spring in their step, or   moving in slow motion, Hammock’s songs aren’t afraid to bask in the soft glow of their own beautiful melodies for whole minutes at a time. Their last studio album,  , delved into abstract themes of death and grief; its follow-up,  , is the second part of a planned trilogy and, as such, it begins to pull Hammock out of the darkness and into the light. Deeply felt details, like the melancholy vocal melodies in “Cliffside,” the swoon-worthy strings in “Mouth to Dust… Waiting,” and the melodramatic closing arc of “Tremendum,” offer glimmers of hope within the gloom. “Scattering Light” is a study in long exposure, a hushed bassline and tiny specks of guitar gradually joined by gentle violin and wreathed by quiet synths. And “We Watched You Disappear” blossoms slowly, strings building gradually, like morning light creeping in through the blinds.

The deviation wasn’t so much a schism as it was a pair of concurrent, opposing sea changes, the advents of J-pop and   (otherwise known as Japanese noise music), respectively. Where the former subgenre more or less upheld American hegemony through the incorporation of familiar stylistic and lyrical tropes, the latter presented cultural diffusion as a dissonant, chaotic ritual, lacking an obvious western analogue. And then there were the mysterious Space Streakings, a legion of oddballs (and according to rumor, erstwhile video game programmers) with names like Captain Insect and Karate Condor, who demolished the above binary to transcendent effect through an unprecedented, criminally underrated merger of grindcore percussion, jazz-funk fanfare, industrial effects, screamo vocals, and glitched-out hip-hop—all before suddenly disappearing in the late 1990s, never to be heard from again.  More than two decades after the band’s last output, experimental music bastion Skin Graft (who released much of the band’s recordings, most notably 1994’s Steve Albini-abetted   7”) has brought the maniacs’ whole discography to Bandcamp for the very first time.

An untrained musician who picked up the folk harp at 18 and taught herself to play, Rubin has spent the past few years crafting a musical oeuvre that plays like an act of spontaneous creation. In the past, her skeletally simple songs have sounded as though they were being conjured up in the moment of listening, as much   as art created for a wider audience. Sonically, Rubin’s music falls somewhere within the nexus of sound collage, nebulous soundscapes, and the slightest, most intimately personal of folk songs.  , Rubin’s third release and first recorded in a studio, arranges these elements into a sonic time loop of hypnotic harp lines that cascade over booming, march-like beats and only the sparest of ornamentation around her rich, affected vocals, colored by the occasional field recording snippet. The songs tumble gently into each other, creating an atmosphere both calming and slightly eerie, as Rubin’s internal monologue unspools. Producer Phil Hartunian—who also contributed bass, drums, and guitar to the record—gives Rubin’s sound a newfound spaciousness that gives her music a sense of elegance while preserving the unforced purity of her earlier releases. Yet for all its palatial grandeur, there’s something steely about the record. Beneath Rubin’s untrained approach and unfiltered nursery rhyme lyrics is a tough-as-nails creative ambition that demands to be recognized. Continuing the conversation she began on 2016’s  , on I , Rubin deals directly with the struggles of pursuing an artistic life. She bounces from joyful highs (“Out of the Woods”) to gloomy lows (“Why Am I Not Getting Any Better?”) as she ruminates on wanting “to be somebody” without losing herself in the process. Rubin doesn’t go in for metaphor; her lyrics are refreshingly forthright, whether she is wallowing in self pity (“Your life is not as hard as the life you think you’ve led,” she chides herself) or drawing from a deep well of artistic self-respect (“One day they will pay me / One day they will”). On “Peaks and Valleys,” her layered vocals come together in a garbled proclamation that brims with quiet dignity, encapsulating the journey Rubin is undertaking with her art: “I can accept the consequence of doing what I do / I can respect the magic of a life that’s always new.”", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"]}
{"album": "Tangerine Reef", "artist": "Animal Collective", "description": "Between their joyful odes to domesticity and their way of marveling at simple, shared experiences like fireworks and childhood holidays, Animal Collective have spent the last 18 years making fantastical music out of our most basic habits. Their latest album,  , takes this concept to immersive new depths—literally. Released as a collaboration with aquatic videography duo   to commemorate the   initiative, the album was conceived as an audiovisual exploration of some of the vibrant coral ecosystems blossoming beneath our oceans. Like the gorgeous footage that this music soundtracks,   is a surreal, slow-motion cycle of lush environments awash in neon tones, oozing with a love for the environment that lays the foundation for Animal Collective to create their own private aquarium of drifting sounds. Panda Bear is notably absent from the proceedings here (a first for the group), making room for Avey Tare, Geologist, and Deakin to largely dispense with song structures, and instead luxuriate in their amorphous, liquid textures. “Buxom” floats along with sparse, bubbling arpeggios, while “Hip Sponge” is punctuated by Avey Tare’s primal yelps, and the lovely “Jake And Me” revolves around soothing drones buoyed by a gentle, pirouetting bassline. There’s a calm sense of wonder at the heart of it all, as well as an alarming unease at the possibility of losing these underwater communities to the ever-increasing epidemic of climate change and global pollution. As both a call for environmental policy reform and a love letter to the untamed beauty of the natural world, Animal Collective have proven once again that kaleidoscopic experiences are everywhere; one only needs to step outside.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

{"album": "New Hymn to Freedom", "artist": "Szun Waves", "description": "It’s not difficult for a musician to become entrenched in doing their own thing. They spend years developing a personal style and voice so that one day, they can deliver the perfect representation of all of the sounds spinning around in their head, heart, and soul. And therein lies the risk in collaborations between established musicians: after spending so much time engrossed in their own individual projects, a certain creative intractability sets in. But this isn’t a bad thing; one of the highlights of a successful collaboration can be the collisions of perspective. An ideal outcome is when the artists involved can transcend individualism and create something greater than the sum of its parts. For psych-jazz trio Szun Waves, on their sophomore album  , everything falls right into place. With his Portico Quartet, saxophonist Jack Wyllie adapts his fiery delivery so that any heat generated marries with the hypnotic effects of hang drum and percussion. That approach translates seamlessly to Szun Waves. A track like “Temple” illustrates how lightning strikes of saxophone melody are no less essential to a stormy night enchantment as thick clouds of electronic effects and the susurrant murmur of drums. As a member of the jazz-electronica band Triosk, Laurence Pike thrived in an environment where his drums served as the rhythmic driving force behind the harmonic advances of keyboards, electric bass, and samples. This background serves him well on a track like “Constellation,” where his direct approach to tempo helps guide the increasingly volatile outbursts of synthesizers. And speaking of synthesizers, the sleight of hand Luke Abbott utilizes to make a melodic phrase imitate a rhythmic sequence on “Fall Into Rain” is a scheme that allows both Wyllie and Pike to shed their rhythmic responsibilities and just run free. And “running free” is important for this partnership;   is comprised entirely of improvisational material, live and unedited, where the need to express individuality is as important as the communication flowing between the members. Just as the dividing lines between rhythm, harmony, and melody grow fuzzy in the hands of musicians who embrace a multi-tasking approach to collaboration, so too do their individual contributions. Where a cry from saxophone ends and a harmonic wave from synthesizers begins is difficult to pinpoint, as is is the point of contact between the pulsing tempo of synthesizers and the rapid-fire rhythm of drums. For Szun Waves, these lines of demarcation are made irrelevant, because, in the end, it all becomes one.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

{"album": "Rockers From the Land of Reggae", "artist": "I-Mo-Jah", "description": "Philip Fullwood, co-founder of the Jamaican group I-Mo-Jah, spent his younger years surrounded by reggae royalty. One of his earliest friendships was with Freddie McKay, the rocksteady singer whose work in the early ‘70s combined the sweetness of American soul with the litheness of roots reggae. (It was Fullwood who penned McKay’s 1971 hit “Old Joe”.) A few years later, Fullwood’s journey into Rastafarianism would lead him to cross paths with another titan of the genre: Ras Michael, whose work with the Sons of Negus turns the deep mystique of dub into ritual music for Rasta worship, built around low, bobbing basslines and blissful group chants. So it’s no surprise that Fullwood’s sole record with I-Mo-Jah—the group he formed with Winston McKenzie and Cassandra Jenkins—would reflect both reggae’s soulful and spiritual sides. The record’s credits read like a who’s who of Jamaican music: Leroy “Horsemouth” Wallace and Sly Dunbar provide percussion, Robbie Shakespeare and Aston Barrett turn up on bass; and on trumpet, Burning Spear sideman Bobby Ellis. The all-star class reflects Fullwood’s social circle, but I-Mo-Jah don’t need the help:   is a powerful batch of roots music that was released in 1982 and somehow has never been reissued until the excellent UK label Pressure Sounds stepped in to right that wrong. What’s most gripping about   is the lack of division between the record’s Rasta and rocksteady elements; “Fools Rush In” has the easy groove and pulsing keys of an Alton Ellis love song, but the object of the song’s affection is Divine. Jenkins and Fullwood’s vocals intertwine beautifully on the refrain, occasionally echoing one another, occasionally harmonizing. “Jah Love” has the same low, hypnotic groove that Ras Michael worked with Sons of Negus, but Jenkins darting backing vocals could have been nicked from a ‘60s R&B single. The song is a masterwork of wide-open spaces, occasional bursts of chicken-scratch guitar invading the empty space between the tiptoeing bassline. Album closer “Weeping and Wailing” is a work of wonder: deep, spiritual group vocals punctuating funereal organ stabs and B.B. King-style guitar licks from Steve Goldstein. Out of circulation for far too long,   is a work of divine beauty.", "genre": ["Reggae"]}

While label founder Sleep D and regulars such as Dan White (who now records as Rings Around Saturn) work best in energy-raising techno, Sexton’s strength has been in catching you on the comedown. His spacious, downtempo productions and melodic bass playing have made him an essential part of the label through  , collaborations, and  . Now, he takes center stage on his debut album  , a collection of softly-enveloping synth jams as gentle as they are euphoric.  is actually the first full-length release on Butter Sessions, which has stuck strictly to singles and EPs over its eight years. That’s not abnormal for a dance label (LPs aren’t traditionally the genre’s focus), but the choice feels just right for Sexton. Tracks like opener “The Sump” and album highlight “Intercom” take full advantage of that sense of space, floating evocative melodies over watery atmospheres. It makes the basslines and synths feel just as impactful as the silences they dissolve into and emerge out from. Sexton balances  ’s woozy vibe with carefully placed highs. “KSS” threads a playful synth melody through tightly wound drum machine rhythms, while the rippling psychedelia of “Look Back And Lurch” is fueled by a punchy bassline. The best moments though come when Sexton slows down. The gorgeous single “Speak Into It” creates a vast foundation for Sexton’s evocative guitar leads, and it’s followed by the six-minute “Crowbar” where ghostly synths strobe in slow motion. Sexton lets everything burn straight down to its embers on the vast, beatless closer “LS2,” giving   a strong sense of scope (while inviting plenty of replays). It’s a slow-burning debut for a career that’s just heating up.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Endless Scroll", "artist": "BODEGA", "description": "the title of the debut album from NYC-based BODEGA, pulls off a tricky double meaning, equating internet consumption with long, ancient religious texts. The group return to that theme again and again across the album’s 14 tracks, picking apart our collective obsession with technology. Lyricists Ben Hozie and Nikki Belfiglio use deliberately mundane and unembellished language to conjure mundane and unembellished characters and settings, and their portrait of the modern age is unpretentious and all too realistic—often hilarious in its scorn and exasperation. The first moment of  ’s winkingly-titled second track, “Bodega Birth,” states the album’s thesis: “I use my computer for everything / Heaven knows I’m miserable now.” In both its content and its monotone delivery, the line addresses the ways our technological access leads to a kind of internal deadening. “Bookmarks” is even more direct: “All day at work / Stare at computer/ Come home from work / Stare at computer,” drilling down on the banality of constant access. It’s not all screens, though: On opener “How Did This Happen?!,” BODEGA lament how technology has led to political complacency and “slacktivism”; “Can’t Knock The Hustle,” with its quips about nine-dollar smoothies and hourly salaries—and a sardonic chorus that goes, “You can’t knock the hustle / When the cats are making capital”—is an anti-capitalist anthem that socialist organizations could adopt as their fight song. Such straightforward lyricism demands music that’s equally unflashy, and BODEGA’s simple, wiry arrangements rise to the occasion. The songs are built from little more than slightly overdriven guitars, simple, driving drums, and Belfiglio and Hozie’s yelped vocals. Just as BODEGA’s lyrics plainly and boldly analyze our current state, so too are the songs striking in their direct, yet incisive, arrangements.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}

By culling samples from tour stops across Asia, Australia, North America, and Morocco, Davids and Ivory have created a stunning kaleidoscope of sound which serves not only as a record of the duo’s lived experiences and their inspirations, but a vehicle by which the listener can get in tune with the beauty of the world—as well as with humanity at large. is an album where field recordings commingle with house-style piano melodies, soaring choirs, and samples of everything from Belgian jazz (“Vale”) to obscure ’70s funk-rock (“Turnmills”). It opens with the melancholy “Beginners Luck,” a track with winding, layered vocals that owe as much to Celtic song as its stuttering rhythms do trip-hop; it’s the sole moment of tranquility on an album which otherwise makes good on its title with arrangements flush with euphoria and color. Album standout “Kingdom” is particularly vibrant, leavening its soca-like percussion grooves with darting highlife guitars and a looped flute sample, while “Kāma” unfolds as a synth-heavy dance party, pensive but blissful.

{"album": "Events Score", "artist": "Daniel Davies", "description": "When the child of a famous musician decides to follow their parents’ path it can sometimes be challenging for them to establish themselves as an artist in their own right. Daniel Davies, the son of The Kinks’ Dave Davies, fell victim to that struggle on his 2011 debut EP  , which cast him as the lead singer and guitarist of a rock trio. In the following years, however, he found his own voice by helping another,  reclaim his. Davies has been essential to the horror director and composer’s late-career resurgence, touring live and working on Carpenter albums including   and the upcoming new   score. Now with the atmospheric  , Davies has made a debut album that demonstrates his own considerable strength as a composer. Though Davies’s palette is distinct from Carpenter’s icy minimalism, he does conjure some “lost themes” of his own with eerie, proggy soundscapes that could be written for an imaginary horror film. Clouds of ominous synths hover on tracks like “Shadows Alive.” That track begins as a lullaby, built around a delicate harpsichord, before heavier tones fill out the bottom end and the entire song dissolves like a bad dream. Spindly guitars and dark synths dwell on “XXT” but the brisk percussion lifts it with an almost jazzy airiness. “Endless Blue” opens as pure drone, but methodically builds to a cathartic melody. It offers a rare brightness that only makes the rest of  inky darkness more unsettling. The eight tracks over  ’s 31 minutes are all relatively short, but Davies’s vivid productions give the album a greater scope. The influence of Carpenter is undeniable and Davies carries on The Kinks’ pioneering skill in making the harpsichord sound  , but more than anything it feels like a showcase of his own burgeoning compositional talent.

Aside from being ageist, it is also couldn’t be further from the truth. Take someone like Kim Gordon, for example. At 65, the ex-Sonic Youth member is making some of her most experimental music to date with Body/Head, her collaborative guitar-based project with Bill Nace. Nace and Gordon may only present half the number of tracks that appeared on their 2013 debut,  , but they manage to stretch them out into new realms on  . There’s a fundamental sparseness to this album, one that takes a step even further back from their minimal, abstract debut and allows space to swish around with potency. Opener “Last Time” begins like an Earth song, but rather than head into crunchy guitar overdrive and rumbling drones, the pair embrace the power of restraint, thoughtfully stepping in and out of each other’s guitar parts like ballroom dancers. Tone is crucial, and they allow guitars to whirr and hum with static hiss; the eerie, woozy,  -like ambience on “In the Dark Room” creates a presence that is alternately immersive and distancing. Gordon’s vocals wail under a sea of ever-shifting guitar feedback on “Change My Brain,” and the closing “Reverse Hard” bubbles away with a quiet force, as though faraway sounds are creeping in through a window that has been left open, shifting from remoteness to claustrophobia. All of this combines to make a record that is clearly still trying to extract something new from the guitar, and it does so with an audacious sense of fearlessness.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

{"album": "Nose Picker", "artist": "Negative Scanner", "description": "On their new record  Chicago’s Negative Scanner perfect their formula for cheeky, guitar-forward post-punk wit. The album begins with vocalist Rebecca Valeriano-Flores hollering in a ridiculous faux British accent, “Is there anybody there?” The response comes in the form of a lightly-overdriven guitar, which plunges into the empty space with brash, simple bar chord hammering, propped up with snare and kick. That combination lays the sonic and thematic groundwork for  , which flits between levity (“You’re picking sides like you pick your nose!” Valeriano-Flores sneers on the title track) and gravity (“In the city there’s 10 million men in uniform and they got a right to kill,” she howls on “10 Million Kids”). Negative Scanner excel at relaying these bite-size sentiments in tight, succinct blasts that rarely run more than two minutes. The record is efficient and poppy, with elevated BPMs and power-pop inclinations, but it’s bitter enough to balance the sweetness thanks to its proudly unpolished production and Valeriano-Flores’s idiosyncratic vocal style. On “The Only One,” backed by Matt Revers’s driving guitars, Nick Beaudoin’s chugging bass, and Tom Cassling’s no-frills drumming, Valeriano-Flores trudges along in a resigned low register, while her roars on “Let It Die” recall the no-quarter delivery of Downtown Boys’ Victoria Ruiz. “A Vision” splits the difference, trading off between indifferent, machine-like baritone and enraged yells.  straddles a fence between twisted power pop and catchy post-punk in the vein of contemporaries like Vancouver’s Dumb and Portland’s Lithics. But Negative Scanner embrace the absurd (see the record’s hilarious cover) to elevate, complicate, and ultimately enrich an infectious, white-knuckle guitar record.", "genre": ["Alternative", "punk rock"]}
{"album": "Here From Where We Are", "artist": "Pariah", "description": "It’s hard not to see the current wave of ambient music as a reaction to an ever uglier and more uncertain world. Certainly, there’s been a move from many people in the club world into producing purely textural music, the kind that feels like a bath for the soul. The template has been set by the   collective in London, with a whole set of musicians from in and around the London bass world making songs that are unapologetically blissful and New Age-inspired. Now, Arthur Cayzer, who records as Pariah, has followed a similar trajectory, moving from dubstep and grime to enveloping beatlessness on his latest release,  . Formerly a punk and hardcore musician, seduced by dubstep into making complex bass-heavy electronic constructions, and latterly the producer of austere techno as half of Karenn with Jamie “ ” Roberts, he apparently hit a bout of writer’s block before realizing that he could solve his problem by ditching his drum machines and letting these airy concoctions flow over, under, and around the block. The opener, “Log Jam” perhaps describes that creative block itself: it’s the one piece on this album that feels solid and weighty, its intense chords chugging like turbocharged Steve Reich. After that, there are two modes: tracks like “Pith,” “Conifer,” and “Here From Where We Are” float suspended on sustained chords, as if willing time to a standstill. The rest of the album is airborne, tumbling on eddies of arpeggio, reminiscent of the 1970s ambience of Steve Hillage’s  , or the ‘90s space exploration of Pete Namlook and  ’s  .

On  , James Ketchum and Leon Hu capture what the tropics could sound like in the modern age, where an increasingly varied cluster of influences combine to create truly fascinating music. The reference points are all over the place—video games, lo-fi beat masters, hip-hop, salsa greats, Brazilian Tropicália, psych rock—and all of them are blended and transformed into bewildering little worlds that contain multitudes. The album plays out like a fever dream soundtracked by warped guitar loops, steel drums, lush, velvety synths, and twinkling ‘70s Tropicália piano. In fact, the music of Brazil figures heavily across  . Afro-Brazilian percussion provides the foundation for songs like “Ogre Heights” and the funkified “Air Walk,” and what sounds like a pitched-up   drum surfaces in tracks like “Ogre World” and “Dreams.” There’s also a shout-out to the cadences and production style of dub, with sounds materializing and disappearing at the drop of a hat. This collage work comes together beautifully and blissfully in album standout “Midnight Carousel,” in which Mondo Lava juxtapose Casio melodies with Afro percussion and cowbell solos, toned-down space echo breaks, jazz melodies, and what sounds like a looped sample of bird-of- paradise.  is an ambitious effort that succeeds in creating a truly immersive world for its listeners—one that manages to throw the notion of “tropical” on its head, and that is calming and insane in equal measures.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}
{"album": "Touch Dissolves", "artist": "Aaron Martin", "description": "With its ability to deliver both thick melodic lines as well as enveloping harmonies, the cello is a natural choice for artists looking to create a mood of tranquility.  Over the course of his recording career, Aaron Martin’s knack for using the instrument to generate mournful tones, disquieting harmonic undercurrents, and the unwinding of melodies has opened up a world of nuance to a series of striking solo pieces. That being said, there’s an argument to be made that Martin’s signature works are his collaborations. His duo   with Dag Rosenqvist, and his contribution to the Dronarivm release   with Christoph Berg, are prime examples of the ways chamber instrumentalism and electronic effects can peacefully coexist. Martin’s newest,  , is a different type of creative partnership, one that incorporates both a solo perspective and sympatico connection. The sixth installment of the IIKKI label’s duet series pairs Martin’s cello with the photographs of Yusuf Sevinçli.   captures the transformation of images from sharp reality to the ephemeral presence of dream. Similarly, Martin’s instrumentation traces the slow dissipation of a distinct and present melody into thick harmonic clouds that slowly drift away. And as it was on Martin’s 2018 release , the breadth of instrumental expressionism expands far beyond just the reach of his cello, ranging from roll-up piano to concertina to guitar to glockenspiel. The instrument’s sounds may differ, but they all create a similar state of serenity. The gentle downpour of bells from a singing bowl on “A Child’s Arms Are Moonlight” provides a whispering accompaniment to the cello’s swaying lullaby. The appearance of banjo on “Guarded Eyes Make Curtains Blossom” provides strong resonance, but when it’s eventually bowed, the effect brings it close to the way Martin uses the cello. In “To Stems Unclasped the Petals Cling” the twang, sparkle and sigh of lap steel, ukulele, and cello serve to both complement and contrast.  is a world inside a world, where lively activity exists inside every expression of peacefulness.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

Formed in Hobart, Tasmania before relocating to Melbourne, the underground punk quartet played with Bikini Kill, Fugazi, and The White Stripes during their initial lifespan, yet never released anything beyond a few short tapes. Until now. Little Ugly Girls have pulled together recordings new and old for a self-titled collection that stamps a forceful exclamation mark on their cult career. It’s the kind of scalding, squalling record that would get a young band anointed with instant hype. But more importantly, it’s the definitive introduction to an on-again, off-again band that feel every bit as powerful now as they did in the ’90s. The center of gravity is frontwoman Linda Johnston, whose voice swings from an urgent rasp and banshee-level release on opener “Tractor” to a tender whisper on “Storm After Storm.” She’s backed by her brother, guitarist Dannie Johnston, who favors ominous churnings and volcanic surges, alongside the thundering rhythm section of bassist Mindy Mapp and drummer Brent Punshon. Despite the fact that half of the album’s songs finish around the two-minute mark, it’s hard not to be left shaken by the band’s snarling attack. On the album’s longest track, “Vinegar,” Linda leans into the flinty, authoritative mantras that are her signature. “Would you say it’s magic?” she asks a few times, before repeating “Pull out all my hair and smoke my cigarettes” like some dire incantation as the music lurches and circles with mounting power. More devastating, though, is what comes immediately after: The closing “Boxen-Hooda-Hayda” is a bittersweet a cappella number centered around Linda’s doubled vocals.

Bands like Don Caballero, OXES, Drive Like Jehu, Craw, and Dazzling Killmen put angular sounds on the map, then vanished, save for sporadic reunion shows, reissues, or reinventions (like Don Cab’s latter-day second act). Lifers like Shellac and Bellini have pressed on. Kindred spirits of sorts, the Chicago-based, Steve Albini-led trio and the Italian/American four-piece have traced similar paths over the last two decades. Both bands fastidiously—and unapologetically—bang it out, old-school ‘90s-style, offering an off-kilter assault of nails-on-chalkboard riffs, locked-in bass and drums grooves, and speak-scream vocals—part math rock smarts, part post-punk angst with DIY heart-on-sleeve. Nearly 10 years separates Bellini’s   and their latest   and in that period, the veteran unit—with members spread out across the world in Italy, Texas, and New York—sound as tightly knit as ever, ratcheting up the mangled string-bending, ear-piercing dissonance, neck-snapping rhythms and emotive energy that’s been their M.O. since their 2002 debut,  . Fittingly recorded by Albini (he’s presided over every Bellini release since day one),   showcases vocalist Giovanna Cacciola, guitarist Agostino Tilotta, and the rock-solid rhythm section of bassist Matthew Taylor and Girls Against Boys drummer Alexis Fleisig in the finest of jagged and in-your-face form. Caught on tape by Albini back in 2012 but only now seeing the light of day,   runs the gamut, from knotty math-metal and scorched-earth punk rock to psychedelic noise tripping. With spazzy guitars and thrashing beats cranked up to ten on opening track “Greek Fire,” Cacciola—one of the most overlooked and unique singers in underground rock—spews out mostly undecipherable fragmented spit ‘n’ vinegar in her heavy Italian accent. “Don’t be scared / You should not be scared of me,” she wails on “Greek Fire” before launching into rippers like “Clementine Peels,” “Plumber’s Foxtrot,” and “Being Married.” With Shellac gearing up for a late summer/fall tour and Bellini making their triumphant return after a decade-long absence, it’s high time to nerd out on math rock again.", "genre": ["Alternative", "math rock"]}

Her voice flutters, regal as the flutes and parade of drums behind it, like a movement that is equal parts hymn and march. The Los Angeles artist isn’t afraid to challenge her listeners as much as she does herself; when she sings of renewal, it could just as easily apply to the rebirth that happens from song to song. Each song highlights different elements of her seemingly boundless artistic impulses. “Delphine,” for example, creeps along a plodding bassline as Bonet’s soulful vocals—wispy falsetto blues lullaby with thoughtful lyrics—command the space, while “Joy” features a brief angelic chorus that gives way to a striking bed of strings and woodwinds. The former is a testament to her gorgeous vocal abilities, the latter to her impeccable musicianship. Though the spirit of Minnie Riperton’s legendary soprano is felt throughout  , it’s perhaps no more vivid than on lead single “Mother Maybe,” an elegant meditation on the divinity of feminine power. “You’re the deep and secret sea,” Bonet sings, “acquiesce in colors siphoned from the love that is me.” On the song’s back half, Bonet ascends to her whistle register, climbing steadily to a piercing and gorgeous crescendo. This is still her most powerful instrument. The benefit of handling your own soundtrack is only having to decipher your own voice. Bonet is able to craft backdrops that accentuate the range of her musicality, whether that means putting her professional training to use or allowing her instincts to lead. She is a breath of fresh air in a sea of overly produced synthetic textures, and   is her transcendent moment—a portal into another dimension when this one just isn’t enough.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul", "avant-garde"]}

In dubstep’s half-step lurch, experimental electronica like Andy Stott and Arca, alt-R&B, post-FlyLo beat-scene psychedelics, Berlin techno’s retreat from pounding extremes—even the reggaetón-influenced mainstreaming of tropical house—there was a retreat from the idea of beat as “driving” and into looser, more limber relationships between drum programming and dancers’ bodies. One of the most interesting crucibles for this experimentation has been a half-tempo zone in drum & bass. Artists like dBridge, Om Unit, Sam Binga, Japan’s ENA, and San Diego’s ASC have in various ways opened up d ‘n’ b’s spaces and saved it from the harder-faster-denser sonic arms races that drove some of its variants into an evolutionary dead end. ASC has taken those lessons and started applying them to other templates. Having spent his last two albums on entirely ambient drones, he’s now exploring a place completely between genres—using the same moody sound palette as his previous records, but going across the tempo range, and crucially using patterns of three beats, rather than the 4/4 patterns of 99.99% of dance records. Oddly, despite this unorthodox rhythmic approach, the record sounds strangely familiar: the tonality, the flow, the bodily impact of the sub-bass, all echo early dubstep, Drexciya-style Detroit electro, and ASC’s own half-step d ‘n’ b. Yet as you get absorbed into the swirling waltzes, they will take you to strange, intergalactic places. Certainly adventurous DJs could play this too—and the dances that people will do should prove to be pretty interesting.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Even when PKP was more or less a bedroom project, Hanlon showed a knack for crafting punk songs that came across as lightweight while belying a fierceness and discipline that the thick layers of lo-fi gloop on her first few releases couldn’t entirely obscure. Peach Kelli Pop come into their own as a band on their fourth full-length,  The record features the contributions of bassist and guitarists Gina and Sophie Negrini (who also play in Hanlon’s live band) and drummer Andrew Bassett of the Mean Jeans, which give   a sonic fullness that Peach Kelli Pop lacked when it was just Hanlon bashing away in her bedroom. But this is still Hanlon’s show.

Studio polish removes the fuzz that once muted the band’s hooks, and the newfound clarity allows every facet of PKP’s tightly coiled sound to sparkle in the light of Hanlon’s exuberant presence.   also features some of Hanlon’s strongest songwriting to date, showing a transition from basic garage rock structures to more sophisticated arrangements rooted in the indie pop school of punk, a natural fit for her growing musicianship. The band dives right in with “Hello Kitty Knife,” a giddy celebration of self-care and self-defense played breathlessly fast with guitar tones so bright they stop just short of screeching. Propulsive earworm “Black Magic” takes its cues from power pop, but sports more than a hint of Heavenly in its lyrics. Hanlon dials down her hyperactive energy on several tracks, including the adorable “King Size,” a tender song about a pit bull with a heart of gold (one of two songs about animals on  ). As a lyricist, Hanlon’s outlook is positive—“Don’t Push Me” is the closest she gets to a straight-out rebuke on the entire record—but PKP is a punk band, and the best songs on   have a kind of self-aware cheekiness that dares you to dismiss them as novelty. “Cherry (That’s Not Her Real Name)” is peak Peach Kelli Pop, a vivacious bubblegum gem that’s the perfect blend of tart and sweet, the band spinning around manically around on three cheerful chords.

Yet instead of coming across as scattershot or overly busy, the collective effort gives  the feel of a zany, extended family vacation; even when she’s digging into the depths of her own misery—as on the album’s sprawling centerpiece, “Curse of the I-5 Corridor”—Case and company can’t help but saturate these songs with sunny arrangements that belie the lyrics’ harsh realities. “Halls of Sarah” describes a wounded and absent companion, but does so over a honeyed guitar figure and the sort of magnetic melody Case favored with frequent collaborators the New Pornographers; later, “Bad Luck” boasts a radiant chorus that’s deliberately at odds with its dour sentiment. That balance of playfulness and tragedy has run consistently through Case’s work, but on   she has sharpened her wit to a dagger’s edge. On the title track, God appears as a “lusty tire fire”: “I cried so hard I pissed myself,” she sings over a glam-y groove on “My Uncle’s Navy.” The line “I fucked every man that I wanted to be,” from “Curse of the I-5 Corridor,” is as multilayered as it is acerbic. Perhaps some of this saltiness can be credited to Case’s recent run-in with tragedy; as has already become something of lore, her Vermont home burned down during the album’s completion.

Perhaps it was the latter that has made her adept at translating complex feelings—like desire, loneliness, and desolation, to name a few—into intricately crafted electronic folk compositions. Nothing is gratuitous with Woods. The silences are calculated, the percussion is sparse, reverberating like heavy footsteps in an empty corridor; the synths soar momentarily, then wither away. It’s music that leaves you in a strangely pensive state. That feeling forms the backbone of her debut album,  where the Dublin-based musician carefully uses string arrangements, acoustic guitars, tape fuzz, piano, and synths to soundtrack her journey through grief, self-acceptance, abandonment, and a shape-shifting love. The album opens with “Inhaler,” a track consisting of nothing more than a bare piano, synths, and percussion, showcasing both Woods’s velvety vocals and her poetic prowess. It’s a beautiful song, as unsettling as it is comforting, where Woods deals with the sadness and uncertainty of lost love. On “Inhaler,” the notes are enveloped in echo, a technique that makes her yearning feel that much more palpable. “Kith” is a solemn ballad, anchored by an acoustic guitar and underscored by a barely-there synth line that sounds like the low howl of the wind. The music perfectly echoes lyrics that talk about feeling suffocated and trying to find a place to breathe.  is an album full of such overwhelming moments, where it becomes clear that Woods has been traveling a long, difficult path. But there are also moments of sudden respite: “Jesus Said” is predominantly beat-based, with Woods juxtaposing a delicate classical piano with a dance rhythm, making for a tense listen about emptiness and doubt. On  Woods proves herself to be an accomplished composer, reveling in the nuances and carefully weaving melodies, sounds, and instruments into a sonic landscape that provides a place for comfort and healing—not just for the listener, but for Woods as well.", "genre": ["Ambient", "dark ambient"]}

Those textures, along with the creative use of shoegaze genre staples such as droning guitars, lots of echo, delay, and distortion, and Bogren’s thin, melodious vocals make for a hazy listen, meant to evoke nostalgia for a youth long past and a weary worry for what the future might hold. The lead single “Bedroom,” for example, is a chaotic blend of staccato drumming and euphoric synths, as Bogren dreamily sings about the freedom of loneliness and the complete madness that can come along with it, while tracks like “Almost Happy” and “Apart” are delicate and heavily distorted ballads about love and longing, that progress slowly but pack a punch to the gut.

After 90 seconds of a glitchy electronic undercurrent, Branch and Nazary—whose synergistic relationship began in 2002 at the New England Conservatory—start to slowly map out a sonic territory that they’ll carefully explore for the rest of the album, one where the duo’s differentiated grooves can recall anything from the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble to the pulsing, melodic rock of ’90s  .

Volume 1", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "There’s no denying the massive weight   has in the history of house music—the name conjures up the sights and sounds of a beautifully diverse, extremely creative and hedonistic Chicago dance underground. Founded in 1983, the label was by no means the only one releasing house music when the style exploded onto the mainstream in the 1980s and 1990s, but it remains one of the most influential and pioneering names in the genre, releasing music by greats like Frankie Knuckles, Screamin’ Rachael (TRAX’s co-founder and current president), Jesse Saunders, Marshall Jefferson, and Farley Jackmaster Funk, among others. Keeping up with the label’s cutting-edge and independent spirit, their newest compilation,  showcases the best of TRAX Records’ releases in the past decade, giving a nod to house music’s roots and steering it towards the future. The compilation opens with Carmelo Carone’s “Chicago (Original Mix),” a classic four-to-the-floor anthem with sultry vocals that transport you directly to the bump and grind of a lit up dancefloor. Along with Lois Plugged and Fruckie’s “Gotta Have House,” both tracks serve as superb primers to Chicago house history, the latter consisting of a spoken word track underscored by 4/4 beats detailing the spirit and significance of the Warehouse club parties.  also gives due representation to the Latinx influence in the music’s heyday with Ckrono’s proto-dembow, body-slamming track, “Toma.” The compilation also features Screamin’ Rachael’s signature punk howl in standout tracks like “The British Are Coming” and “Spirits Rising,” the latter feeling like a high octane seance—Screamin’ Rachael conjuring the spirits of dance to take us on a magical tour through late-night bliss under the light of a thousand disco balls. is probably the most fun you’ll ever have connecting the dots between house music history and the sights and sounds that inspired (directly or indirectly) all of your current favorite DJs and producers.

On her debut solo outing as Vive la Void, Yamada sinks even deeper into her signature synths, moving from Moon Duo’s Stone Roses dreamworld toward a direction more influenced by Kraftwerk. If that band remains a touchstone for many contemporary electronic musicians, it may be because the playful futurism of songs like “Computer Love” seem quaint in the context of our current techno-hell.

Across 10 tracks and 28 minutes, Graham channels his influences, skillfully cutting and pasting a litany of recorded vocals, wind instruments, bleeps, bloops, and acousmatic phenomena. The results can get dense and chaotic, but it’s clear from the unexpectedly gorgeous first track, “My desire for you is to stop being a fuck wad,” that Graham remains in control of his source material. As goofy and frenetic as his compositions may sound, they all come together to form tight, memorable songs. On many Orange Milk releases—like Graham’s 2013 collaboration with label cofounder Keith Rankin,  —the artists use difficult sounds and an abundance of silence to make riotously fun approximations of pop or dance music. While  is further removed from pop than  is, moments like the sax “solo” and dramatic caesura in the middle of “RMB” or the propulsive second half of “Binary Tapioca” offer the structure and uplift one looks for in a great pop track.

His music embodies the persona of its lead MC, and in the case of Brown (on his critically acclaimed 2016 album  ), White’s score felt dark and cavernous, clattering beneath the rapper’s distinctive squeal. White’s solo projects have been equally disjointed on purpose: 2010’s   and 2011’s   were kitchen sink records that put the composer’s grand affinities on full display, and paired obscure vocal clips with percussive space funk and electronica.

Featuring singers Denai Moore, Shungudzo, and Paul’s own sister Sarah Williams White, it’s a meditative release that’s less about the shock and awe of White’s sonic palate, and more about establishing a relaxed atmosphere for his guest’s hearty affirmations. “Laugh With Me” is about just that—the freedom of cracking a smile with loved ones by the sea. The title track is sunny and stampeding, a beachy instrumental with light guitar chords and echoed synths that punctuate the album’s breezy aura.   is the record you play by the pool, or during long drives along the coast.

Go to a Hunee set, and you’re as likely to bask in vintage slo-mo from Brazil as you are bone-shaking techno—often in the same hour. And while the artist born Hun Choi is known for laser focus behind the decks (sometimes intimidatingly so), he still manages to find time to twirl around the booth, eyes closed, hands in the air.

His latest project for Rush Hour,  , collects four decades of rare, exquisite music that—like his DJ marathons—are in one way or another danceable, but not limited to purely electronic selections. He kicks off with the calming Portuguese melodies of Carlos Maria before turning towards the African continent for heavy tunes from Malian artist Boncana Maïga and Benin’s Stanislas Tohon, whose glittering Afro-disco anthem “Owhaaou!

Hot Snakes have always been a loud and abrasive band, but there’s a manic energy at work on their fourth album that feels unexpectedly urgent for a band who have spent the better part of the past decade-and-a-half offstage and out of the studio. On the 78-second standout “Why Don’t It Sink In?”, John Reis’s guitar sounds lethal in its barbed-wire scrape, and vocalist Rick Froberg screeches out the song’s title. A song this brief, noisy, and unrelenting doesn’t offer the listener much of a chance to let  sink in—you just endure and survive it. Much like their short, explosive songs, the first wave of Hot Snakes’ career was also brief and concentrated: three albums in five years and an unceremonious (if temporary) end, brought about by grown-up responsibilities like fatherhood. Within six years, the band slowly made their way back to festival stages, eventually followed by the unlikely reunion of Froberg and Reis’s other band, Drive Like Jehu, before Hot Snakes finally made it to the studio six years into their comeback. And it’s hard not to hear that band’s complex post-hardcore sensibility seething through the twisted time signatures and discordance of tracks like “Candid Cameras.” At its core,  bears all of the elements that made up Hot Snakes’ excellent first trio of albums: a sharp clash of guitars, pummeling punk-rock rhythms, and Froberg’s frantic, strained bark. Yet there’s even more tension and agitation than usual, even for a band whose discography is founded on that very agitation. On “Psychoactive,” the band’s wall of guitars is dense and imposing, while the churning title track evokes the nickname of German propaganda symbol in an ominous metaphor for Trump’s America: “Started as a whisper / Now it’s a campaign.” Only closing track “Death of a Sportsman” allows much space in, an ominous organ riff reminiscent of Suicide’s “Ghost Rider” rumbling under the feedback and reverb. But even that comes roaring back seemingly more potent than how it began. It’s a fitting metaphor for the band itself, who prove that which burns brightest can still be reignited.", "genre": []}

It was a scrappy, student-run venture, and a great spot for a jazz composer and self-proclaimed alien. He’d record at the station several times until 1980. For Sun Ra, an Afrofuturist who believed true peace for black people resided in outer space, finding solace anywhere on Earth was quite a surprise.

Take “Island…” as an example: A   from 1974’s  , Sun Ra quickens the rhythm with thicker percussion, adding harmonic chants that bolster the track’s divine essence. “Unmask the Batman” is also given new life on this set: with its deep scatting, piano stabs and winding horns, the song properly retains the original’s blustery swing. Then there’s “I’ll Wait For You,” a robust funk-fusion cut that appears on  .

Their debut LP,  , was mostly a Minissali solo affair, but on  , they’ve added a full band, with Rhonda Lowry on drums, Nathanial Morgan on bass, and Ellen O and Angelica Bess on backing vocals. Over the course of its 30 minutes,   repeatedly disintegrates the notion of genre, concocting pop tunes for museums and left-field gems for the club. On album opener “Gun-metal Grey,” a melting synth line locks in with a stadium-ready drum beat beneath Minissali’s falsetto, which sounds a bit like David Longstreth might after years of vocal lessons. The track feels like a lost   B-side, full of sleek mystery and slithering ambience. Elsewhere, on “Love-gun,” the band is awash in layers of haze as Minissali sings, “I’m gonna get a house and forget everybody,” as if he’s trying to convince himself that, in our interconnected world, escape is still possible. The group execute the stacked vocal harmonies that open “Vaccination Free” like a note-perfect Queen cover band, before giving way to heat-warped synths and stuttering drums.

The time since,  has been marked by artistic highs for Elverum—he returned to live performance for the first time since 2014, and the record was met with widespread acclaim. But it also, understandably, was colored by emotional lows.   paints a picture of a man navigating that divide. About halfway through  ’s title track, he describes performing “these death songs to a bunch of young people on drugs” at a music festival, talking with fellow artists about songwriting, before noting that “to be alive felt so absurd.” Then comes the track’s gently melodic chorus, which begins, “People get cancer and die.” As that line indicates,   makes much use of surprise—emotional transitions happen quickly, as the dark wash of guitar on “Tintin in Tibet” makes way for a fingerpicked passage, above which Elverum recounts early romance with Castrée.  ’s unpredictability feels like a mirror of Elverum’s internal disorientation, finding reminders of his wife in unlikely places—while traveling, playing in his yard, making his daughter breakfast. On “Distortion,” he wonders, “Is it my job now to hold whatever’s left of you for all time?” Elverum is too honest on   to offer an answer to that question, but as “Distortion” nears its conclusion, he offers something softer and warmer: “In his tears right now,” he sings, “light gleams.”", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

The Montreal outfit’s mix of techno, EBM, industrial, and electro called to mind the gray soundscapes of Berlin’s electronic music underground in the ’90s, yet their take on the music felt fresh and extremely relevant in today’s grim political landscape. The fusion of Pierre Guerineau and Marie Davidson’s hard, thumping beats, and airy, eerie vocals—which were often used to decry the isolation, vices, and pitfalls of the late-stage capitalism—made for a sensual soundtrack to a dystopian world. Despite employing synth lines that sound like the aural equivalent of  , Essaie Pas still managed to maintain a tangible sense of hope. Their new album,  puts them on a slightly different path within that same journey. Heavily influenced by   Philip K.

The album opens with “Les Aphides,” a track with a menacing bassline that, listened to via headphones, feels like it’s throbbing inside your skull. Paired with Davidson’s unsettling whispers, the song sets the mood for a record that, much like  is full of paranoid intensity. “Futur Parlé” and “Complet Brouillé” sport industrial synths and electro beats, making for the kind of music that could score an apocalyptic party scene during the climax of a sci-fi film. “Les Agents des Stups,” with its speedy synths, space-like blips, and racing hi-hats, offers a momentary reprieve, but as Guerineau points out in the album notes, this moment of relief is an illusion—the opening of a doorway that may ultimately lead nowhere.  is a dizzying, intense, and rewarding ride into an unsettling future, offering glimpses of darkness and light in equal measures.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

First released in 1994, this is the same General MIDI unit that JRPG composers such as Nobuo Uematsu ( ) and Yasunori Mitsuda ( ) used to compose their masterpieces. Its 18-bit output and 654 preset tones may be sonically limited compared to today’s available hardware, but ironically its use makes the album even more resonant and affecting. Tracks like “Bygone Dreams” and “Flora Awakens” employ compressed, harp-like arpeggios and airy orchestration to create stirring, meditative songs. Together with more rousing, dynamic numbers like “Pontiff’s Pass” and “Synthetic Core 88 Awakens,” they invite a strong sense of narrative and thematic progression, a quality bolstered by Drew Wise’s excellent  -inspired visual art. Equip describes their sounds as “period-accurate.” This is true, but what’s remarkable about the piano-driven “New GAIA” or the tautly atmospheric “Scarred Streets, Oppressed Town” is not only do they sound  like an old JPRG, they also dupe the listener into thinking that they’ve played the game it scores before, even though no such game exists.

{"album": "Blueprint", "artist": "Alice Bag", "description": "It’s difficult to believe that   is only Alice Bag’s second solo album, but one thing is clear from the outset: more than four decades into a wide-ranging musical career—she fronted and co-founded ’70s punk pioneers the Bags, and has also played with Castration Squad, Cholita, and Las Tres—the musician/writer/educator is no stranger to galvanizing pivots. To that end,   is more eclectic than Bag’s 2016 self-titled effort. (Both albums were produced by Lysa Flores.) Brash horns punctuate the upbeat soul-rocker “Stranger,” “Sparkling Path” boasts twitching guitars that are twisted into post-punk contortions, and “Shame Game” is a disco-blues strut driven by funky piano and slippery grooves. The vulnerable “Adrift” is even more stunning: It’s a queasy breakup waltz with plaintive piano, melancholy cello accents, and Bag’s brassy vibrato. As that song demonstrates, Bag’s ability to zero in on (and dissect) emotional, physical, and political turmoil is key to  ’s power. “Invisible” describes a man losing himself to alcohol dependency, while “77,” a churning girl-group punk cyclone bolstered by invective from Kathleen Hanna and Bratmobile’s Allison Wolfe, is an unsparing condemnation of income inequality—specifically, how a woman makes 77 cents to every dollar a man makes: “It’s not right / It’s bad for women / And worse if you’re not white.” ’s moving closing track, “White Justice,” is even more incisive. Bag wrote the song about the 1970 Chicano Moratorium, a peaceful Mexican-American-driven anti-Vietnam War protest turned deadly after police intervention. At the end of the tune, she links this tragedy to the fact that the decades-old “struggle” is still relevant today. “You say justice is colorblind / I know you’re lying,” she sings, before leaning forcefully into the line, “White justice is a travesty.” Despite these somber moments,   ripples with optimism. Of note is the hollering pogo “Turn It Up,” which advises that it’s never too late to shed toxic and dishonest people (if not your own baggage), and start over: “You made a playlist and it’s locked into your head / Toss it out, play something new instead.” On  , Bag asserts that change is necessary—but, perhaps more important, she also believes it’s possible.", "genre": ["Alternative", "punk rock"]}
{"album": "The B​-​Music of Jean Rolli", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "French director Jean Rollin’s cult sexploitation vampire films are a specialist interest. Fans love pop surrealist details like the crotch-sucking vampire bats, incongruous clown costumes, and ubiquitous opera capes. Others are likely to find the slow-motion chases and interminable S&M softcore set pieces a chore to sit through. The soundtracks are a different matter, though. The music is a hip sexadelic mélange, veering with giddy bloodlust from pop lounge to avant dissonance and back again. Pierre Raph’s “Gilda & Gunshots” from  (1973) juxtaposes breathy female gasps with pistol blasts, strutting bass, and hepped-up percussion to create a go-go dance chase scene complete with cheekily orgasmic false starts and stops. Acanthus’s “La Chateau” from   (1971) gets into a Deep Purple-esque heavy rock groove, which dissipates into druggy atmospheric noodling before locking back in. Yvon Gerault’s quasi-Bach riff “Blue Doll Baroque” from  (1970) is a charming toccata and fugue pastiche, with the obligatory fleet final passages juxtaposed with the shuffling of chains. The most striking track, though, is François Tusques’s “Croque Weasel” from   (1968). Tusques was an important French free-jazz pianist, and the most famous composer to work on Rollin’s films. This one-minute track is bracingly abstract, starting with sawing atonal strings, and moving through plucking and piano banging; someone tries to pick up a funk beat but is subsumed by ambient crowd noise. It sounds like a mod party in a graveyard awkwardly collapsing in on itself. Another selection by Tusques, “Golden Panther,” throws an alarm clock into the middle of a Debussy arrangement. Fans of Morricone’s odder experiments will be delighted. The whole album, with its tonal shifts and unexpected stylistic detours, is an appealing evocation of all the fractured and groovy creatures of the night, even if (or maybe especially if) you haven’t ever seen a Rollin film.", "genre": ["Soundtrack"]}

But the fact that   seems to sprawl into infinity is appropriate: this is the kind of music that needs room to breathe. Its six songs don’t play out so much as they  , slouching on slow-motion chord explosions toward gloriously crestfallen climaxes.

In other words, if you’re looking for a quick metal fix, this might not be the album for you. But to pass on   would be to miss out on some of the most majestic music being created today. Glacially-paced and gilded with crystalline melodies, thundering epics like “Whispering Spiritscapes” and “Scripture Of Exaltation and Punishment” seem to emanate from some cavernous pit in the Earth’s molten core. Vocalist/guitarist Damon Good’s spectral moan rumbles like some ominous warning from beyond the grave, and the lead guitars sound as though they’ve been beamed down from the far reaches of the galaxy. The forlorn organ intro of “The Rubaiyat”—a reference to Persian quatrains—gives way to a booming vocal incantation and more of those gorgeous guitars.

Blearier and more crepuscular, “Sunspots V” corrals its movements into a collective, minimalist simmer.

Performers like Tinariwen and Songhoy Blues, from Mali, and Bombino, from Niger, have combined the traditional music of Berber peoples in the Sahara with blues rock influences and amplification to create a unique, immediately recognizable, and hugely appealing hybrid—Jimi Hendrix and Oum Kalthoum blissed out together. The Algerian band Imarhan’s 2016 self-titled debut was a fine example of the form, with track after track of groovy, meditative riffs. Their sophomore effort, though, is a step further. The rock influences have been amped up and combined with a good bit of funk; the result is less trance, more swagger. The first track, “Azzaman” has a shoulder-shrugging, loose-limbed backbeat that you would fit right in on classic rock radio; it climaxes with a guitar solo that leans so heavy on the wah-wah it’s almost self-parodic: ridiculous and glorious at once. “Ehad wa dagh” has a tasty hook and a rhythm section racing along at punk rock speeds without breaking a sweat. “Tumast” has a slinky bottom end, walls of blazing guitar, and a vocal chorus that wouldn’t be out of place in Bollywood pop; it’s an honest-to-god desert dancefloor stomper. “Zinizjumegh” starts as a pretty acoustic number, bluesy in the spirit of folks who love both Robert Johnson and Robert Plant.

The mood is decidedly grimmer on  which, like its predecessor, was recorded and mixed in Sampson’s home studio. Those claustrophobic environs suit  ’s paranoid mood. Opener “Blown Up” rides a tense, krautrock rhythm, and Sampson’s voice is hushed and distant. When the guitars finally enter, one minute into the song, they arrive in great, furious slashes, a far cry from  ’s church-bell pealing. The result is a record that is marvelously tense and coiled; “Psych Slasher” is aptly named, a big, roaring garage rock song that wouldn’t be out of place in the   catalogue. “Choking Sick” heaves and stutters, Sampson repeating the same two-note vocal melody over and over as the drums kick and clatter behind him. “Under the Bed” is draped in funereal synths; “Scenic Route to Nowhere” is a three-minute festival of scuzz and rattle. “Hatred,” with its open arpeggios, is the closest in tone to  , but Sampson sighs out his vocals, undercutting the spiraling guitars with a twinge of melancholy. The album’s title is appropriate—every song feels caked in gluey layers of distortion, but instead of capsizing the record, the bleariness instead makes the record feel drifting and dreamlike. If   was a crisp, hi-res photo of a mountain range on a sunny day,   is that same photo during a rainstorm, with the focus off.

Partnering up for another round with producer Chris Coady, who also produced  , Maine adds another coat of sheen to his songs while also stripping away the heady layers and effects of  The result is a leaner, sleeker body of work. Though the album is satisfyingly varied—moving from brittle ballads like the spectacular “Country” to the left-field “Åkeren,” which is sung in Norwegian—it’s the dance tracks that get the most attention, finessed to flaunt a deep low-end punch framed by elegantly syncopated bass runs. On  Maine further explores his signature themes of melancholy and wanderlust. Anxiety, detachment, and the mechanics of comfort play out obliquely in openers “Leave the House” and “Find Me” (“Touch my neck and walk me home / And I’ll be fine once I’m alone / Just don’t let it find me”). Maine’s lyrics draw heavily on sensory details, and are mostly inward-looking, evoking the feeling of being stuck in one’s own head. The reason   succeeds is because it contrasts these dour lyrical themes with elevating, spirited instrumentals. Throughout, Maine showcases two critical attributes: a dedication to creative growth and, as on his first two albums, prowess when it comes to composing truly gripping melodies. “Now the Water” is an instant New Romantic classic, and “Anymore” is a tranced-out near-reggaeton track, charmingly accented with autotune. These are intelligent and rewarding steps forward for Maine—steps that go even further to assure his place in the modern pop pantheon.", "genre": ["Pop", "dream pop"]}
{"album": "La Contra Ola", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "The curators of  , a new collection of synthwave and post-punk from Spain, present their new compilation with a handy contextual sidebar. Punk rock, they explain, soundtracked much of Spain’s early ’80s, when the country was still emerging as a democracy. But punk was largely commandeered by the record industry and made safe for mass consumption. The country’s true sonic rebels, they explain, were pioneers of electronic music—a few of whom achieved success, most of whom toiled in obscurity. ’s first two tracks set the stage for just how far-flung a compilation this is. Prolific Madrid industrial act Esplendor Geométrico, who self-released and distributed their cassettes in the early ’80s, open things up with “Moscú Está Helado.” It’s a severe dance jam that’s a bit of an anomaly among the group’s early ambient sound experiments—cassettes of which the duo both self-released and distributed to their cult audience. The second track, Zombies’ “Extraños Juegos,” is at the other end of the musical spectrum—a candy-coated, reverb-heavy surf pop tune with robotic drumming and chaotic synth interludes. Unlike Esplendor Geométrico, Zombies signed to RCA and experienced considerable mainstream success in Spain before their untimely disintegration. There are some familiar sounds here: TodoTodo’s “Autogas” is a funky twist on Kraftwerk, while De Picnic’s “Jeanette Me Quiere” and La Fura Dels Baus’ “Mareâ” sound reminiscent of Afrika Bambaataa or Herbie Hancock tracks from around the same era. More often, though, this is music that brims with explosive possibility. Derribos Arias’s “A Flúor,” one of their two excellent contributions, is a particularly gorgeous soundscape that nods at dub, punk, and flamenco. Diseño Corbusier’s tracks are minimal and focused, employing bulbous synths that echo across the full stereo spectrum (it’s easy to see why they’ve been rediscovered and celebrated in recent years). And El Humano Marrano’s “Himno” is a raw and youthful slice of punk energy—it sounds like Domi Delgado jogging in place while he sings—channeled through syncopated blips and bleeps. Many of  ’s artists were using the same new drum machines and synthesizers in their music, but they set off in any number of exciting directions. The comp, released by the fantastic Swiss imprint Bongo Joe, is a fresh and fascinating listen—and lucky for us, the     team describes this release as their “first act.”", "genre": ["Electronic", "synthwave"]}

On her 1980 debut single, her singing lunged through skittering synths, demanding attention almost immediately. Her approach to vocals—practically whispering one moment and then screaming the next—adds even more tension to her already unsettling music. Built from aging drum machines, Moritani builds upon the atmosphere she reared up on last year’s claustrophobic  Her latest album,  , takes this to the extreme. It features nothing but the sound of Moritani’s voice, often layered on top of itself or warped into new forms. In a   shared prior to the album’s release in Japan last November, she said the idea appeared around the time of her first release,  , and lingered over the next 30-plus years. Yet the impetus to finally see if she could “draw a picture by voice” came by the grind of touring, and having to lug heavy equipment with her. “So I asked myself whether I could make music solely with my own body,” Moritani writes. She retreated to a small room in her home with nothing but effects pedals and a headset mic, and created   over the course of three days. The music that emerged from these home sessions boasts some of the most disturbing noises Phew has ever evoked. Opener “Cloudy Day” finds Moritani layering syllables into a drone, which envelopes the song and gives it a persistent sense of worry. “In The Doghouse” turns out to be quite literal, with Moritani barking and whimpering like a canine (one with access to quite the effects rig) before saxophone-like wails rip across the song. But this is Moritani mutating her voice to sound like an instrument, marking  most inspired vocal transformation. While her palate has changed considerably—percussion, usually provided by dusty rhythm boxes, is absent on  , meaning the songs here lean closer to drone music—the same hair-raised-on-neck vibe presents itself on the rumbling “Just A Familiar Face,” featuring spoken word lines through layers of crackling distortion. And, it can even be funny, in a way that would make you nervously chuckle before making sure you haven’t landed in a David Lynch movie. Just check “Cloudy Day,” which builds deliriously to the moment where an un-manipulated Moritani enters to give…a brief weather report. And it’s moments like that on  reminding that, while it’s one of the more extreme projects from an artist long pushing beyond the norm, it’s still within her off-kilter zone.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

Their last LP—the austere  , hand-packed and assembled by the band itself—was released in 2013 after relentless recording and touring. After nearly a decade of going hard, the band needed some time away. The vacation must have done the trick—No Age’s sonic frenzy is more expansive than ever, but it’s also cleanly controlled. From the opener, the revelatory “Cruise Control,”   puts Randy Randall’s layered guitar, coming in thick and resonant, front and center, providing both low, atmospheric distortion and rhythmic buttressing to Dean Spunt’s plodding percussion and yowled vocals. The mood on “Cruise Control” largely foreshadows the tracks that follow. While No Age never forgo their ambient, effect-soaked interludes (see the title track),   is truly defined by adrenaline.

On  , Segall’s expansive, deeply ambitious record, the multi-instrumentalist crystallizes a career’s worth of musical reference points into an altogether fresh pop-rock statement. For his latest, Segall turns more than ever to rock’s R&B origins, including plenty of horns, electric piano, and expanded percussion with hand drums and programmed drum beats. Ranging from expansive instrumental jams to quaint solo piano ballads,   manages to somehow free itself from the burden of its own influences by merging styles like grunge, disco, punk, funk, prog rock, and rootsy folk without turning such pop open-mindedness into tangled bombast. In Segall’s world, the funk strut of “Despoiler Of Cadaver” and the reverent cover of Hot Chocolate’s soulful “Every 1’s A Winner” fit neatly alongside an early ’70s folk rock weeper like “Cry Cry Cry” or the fuzzed-out blues exploration of “Shoot You Up.” Segall remains an old-fashioned maximalist, and although he’s gone the double-album route before (see 2014’s sprawling  never before has he so fully relished his role as pop history tour guide.

{"album": "All These Worlds Are Yours", "artist": "HOLY", "description": "The second full-length by Swedish artist Hannes Ferm (and one of the newest releases on Stockholm’s   PNKSLM label), HOLY’s   gets its name from a cryptic message left by aliens to humanity in Arthur C. Clarke’s  , which likely explains why one song is called “ৌ alien life??” (yes, that   the title). It’s an album of juxtapositions; Ferm describes   as “reflections on nighttime and dreams,” combined with ‘70s art-glam majesty. He certainly doesn’t hide the latter; opening track “Night on Earth” has the kind of spiraling-downward flow on both piano and guitar that Julian Cope once called “the glam descend,” something majestic but crumbling at the same time. Ferm’s key aesthetic trick is putting everything through shuddering layers of reverb that sound like extensions of Dave Fridmann’s production work at the turn of the millennium—think: the Flaming Lips’  , or Mercury Rev post- . Combined with its generally hazy sonics, much of  sounds like a cassette tape that’s been left out in the sun too long. The results aren’t lo-fi, but they’re far from crisp and clean; the strings on “Dreaming Still?” are precise, even when they’re swimming through clouds of appealing musical murk. Ferm’s elfin vocals, sometimes overdubbed in layers, soar around the bubbling arrangements on multi-part compositions like “premonition / ◯ / it shines through.” The title track which, at almost nine minutes, is the album’s longest number, is beautifully anthemic, Ferm combining stirring fanfares with lovely piano-led passages, and singing over the latter dreamily. Sometimes, his music’s enough in its own right; the stately sweep of “Heard Her” calls to mind the prime late-’90s Elephant 6 collective’s own psychedelic orchestrations, with just enough sonic muddiness to give it appealing grit.", "genre": ["Alternative", "shoegaze"]}
{"album": "ION", "artist": "Portal", "description": "On their previous album, 2013’s   the cultish Australian band Portal offered a decidedly contemporary take on death metal. Although  , the band’s latest and fifth full-length album, retains its predecessor’s unorthodoxy, it also derives seething energy from looking backward. On  , Portal trade  ’s richness for a messier, DIY sound that recalls early death metal groups like   and  , who, in their infancy, kept their compositions comparatively simple and their production lo-fi. Never imitative, though, Portal access the foundational simplicity of their forebears in order to, across  ’s tight 37 minutes, articulate a distinct language steeped in their own mythology. ’s nine tracks lack defined structures—they’re distorted, abrupt, and sometimes entirely without melody. Following a two-minute ambient intro, tracks two and three—“ESP ION AGE” and “Husk”—flit between death metal tropes and fuzzy atmospherics, with Portal using new compositional ideas almost algorithmically, as if reprogramming the genre from its source code. Throughout  , vocalist The Curator emits monotonic growls atop recharging musical backdrops; guitars saw through the mix, ascending and descending at hardcore speeds without stopping on recognizable riffs. “Phreqs” exacerbates  ’s relationship with time: Progressing chaotically yet with an ineffable logic, the song slips out of reach in its second half. The mythology that complements Portal’s idiosyncratic musical language is called the “Olde Guarde,” also the title of  ’s nearly 10-minute closer. About halfway through, the song’s metallic churn is replaced by a  -like mix of phonograph crackles, cinematic hums, and wordless, tuneful moaning. Breaking with their own template, Portal offer a perplexing but decidedly human capstone—a living voice making its way through an electric musical landscape. The Olde Guarde employs elemental language (“ions,” “volts,” “spores”) and looks to first-generation technology; on  , this pseudoscientific language connects to an originary death metal spirit in service of something both abstract and alive.", "genre": ["Metal", "Death Metal"]}
{"album": "ucina Pover", "artist": "Album of the Day", "description": "—the artistic alias of Finnish born, Glasgow-based musician Maria Rossi—is a phrase taken from the austere cooking methods of the peasants in southern Italian regions after World War II. While the culinary style was, at the time, an ingenious (and somewhat desperate) adaptation to the harsh economic conditions in Europe at the time, Rossi has taken it more as a philosophical inspiration. Her ethos is doing more with less, eschewing the use of the fancy equipment normally associated with experimental electronic music production and instead creating compositions out of simple elements: found sounds she records in her home, and on walks around the Scottish metropolis; minimalist synths, sparse percussion, and layered harmonies she creates with her own voice. The results are ethereal, meditative and, upon closer listens, slightly spiritual.  In that way,  Cucina Povera’s debut album, is a powerful study in limits. By using a deliberately restricted sonic palette, she directs the listener towards the beauty, the sadness, and the surprise that can be found in the most mundane details. The opener, “Demetra,” is built around two looped samples: one of Rossi hissing into a microphone and another of her harmonizing with herself. She shrouds these elements in reverb and complements them with a crescendo synth line that eventually fades into—like most of her compositions—silence. The follow-up track, “Kuparirumpu,” features a solo-choir with three distinct melodies that seem to expand and contract throughout the song, all of them in a tense competition with Rossi’s vocalizations. She follows this path—building around natural elements—throughout most of  using the spellbinding effects of chants and repetition to paint a picture of bucolic simplicity and strange, fraught beauty. Throughout the album, Rossi takes advantage of the possibilities of darkness and the heavier aspects of minimal electronic music. “Avainsana” is a mind-bending trip, where she lures the listener in with a haunting, low-end synth line and a looped sample of what sounds like water leaking into a metal sink. Her voice then clears the way for a techno kick drum, which falls by the wayside just before the song ends. “Totean,” the album closer, is an outlier, resting primarily on low-frequency oscillators and ending with Rossi sporadically speaking. With  Rossi seems to want us to follow her into a game of possibilities, where even the smallest sounds can nourish the soul, if only we’d let them.", "genre": ["Electronic", "avant-garde"]}

Despite Hunter’s U.K. origins,   boldly underlines the fact that he’s as steeped in deep soul as any Yank. When 55-year-old Hunter lets his lived-in but surprisingly pliable pipes loose on his seventh solo album, the ghosts of Sam Cooke and Ray Charles surely smile down approvingly. When his band coils itself tightly around sensual mid-tempo hip-wigglers like “I Don’t Wanna Be Without You” and “Whatever It Takes,” they recall the stylishly syncopated, urbane feel of early ’60s R&B slingers like Doris Troy and Barbara Lewis. Hunter’s more than a devilishly deft vocalist—his guitar licks pack enough sting to keep the tracks spry and smoldering. His six-string prowess is most apparent on the aptly-titled instrumental “Blisters,” where he lets fly a torrent of fiercely visceral, bluesy lines over smoldering, Booker T.-style organ riffs. But lean in for the ending of “Don’t Let Pride Take You For a Ride,” where Hunter unspools a savage stream of riffs as feral as his closing vocal wails.

Slow builds that never culminate in any sort of climax appear and disappear throughout this ambient project. Naqvi isn’t afraid of the pregnant pause; “Sputnik” begins with a long sustained synth chord until it rests, uncomfortably, and then begins again. The glorious larghissimo of “Mannequin” builds patiently, unafraid to leave long near-silences between its otherworldly glissandos.

Initially arriving on the wings of Chicago house’s first wave in the mid ‘80s and forging a stylistic prototype for the sound with the trio Phuture, DJ Pierre delivered the screeching, squelching bass synth that was the signature of 1987’s “Acid Tracks.” Pierre hasn’t let up since then, and the 16-track   is a welcome sliver of high points culled from productions dating from the early ‘90s to the present.  opens with a conservative rework of “House for All,” an obscurity originally produced in 1993 by Baltimore’s Blunted Dummies.

The track begins with a lone, fierce kick drum, slowly incorporating a warbling bass synthesizer, minimal piano chords, and a booming chorus sung by Ann Nesby. Tethering the sonics are astutely layered sound bites from Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Stride Toward Freedom” speech. By looping King’s instruction to “meet physical force with soul force,” DJ Pierre channels the foundational hope and virtue of house music’s classic era.

The Tuareg people are nomads who live throughout the Sahara; musically, they are known for their rural folk guitar as well as tende, a style of communal music that is also the name of the goatskin-covered drum used to create it. Tende is traditionally performed by young women, while the region’s guitar music is the bastion of men. Guitar, however, is a comparatively new addition, having entered Tuareg tradition in the ‘70s when young men living in exile in Libya and Algeria discovered the instrument and eventually brought it back to the villages with them. Les Filles de Illighadad is an all-female Tuareg group and   is this particular configuration’s first album; Ghali herself is one of only two female guitarists in Niger. On the album’s opener and title track “Eghass Malan,” the intermingling voices (which at times incorporate yodeling) summon the vibrant, celebratory spirit of a live tende performance. Handclaps, also crucial to tende, are prominent throughout the album, an additional form of percussion that complements the swells of desert guitar. By merging the timeless tradition of tende with the sonic possibilities of guitar, the music of Les Filles de Illighadad make a striking generational leap from the ancestral sounds of their rural community.

In years past, he would’ve only relied on gritty boom-bap to present himself. But on this song, with its blaring trumpet loop and dark piano chords, Ave reminds us that, above all else, we’re all victims of societal conditioning: “Neo-Nazis marchin’ in Stockholm again though / Half of those fools caught in the Stockholm Syndrome / I ain’t making no excuses for a Nazi or defending them, but / I still ain’t seen a newborn with an emblem on.” As an artist known for his subtlety,   might be Ave’s strongest statement to date.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "underground hip hop"]}

Despite the fact that most of the songs stick to a pre-punk pacing, rarely exceeding mid ’60s California bop, the record’s modern fidelity helps it sidestep the “retro” tag, and Troper’s diatribes about the elite contain too much millennial sarcasm to be confused with the gripes of an earlier era. Throughout   Troper finds his sweet spot when he’s yanking from both generations simultaneously. “Your Brand” and “Big School” are the standouts, melding Phil Spector-esque majesty with Jeff Rosenstock-ish witticisms like, “Turn a tragedy into something you can work with” and “Pay to have someone reassure you that you’re smart.” Although Troper’s limited vocal range and lack of stylistic variation make for a slightly tiresome middle patch, changeups like the squeaky a cappella “Wedding” and the pulsating crunch of “Wicked” are smartly sequenced, revitalizing the listener before  ’s stellar back end.

Halved not just by physical format but by two crystalline synth baubles (“Pool Cleaner” and “Pool Cleaner II”), this is a beast of an album that was built carefully and intentionally. A long shadow lies across the band’s sound here, as if it was drafted with charcoal; there’s always been the slightest chilly goth touch to HEBV’s songs, and on  it’s just slightly exaggerated—though not so far as to lose the group’s essence. The riffs on “Jaws” and “The Wizz” gleam with the same chrome as mid-’80s Killing Joke, but even those poppiest of tracks are still folded under distorted haze. The magnificent “Scum Rat” has enough scrambled solos and woozy discordancy to make its eventual fall off a precipice (the whole last minute of the song is deeply damaged dark psychedelic noise) feel like its logical conclusion, and the 12-minute “Onieut,” which closes out  , vamps on the odd beauty at the heart of that sort of wildness. Playful but powerful,   is the most expertly controlled chaos.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Loss Memory", "artist": "Coma Cinema", "description": "Coma Cinema’s music has always been bleak. Themes of heartbreak, addiction, loneliness, abuse, and the inevitability of death have comprised the bulk of the group’s subject matter and, on what songwriter Mathew Lee Cothran is calling the fifth and final album under this moniker, he approaches these topics with a newfound clarity. The reclusive North Carolinian, who’s most commonly recognized as one-half of the group Elvis Depressedly, rarely does interviews, but he frequently offers intimate personal details to anonymous fans on the Q&A website  . According to a number of his responses, he’s been sober for the last year or so, and  is a document of him reconciling with his troubled history. Although Cothran’s previous records—namely his 2011 breakthrough  and 2013’s  —were exceptionally grim, his narratives were shrouded in what sometimes felt like self-defensive allegory, as if poetic language was something he used to protect himself from his darkest thoughts. He drops much of that approach on  , offering his most direct lyrics to date. “Tether” outlines in sparse language the agonizing details of the trauma he endured as the child of violent addicts—and the rejection that enabled his own addictions. “Burden” uses the oddly pretty form of a folk rock song to explore the cyclical nature of destruction, featuring the hook, “My mom had a fucked up childhood / That’s the burden that we both bear.” “Window” is a painful look back at Cothran’s recent past, as he recalls the darkest periods of his alcoholism, living in squalor, and the room he used to fearfully hide in as a child with his mother. Songs like these feel, as the title implies, like Cothran is finally confronting memories he spent suppressing. The record doesn’t come anywhere near a conclusion or an understanding, but there are glimmers of hope that Cothran is at least coming close to forgiving himself (“Thunder”) and accepting that his life has value (“Running Wide Open”). Ultimately, though,  is about isolation: the isolation of addiction, the isolation of regret, the isolation of sobriety, and the isolation of memory. This is the first time in the project’s near decade-long career that Cothran’s been able to recognize the places those different forms of isolation intersect, and finally arriving at the notion that healing is possible.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}

As the weird little song fades, heavily-treated voices in the background repeat, “Call for pizza. Call for pizza.” In a lesser songwriter’s hands, this could come across as preachy. Yet Davis isn’t merely yelling, “Wake up, sheeple!” He’s putting forward the facts as he sees them. In “Stock Up All the Prisons,” which bears all the rhythmic pulse and infectious melody of an orchestrated Liars tune, Davis goes step-by-step into the way the American prison-industrial complex functions. “It’s good to be in an office  / Let’s take a look and see / How me and my friends / Can loot the treasury,” he sings, then connects America’s for-profit health care with its for-profit prison industry. “Stock up all the prisons / Lock hospital doors.”", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock", "indie pop"]}
{"album": "Nothing Valley", "artist": "Melkbelly", "description": "Melkbelly’s  opens with a ripper. “Off the Lot,” the lead track from the Chicago quartet’s first full-length, is a two-and-a-half minute long burst of raw energy, full of distorted guitar, pummeling drums, and vocals that accelerate from an urgent sing-song to an earth-scorching scream. It’s a taut, brutalizing beginning, and one that quickly encapsulates Melkbelly’s specific brand of intense, tightly-knit rock ‘n’ roll. If  feels instinctual, it’s for good reason. Prior to forming in 2013, all four of Melkbelly’s players had been collaborating in some form within Chicago’s DIY scene. They’re also all practically (or actually) family: vocalist/guitarist Miranda Winters is married to guitarist Bart Winters, his brother Liam Winters plays bass, and drummer James Wetzel is a longtime friend. Separately, their lists of influences and past projects run the gamut from folk-pop to punk to experimental noise. And together, they create a perfectly choreographed push and pull of twisting rhythms, anxious harmonies, and thrashing dissonance. Built on the foundation laid by their 2014  EP,   goes harder and louder. It also captures the awesome physicality of Melkbelly’s sweat-drenched live shows. Like on “Twin Lookin Motherfucker,” where Wetzel’s drumming switches between metallic beats and breakneck fills, and Miranda’s sneering-but-sweet vocals play tug of war with Bart’s fuzz-addled guitar. “Kid Kreative” finds Miranda spitting snide lyrics about getting style-jacked by a male musician, her voice gamely fighting for top billing over a rising tide of percussion. Even in the quieter moments, Melkbelly seems to thrive on sonic tension. On “Cawthra,” trembling bass parts and whispered lines about being blindfolded and “forced to stay out late” clash with bombastic choruses of mincing guitar noise. The band has said that   was inspired, at least in part, by touring around the West Coast. But in place of the wide-eyed wistfulness that usually comes with the territory, they’ve turned the tour-as-muse trope into an album full of careening stop-starts and palpable nervous energy. In other words, it’s the true sound of a sitting shoulder-to-shoulder on a too-long drive with all of the ones you love. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}

Since his 2014 breakthrough,  , the music James Whipple makes as M.E.S.H. has explored both the functional needs of the club and the expressive power of abstraction, challenging assumptions about dual premises that are often viewed as an either-or proposition.

That’s apparent from the first track, “Nemorum Incola,” which lives up to its title (Latin for “the inhabitants of forests”), mixing bird calls and machine hum as if a mecha is exploring the jungle in three dimensions. The mecha cuts back the brush to reveal “Mimic,” a layered composition that sees a three-note melody mutate to rhythm of organic hand drums and a fractured two-step shuffle before everything falls apart. That creation and destruction is apparent throughout the album, as individual tracks serve as self-contained experiments in juxtaposition, whether it’s the polyrhythmic battle of “2 Loop Trip” or the chainsaw synths and robotic call and response of “Search. Reveal.” Yet the experimental flourishes do not undermine the propulsive drive of the album: “Coercer” is noisy techno hypnosis, “Diana Triplex” is seductive with something lurking beneath the groove, and “Signal Ride Drum” moves through space like a rollercoaster inside a drum machine. The ride eventually ends, with the gorgeous, Baroque chords of “Ihnaemiauimx.” Not only does it call back  ’s beatless “Jester’s Visage,” but it closes the album on a somber, meditative note as we leave this lush—and fully constructed—world M.E.S.H. has created.", "genre": ["Electronic", "soundscapes"]}

With their punk band Worriers, Denitzio has created  , a new record that, above all else, is a utility to explore, affirm, and celebrate the changing experiences of queer identities over time. In a statement about the record, they explained, “I wrote the majority of the songs on this record thinking about what past versions of myself would’ve needed.” The album works through Denitzio’s past while reconciling it in the context of their present. “Future Me” is an affectionate note to their younger self, cataloguing the resonant traumas that contribute to their present. “I relive those years like phantom limbs,” Denitzio sings over crashing  -like guitars and fierce drums. On opener “My 85th Rodeo,” they’re sardonic in their takedown of pain: “Laugh when I hate everything!” The result of all of this is a record that’s an empathetic, representative resource for coping with trauma, identity, and change that both troubles and clarifies those two things. Most records can be contorted into personal applicability, no matter how distant they are to our reality, but Denitzio has written a sort of punk rock template with the express purpose of speaking to queer experiences.

Diron wears oversized dark glasses, a black leather motorcycle jacket, and sports an enormous Afro as he boogies, jerks, and clambers over monkey bars as the infectious beat jiggles and thumps and a sax sample cycles through. “Let me see you dance!” he declares, as attractively muscled individuals of all genders bounce on trampolines, lift weights, and pose in front of mirrors. It’s sexy, eclectic, ecstatic music for freaky goofballs of every persuasion. Indeed, the title  , suggesting isolation and contemplation, is a singularly poor fit for the actual contents—though the image of Diron in full-body jumpsuit with multi-colored patches and space-age attachments is on the mark. Hailing from Angola, the singer and instrumentalist is now based in Portugal, but his music draws from everything—hip-hop, rock, disco, electronic dance music, and the Angolan dance music Kuduro. “Kema,” the album opener, starts with a sinuous melody and slides into grooving polyrhythms with electronic laser noises, with Diron and the background singers doing a call and response mixing Portuguese and Kimbundu. “Ghetto Ghetto” sounds like a somber or angry title, but there’s nothing downbeat about the track itself, with its shake-your-butt beat and Diron shouting “Ghetto! Ghetto!” in a crazed chipmunk voice, until the syllables are lost in a frantic stuttering repetition of the hard “g” sound. Other than “Don’t Stop,” the high point of the album is probably “NCrazy,” which features South African rapper Spoek Mathambo. The popping electro bass would be right at home in the early ’80s, and Mathambo spills syllables over it like a man spitting supercharged ping pong balls. “Tell me tell me tell me what the ratio / Of good time to bad / Baby, let me know!” For Diron Animal, joy bumps sadness off the dancefloor every time.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"]}

The bands featured mostly tend toward the rock end of the spectrum, but even within that broad umbrella there is a universe of gradation. “Sage,” by The Murlocs, is a gritty, bluesy stomper, squawking guitars and greasy, back-porch harmonica smashing into loose-limbed percussion.

Total Giovanni pull off a kind of pop-rock disco on the revved-up Sam Weston remix of “Your Light.” Everything is sugared-up and jittery, rubberband bassline stretching and snapping over a firecracker rhythm.

The Canadian band—featuring nine members, one of whom’s sole job is handling film projections at their live shows—have made a career out of mystery, shrouding any sort of personality beneath layers of post-rock haze and climactic melodic builds. The group, led by Efrim Menuck, have focused their identity on a lack of individual characters. This is a collective in the strictest sense of the word. Every moment is key, every player essential.

The delicate shriek of bagpipes enter the fold, at first beautiful and pastoral, before effortlessly shifting to something more eerie, discordant, and noisy.   is full of such moments. It’s an extremely uncomfortable album, constantly shifting and playing with expectations of the ways we expect post-rock songs to move. The album centers around “Bosses Hang” and “Anthem for No State,” each of which features three separate tracks. The latter is the album’s standout, a 13-minute scorcher that moves from delicate, contemplative isolation to full-band fireworks during its third part. “Anthem for No State, Pt.

Every word is murmured and echoing. “Sometimes pain brings us back to where we gotta be,” Pfaff concludes. As is often the case on  , the specifics are left to the imagination. All we really hear about is the aftermath, the wounds that won’t close. Pfaff’s intimate lyrics are frequently numbed by their semi-detached vocal delivery, sounding not so much weary as steadfast.

Like “Seeing It,” a woozy, guitar-heavy jam about the blurring experience of being “stuck in your own body.” Or “Blame,” which pairs sticky drums and soaring guitar hooks with lines like, “I wonder if sometimes you think / That you’ve created a monster / A bitch you can’t even blame / I swear to god I feel like her.” On “Either Way,” guitarist Clayton Parker summons the ‘90s pop-punk greats, while Bognanno rips through lines about love, lust, and greed with a heady mix of confidence and abandon. Taken all together,   becomes a soundtrack not for feeling down, but for pulling yourself up off the floor, confronting your sadness, and turning it into something constructive and healing. And in that way, it couldn’t have come at a better time. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}
{"album": "Rainbow Edition", "artist": "Hype Williams", "description": "Being a fan of the art-pop group Hype Williams has always meant just rolling with whatever absurdity—musical or otherwise—they saw fit to deliver. The elusive duo has always been allegedly made up of provocative singer-songwriter Dean Blunt and enigmatic Russian artist Inga Copeland. Their myth goes like this: they’ve been working together since 2005 and began releasing projects in 2009 including the 2011-released compilation  . Two years later, the duo split. New music released under the Hype Williams moniker began to surface again in the middle of 2016, but everything since   has now been dubbed as frauds by Ninja Tune imprint Big Dada, who will release  , the supposedly first true Hype Williams album since  . Blunt and Copeland are, according to the label, still out, but the new forward-facing members Slaughter and Silvermane have brought the same brand of ecstatic lo-fi concoctions any original fan will recognize as true to Hype Williams form. Self-described as “strictly for the whip,”   is brimming with blissed-out, weedy beats. Many of them, like standouts “Puredamage” and “Smokebox,” clock in at less than a minute, but still make an impression; the former is 30 seconds of glassy electronics and tripping, detuned guitar; the latter features a rubbery bassline bouncing beneath mirage-like synths. The album’s brevity—maintained almost throughout except for the six-minute ethereal meditation “Spinderella’s Dream”—makes way for its mysteries. You can spelunk for the origins its samples (like the relationship advice call-in show clip on “Ask Yee”) and other references, ad nauseam. With so many tracks packed into 37 minutes, there is a lot to discover under the static. The best and most meta moment on the album comes is a crackling track called “This is Mister Bigg. How You Doing Mister Bigg,” which is full of ominous synths, creeping, doomy percussion and a keyboard line that sounds like it was plucked from a John Carpenter score. Its title is a reference to the cinematic remix of R&B singer Kelly Price’s 1998 breakout single “Friend of Mine.” That song featured vocals from R. Kelly and the icon Ronald Isley, who duet in proto-“Trapped in the Closet” fashion. Its video was created by acclaimed music video director and group namesake, Hype Williams. The group could have referenced Williams in a host of more obvious ways, tipping their hat to, say, Missy Elliott’s breakthrough video for “The Rain,” or the sensual cyberpunk world of Busta Rhymes’s “What’s It Gonna Be.” Instead, they went with an odd lyric, cherry-picked from a song that was never a crossover hit. It’s just the kind of maverick ornament that’s become expected of Hype Williams—whoever they may be. —", "genre": ["Experimental", "underground hip hop"]}

From this foundation springs  , Shabason’s first solo LP comprised of nine intimately delivered ambient jazz meditations. Jazz skeptics may already be eyeing the exits, but   is the kind of record that converts the unconvinced. Shabason’s contribution to the lively world of contemporary jazz is full of warmth and invitation; there are subdued chordal constructions from looping saxophone, airy synth layers, and sharp electric guitar crackle. A few traditional percussive elements bubble to the surface as well, like the scattered metronomic clicks on “Neil McCauley,” panning snare brushes on “Long Swim” and the ecstatic rumbles and cymbals on “Belching Smoke.” Though the music on  is experimental, Shabason’s take on the avant-garde is still firmly connected to pop; breathy saxophone lines coo in conversation with stocky synth chord progressions. Shabason has a sensitive, sophisticated ear for tonal development, suggesting a more ethereal Bill Evans, a more terrestrial Brian Eno, a less turbulent  , a contemporary to  ’s EVI invocations and a direct descendant of Donald Byrd’s transcendent   sessions. Shabason is cautious but deliberate with his application of vintage effects, and the results are reminiscent of a late 20th century film score or TV theme. Appropriately, the third track, “Neil McCauley,” is named for Robert DeNiro’s character from Michael Mann’s 1995 film , and there are more than a few sonic nods to Jan Hammer’s glossy   soundtrack. Throughout, Shabason’s debut remains charming. It’s cohesive in tone while drawing on a delightful suite of influences—perhaps enough to even shift a few skeptics.", "genre": ["Jazz", "modern jazz"]}

Rankin is sharp and firm, even in self-doubt: “Meditate, play solitaire, take up self-defense,” she lists, breezily filling voids in a post-breakup limbo. While   plays as a breakup record of sorts, it takes a different approach than the traditional externalization of grief and regret. Instead, Rankin seems determined to keep her focus turned inward, poking and prodding at her own experiences. The result is a record of abstracted fragments from a state of isolation, shaded by sporadic interactions, fleeting friendships, and gorgeous, gauzy guitar tones. “Your Type” details an inebriated romp through Paris, while “Lollipop (Ode to Jim)” recalls an encounter with Jesus and Mary Chain’s Jim Reid, replete with LSD and a chorus hook that rivals the addictive simplicity of “Archie, Marry Me,” from the band’s self-titled debut. Alvvays especially shine when they match disquieted, dreary subject matter with bright instruments and carefree pop melodicism. On the closer “Forget About Life,” Alvvays bathe in the artificial glow of “condominium signs” as an invitation, a hint at a redemptive chance, a product of Rankin’s laborious journey of introspection and self-care; on   she and Alvvays have earned their moment of optimism.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"]}

After the opaque nocturnal allure of their earlier recordings, the New York City-based duo of Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion have come out of the dark, drenching their sharp pop songs in a warm, sumptuous glow that makes them more approachable and welcoming. While  draws on many of the same influences as its predecessors—namely, girl groups of the 1960s, like the Shangri-Las and the Ronettes, as well as chillwave artists like Toro y Moi and occasionally, the airy minimalism of the xx—here, they feel more lived-in. “I Took Your Picture,” for instance, contains echoes of Tame Impala’s kaleidoscopic psych rock, but delivers a human warmth and directness that the former lacks. Later, the thudding piano figures in “Recovery” blur the line between acoustic and electronic instrumentation to captivating effect. While the song’s narratives aren’t necessarily overflowing with giddiness or optimism, there is a newfound confidence and self-awareness in Follin’s lyrics that melds seamlessly with the songs’ colorful arrangements. The album begins with an intention to live in the present moment—“Know I can’t see it all yet / But it’s so real to me”—and then echoes that sentiment throughout; “Our time is nothing now / It slips through our fingers,” Follin sings later on “I Took Your Picture.” Keeping the forces of time and doubt at bay is never an easy task, she seems to be saying, but it’s worth the battle. Sometimes all you can do is make an offering, and make it as exquisite as possible. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}
{"album": "S/T", "artist": "Rainer Maria", "description": "In the early days, Rainer Maria was a band of shouters. The crashing drums, the thunderous guitar, the serpentine bass—the trio created a mountain of sound that, it seemed, could only be scaled by Caithlin DeMarrais and Kaia Fischer screaming their heads off. It was glorious and youthful, but it was also unsustainable. By the time the band moved from Madison to Brooklyn in the late ’90s, they were already looking for ways to pretty up their sound, lest DeMarrais lose more and more shows to shredded vocals cords. “Pretty” was something Rainer Maria aspired to anyway, of course; the increasingly softening force of the music left room for soft thoughts and complicated emotional revelations. The band that, on its first album, had belted out the most emo line of all time—“Call an ambulance, I don’t want to walk home alone” on the track “Tinfoil”—was now summoning mature and peculiar moments of grace. , released in 2006, was instantly appealing and the band’s best attempt at balancing the musical id with the lyrical superego. Song after song predicted the end of the world. On the heavier tracks (“Life of Leisure” and “Catastrophe,” in particular), they put their sweetest thoughts on asteroids and let them burn up, sometimes with explosive results. And then there were the gentler songs, like “Terrified,” which DeMarrais sang with awesome bewilderment and fragility: “On these old streets, I can’t believe you’re not walking next to me / I can almost feel your hand in my back pocket.” By then, she’d long become the lead singer. Fischer was best making her presence felt with moody, muscular guitarwork that provided endless opportunities for the band to go nuts in exhilarating ways. Having achieved the kind of underappreciated perfection that mostly leaves you gasping for air in hot basement shows, the band called it quits later that year. A return did not seem inevitable, but it came, first with reunion shows and now with  , a comeback album that makes progress on all the things this restless band has always done well. Self-titled albums are handy for bands looking to make a statement, that statement usually being, “Here we are.” Rainer Maria already dropped an album called   a long time ago, so this one’s called , and it’s a statement by a band reborn—“here we are  .” A lot has happened in the 11 years since  . DeMarrais released two complicatedly pretty solo records and started a family. Fischer studied Tibetan Buddhism and came out as transgender. Drummer Bill Kuehn traveled the world, studying music and living in Syria and Yemen, among other places. Produced by Kuehn,   is Rainer Maria at their brightest. The songs bubble with nervous energy. Many are loud. Several are joyous, in a we’re-still-alive kinda way. Bolstered by Fischer, DeMarrais’s voice finds new depth, and comes closer to shouting than it has in a long time. This band is fired up. “Let the rest of the world be coarse / You stay sweet for me,” DeMarrais implores on the blazing and catchy “Suicides and Lazy Eyes.” That song leads directly into “Lower Worlds,” an artful and unexpectedly groovy rocker bolstered by Fischer’s fierce backup vocals. “Communicator” is fun and ferocious, shot through with rocketing punk energy. If there’s any of that that old apocalyptic angst left, it’s turned inward. On opener “Broke Open Love,” crashing cymbals and heavy guitar dissipate for a hopeless refrain—“I know, I know, I’m fucking up / I don’t want to fuck up”—then return with a vengeance. DeMarrais’s bass never stops careening and coiling. “I’ll never be alone if I can help it / Talkin’ to the flowers just to have a friend,” she sings on “Forest Mattress,” one of several songs that reference the natural world as a place of mystery and refuge. The slow and spooky “Hellbore” swoons with softly spoken words and long, angular chords, recalling the shadowy beauty of Mazzy Star. The hellbore, by the way, is an oddball in the arboreal world: It’s pretty and it’s poisonous, and it blooms in winter. A fitting metaphor for a band made both prettier and more ferocious by its own remarkable evolutionary journey. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}

Anderson, who goes by  , within a political framework: it’s about an America that moves through suburban basements and conspiracy-theory message boards. But EMA began working on her album over three years ago and devotes it to something more cryptic and timeless: a place she calls the Outer Ring. Occupied by 24-hour Walmarts and generic apartment complexes, the Outer Ring is EMA’s version of the metaphysical layer separating rural expanse from urban density, which she sketches with jagged feedback and gut punch-heavy beats across  ’s 11 disorienting tracks. It’s a place she began exploring with her much-celebrated, defunct noise trio Gowns, and here she draws on thematic highlights from their sole album,  . On “Breathalyzer” and “Always Bleeds,” drones build and burn, anxious and spacious, to cacophony that feels like a rite of purification; on “Blood and Chalk,” the tender, melancholy lyrics and rhythmic repetition evoke  ’s wrenching closer, “Cherylee.” Since going solo in 2011, she’s also truly refined her own unique derivation of rock;   revels in power chords that add heft and grit to all the synths and feedback. Her confrontational refrain of “Tell me stories of famous men / I can’t see myself in them” on “Aryan Nation,” snarled over stadium-echo drums in between guitar solos, would be anthemic if it weren’t so disquieting.

Tupac’s ghost rattles beneath the wallpaper on “inbloom;” a bossa-tinged Minnie Riperton loop is given lively caged-bird disorientation on “dayspass//time2think;” a drunken Teddy Ruxpin dreams of airships on his deathbed on “sleepyhead.” If there’s any nostalgia on  , it’s a curdled variety; sweep that away and you’re left with an album that thrives on the idea that ruins make for a good place to grow roots. —", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "vaporwave", "beat tape"]}

The whole is a kind of flattened cross between Paul McCartney and Raymond Scott, a mildly stoned Bugs Bunny taking Sgt.

On “Boutique Joy,” a single female voice sings slowly while the beat thumps and plods, occasionally stuttering like a dropped coin coming to rest; it’s some sort of unholy fusion between doom metal and elevator music. “Seiko 4” speeds things up again, with repetitive tinkling slowly overwhelmed by horn-like lyricism. “Bridgestone 5” is a distorted, painful waltz.   treats the crass, bland soullessness of capitalism with such invention that you can’t help but be seduced into raptures, giggles, or both.", "genre": ["Soundtrack"]}

{"album": "Utopioid", "artist": "Rosetta", "description": "Post-metal is often described in terms of its unyielding bleakness. The genre has long been defined by its extended passages of droning guitars, its anguished vocal roars, moments of melancholic ambience, and a commitment to experimentation and avant-garde practices over rival metal subgenres’ dalliances with “fun” (ie spandex, solos, and carefree headbanging). From Isis’   to Aidan Baker’s  , post-metal also has an eerie obsession with succumbing to the deadly lure of the sea. In certain ways, Philadelphia’s   plough a similar furrow. Their sixth album boasts funereal tempos and sombre soundscapes galore. Pain and frustration is vented through guttural growling paired with riffs the size of Mount Etna. Obligatory lyrical references to being cast adrift and sinking downwards are present and correct. Yet there is something weirdly life-affirming about this quintet’s sound that separates them from the majority of their post-metal brethren, and with each subsequent Rosetta release this vague sense of defiant optimism has floated closer to the dark surface. It can be detected in the melodic nature of this record’s softer vocal parts as well as in the often shimmering, twinkling nature of Rosetta’s lead guitar patterns which are, dare we say it, almost U2-ish in their ability to raise one’s spirits. It’s present too in Rosetta’s deployment of the kind of rapturous instrumental crescendos that will compel fans of Godspeed You! Black Emperor or Explosions In The Sky to start speaking in tongues. Elsewhere,   draws on the inherent playfulness of prog rock and, as you’d expect from a group who’ve labelled their style as “metal for astronauts,” the record boasts plenty of cosmic textures.

At first glance, it seems like the content is pure levity; paired with arena-sized rock-riff grandiosity, it might read as a clever repositioning of rock ‘n’ roll’s traditional self-importance and insufferable cis-het hypermasculinity.

Here, Exile’s keys, a muffled drum, and electric guitar give the song a folkish backdrop, a contrast to the project’s hyperactive single—“Brick Body Complex”—where Eagle raps from the perspective of the final building to be torn down over rattling percussion. “95 Radios” is a soothing homage to golden age hip-hop airwaves that loosely ties into the album’s greater narrative, as Eagle and the song’s producer Has-Lo reflect on how their affinity for the likes of Q-Tip and De La Soul became a refuge from their harsh surroundings. On “Daydreaming In The Projects” Eagle extols the ability of youth to transcend its circumstances (over an arrangement that pays mild homage to video game composer Koji Kondo).

On   (“The Deaf Ears” in French), Megarbane’s latest album as Cosmic Analog Ensemble, the composer opts for cinematic 1970s funk and soul, the type you’d hear in a spaghetti western or Quentin Tarantino flick. Using electric and acoustic guitars, flutes, and clavinet (among many other instruments), Megarbane builds a lush, beautifully constructed suite—incredibly haunting and robust, nodding to the orchestral soul of forefathers Curtis Mayfield, David Axelrod, and Isaac Hayes, and newer conductors like Adrian Younge and BADBADNOTGOOD. While there are standout songs,   should be played without breaks to thoroughly absorb its scene-setting ambience. This is a fluid arrangement, each track blending seamlessly into the next for a textured listen. Oreilles harbors a distinct ‘70s ethos, yet it draws from the same well of which rapper Ghostface Killah and producer Madlib pull their sounds.

Their new album,  —their first in five years—is no exception, but it offers an added twist to the equation: an idyllic alternative to a world rife with sinister forces. The album begins with a look deep into the past. Opening track “Gold Rush” examines America’s history of exploitation with an unflinching gaze; at one point, over a mesmerizing tangle of horns and keys, lead singer Duke Amayo cries out the names of Native American tribes who have been torn apart, and often exterminated, by the forces of capitalism and human cruelty. “Hook & Crook” treads on similar themes, but also finds Amayo flying to the peak of Kilimanjaro “to gain an outer worldly perspective.” What does he find there? The need to “detach, detach.” It’s a pivotal moment that segues into the album’s three-part finale “Tombstown,” which depicts an island “rich of gold, lush with green” whose residents live in peace. Unfolding over a total of 15 minutes, the “Tombstwn” suite allows the entire 12-piece band ample time to flex their muscles as Amayo buries himself into a sumptuous (and imaginary) world.

In the late 2000s, singer and guitarist Buzz Osborne complained that Melvins were too often stereotyped by lazy listeners as a slow band when they actually had plenty of speedier numbers in their repertoire. He’d be hard pressed to deny that  ’s songs veer back towards the slower end. Yet in a refreshing twist to Melvins’ usual Sabbath-smitten sound, they’re also kinda light and breezy, even lighter than the “Melvins Lite” incarnation of the group from circa 2012. Naturally, Osborne’s phat riffs and Dale Crover’s Bonham-esque drum fireworks remain present and correct, but there’s a novel softness here to suggest the two hard-rock curmudgeons may finally be starting to chill. Perhaps the laid-back feel is thanks to latest bass recruit, Redd Kross’ Steven McDonald, who has been a perma-grinning and happy-go-lucky presence on the band’s recent tours.

On  , their recently-released sixth full-length album (excluding a handful of instrumental LPs), Fact and EP have turned this bewildering barrage into a massive manifesto, but it’s also just another chapter in their long-running gag. That the Doppelgangaz don’t take themselves too seriously is obvious; that they never let up on their bit is the real accomplishment. Until recently, the Doppelgangaz pushed a smooth-around-the-edges style of boom-bap, using dusty beats as the backdrop for tortuous plots.   confirms a recent and still developing turn in which they lean nostalgically into smooth R&B and G-funk without sacrificing the shock value of their tongue-in-cheek horrorcore. “Strong Ankles,” with its pristine synths and bubbling bass, might be a sultry banger in another MC’s hands, and while Fact and EP turn it into a love song of sorts, their barometers for attraction are morsels of lovey-dovey repulsion. “Shorty sneeze guacamole and when she’s bleeding it’s ragu,” Fact quips at one point, never letting on that a joke has been told. “Rapamycin,” named for a non-recreational pharmaceutical you won’t hear anyone else in the rap game brag about, is a mission statement on debauchery and gourmet tastes alike. Then on “Roll Flee,” EP strings together enough exotic rarities to trigger a dozen new Google searches. That skin condition of his you can’t stop looking at? It’s not mites, it’s a form of herpes called zoster. His four-legged companion? A Madagascan mammal called a fossa. The dinner bill they’re dashing from? An extravagant sushi lineup from New York’s famous Masa. All this in a few grinning, spectacular bars. It sounds random because, well, it is, but the Doppelgangaz revel in this type of weirdo world-building. Baffling vocabulary and clever lyricism allow both rappers to say a lot with a little. Then again, even once you’ve sussed out a meaning, you might still wonder what the hell these guys are talking about. There’s no setup or post-joke wink in a Doppelgangaz verse. There’s no punchline at all. They’re just shining their spotlight into the darker crevices of a shared imagination. —", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "hardcore"]}
{"album": "Mister Mellow", "artist": "Washed Out", "description": "It’s been nearly four years since Ernest Greene released  , his sophomore album as Washed Out. On its nine tracks, the Georgia musician—known for his hazy electro-pop—pushed himself to become a better songwriter. The results were especially enjoyable, which led to more critical acclaim for Greene, who seemed determined to distance himself from chillwave, a subgenre he helped define with his 2009 breakthrough single, “ ,” which is also the theme song to IFC comedy series  . Greene’s new album,  , is yet another departure for him: here, he reflects on what it means to be a young adult in these trying times. That topic hits home for the 34-year-old Greene, though he doesn’t take it too seriously. “The album guides the listener through the highs and lows of this often ridiculous struggle,” says an album description on label Stones Throw’s website. To convey the absurdity of everyday life, Greene litters   with oddball samples, twisting the cuts to make them sound even crazier. On “Zonked” and “I’ve Been Daydreaming My Entire Life,” in particular, the manipulated effects add moments of levity, defusing the gravity of such a weighty topic. Humor aside,   contains some of Greene’s best work to date, as he drifts into new sonic territory without completely giving up his core approach. See “Hard to Say Goodbye,” where the musician blends woozy vocals and a foot-stomping house beat, eschewing his usual oceanic vibe for the club’s dark corners and colorful lights. Overall,   is the sound of confidence, a testament to a man who’s eager to experiment and have fun while doing so. Sure, some of these tracks are delivered with a wink and an elbow, but there’s no denying the sincerity by which he conveys his message.

He can stretch a note, then round it off neat; he enunciates clearly and declaims with range; he is equal parts strength and  , and zero parts smarm. You imagine it comes as the result of great experience, which it does. He’s worked with late legendary bandleader Horace Tapscott and current tenor-sax torchbearer Kamasi Washington. He sings mantras with Pharoah Sanders, format-breaking compositions with Nicole Mitchell, and electronic cut-and-paste with Mark de Clive-Lowe and Carlos Niño. His new album was made in England with trumpeter and producer Matthew Halsall, far from the fertile musical groundswell of Los Angeles. But it does find him in the taproot of his jazz endeavors—it’s a straightforward, straight-ahead showcase for his earnest interpretations. It’s called  , which could well apply to his repertoire choices. Spiritual concerns are considered in “Heaven & Hell” by Dorothy Ashby and “Dear Lord” by Alice Coltrane. A single pedal point on “What The World Needs Now” and a wholly-committed essay on “Feeling Good” chug along at an even pace. The standard “I Love Paris” and Donny Hathaway’s commentary “Tryin’ Times” deliver equal intensity to different ends. Folk song “Black Is The Colour of My True Love’s Hair” and spiritual “Deep River” connect to longer histories. It’s all clearly executed with full-throated investment, which makes it easy to believe he’s inspired. The setting, however, is more a blowing session than a syncretic collaboration. The bulk of   takes place at relaxed or slower tempos. The rhythm section of Taz Modi (piano), Gavin Barras (bass), and Jon Scott (drums, chiefly) is tactful and propulsive as necessary, but generally unobtrusive. Similarly, Halsall solos with restraint and ample space—he certainly doesn’t upstage his guest. If you know what else the leading men are capable of, perhaps you’d be looking for a deeper synthesis of big ears. Then again, there’s not really a bad way to hear Dwight Trible meld a familiar song into his own. —", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

On its recent EP,  , the Brooklyn quartet offers four songs that use indie rock as a gateway for more expansive sounds, continuing the heavily-detailed miniaturist mode that drew attention to their 2016 self-titled debut EP. Psychedelia at its best works as a synthesis of opposites; happy contradictions animate Crumb’s work. The group is fronted by singer and guitarist Lila Ramani, whose unhurried delivery communicates a certain restlessness, as she leads her bandmates through intimate territory that seems emotionally vast. On the title track, for instance, she describes the effect that precipitation has on her emotional state: “Every time it rains,” Ramani sings, “I can feel my brain is moving, back and forth, upside down, east-west.” The music on   bucks against the claustrophobia of the lyrics, with meaty bass from Jesse Brotter and myriad flourishes from Brian Aronow, who plays a variety of instruments in service of the record’s quiet sonic diversity. It feels like a milder version of Tame Impala’s reverberating guitar, bass and synth combos, or a slightly more cheerful echo of Whitney’s melancholy Americana. And Ramani, whose lyrics hint at heartbreak, is a remarkably easygoing vocalist, her voice winding its way around the riffage. On “Thirty-Nine,” she casually prompts the band to let loose with one of several killer instrumental breaks, singing deadpan, “I hope they’re ready for the hot, crispy sound.” That’s all it takes for the rest of the group to join in, with all the relaxed proficiency for which it’s becoming known. —", "genre": ["Rock", "fusion"]}

Over a wash of bright piano, strings, and a delightful bass groove, May croons, “I’m gonna live forever until I’m dead!” This is, in seven words, the story of his remarkable new album: it’s about the indulgences of life and the inevitability of our destruction, buoyed by pillowy melodies and eclectic, retro sounds. Originally from Mississippi, May moved to L.A. a few years ago.   uses a rich sonic palette to explore the existential side of California glam: a collage of disco strings, crystalline guitars (with the occasional harmonized fuzz solo), and bright-eyed piano chording. Over the ‘80s pop thrum of “Picture On A Screen,” he ponders our affection for digitized incarnations of people we may never meet, while the echoey, barroom-piano shuffle of “90210” finds him adapting to his new West Coast home. “Face Down in the Gutter of Your Love” brings plucky funk riffing and a string-driven, stomp-and-clap boogie breakdown to the fore. May wants to engage earnestly with cotton-candy poptimism just as much as he wants to poke holes in those same enticing, falsified structures—and in doing so, he weaves a playful, warm soundscape over which to ponder our mortality and loneliness. Throughout the record, we’re teased with the torturous hope that we might overcome our bleak realities. The magic of  is that May doesn’t have any easy answers, but the pop hooks lure us in, inviting us to suss out these universal ambiguities right alongside him. —", "genre": ["Pop", "indie pop"]}

While Lee is a master of digital samples and beats, every note Bei Bei plays enjoys its own life and meaning. On “Love in Hong Kong” and “Year of the Funky,” Bei Bei improvises inventively over Lee’s dance beats. Her guzheng sounds particularly rich accompanied by mallet instruments, as on “Purple River,” where she deploys tactically precise quavers over Lee’s four-on-the-floor. But her playing displays a different quality entirely on tracks like the traditional Chinese folk song “Water Lotus,” which she performs subtly behind the beat, over Lee’s liquid bass lines and hand percussion. The duo extend their parameters on “Black Nylon,” a guzheng boogie punctuated with sharp attacks, and “Danxia Disco,” a modern take on happy hour at the Hong Kong Hilton circa 1982. The duo’s elegant minimalism comes together sublimely on closing track “For Your Smile,” in which Bei Bei duets poignantly with herself over Lee’s retro beats.

He first gained notice working with then-roommate Josh Wink on 1990’s “Tribal Confusion” by E-Culture; a few years later, he became Digable Planets’ tour DJ. And he’s cultivated a number of widely differing aliases and project names. As Sylk 130, Britt spearheaded a luxurious neo-soul live band; as the Nova Dream Sequence, he paid explicit homage to Detroit techno. Fhloston Paradigm (named for Fhloston Paradise, a planet in the 1997 film  ) is Britt in womb-like ambient mode—the man clearly spent some quality time with space-staring labels like Apollo and Rising High. Creating a sound palette to be “used only in that project,” as he told  , Britt set out to make a drum-less and lyric-less album—though hardly one devoid of vocals.

Her music—a darker take on Americana that calls to mind Lee Hazlewood and Mazzy Star—should be hits in another world’s Top 40, no question, but they’re definitely not crap. Range is key throughout  . One of the album’s quietest songs, “Mary,” is nestled at the heart of the album, and is immediately followed up with the big, easy-going swagger of “Life’s A Lie.” Other songs carefully invert expectations: “Paranoia” starts with bass and vocals only, suggesting a bleaker approach, but then shifts into a lovely, downright uplifting full arrangement and chorus before concluding with a big—but not ham-fisted—ending. That makes the slow doom grind of “Nothing” hit harder, with growling tones underscoring its final two minutes, like a threat. If the album has a standout track, it’s “Soon,” an intimate performance which showcases Von Schleicher’s precise creative control. You can hear that focus in the way gentle drum taps cut through the arrangement, the way the keyboards and guitars complement and echo each other, the way saxophone carefully emerges towards the end, and the way that ending is sudden, but not abrupt.

Martin’s craft defies simple boundaries: he looks to icons like Miles Davis and Charlie Parker with the same regard he has for hometown hero DJ Quik and new jack swing pioneer Teddy Riley. On  , Martin further showcases his creative growth while giving a platform to a small group of frequent collaborators he named The Pollyseeds. Martin’s varied sonic influences play a key role in this album’s diversity.  ’s lead single, “Intentions,” stacks G-funk synths over Prince’s renowned Linndrum, leading to a suitable backdrop for Chachi’s (Compton MC Problem’s alter ego) scenic club narrative. Capping things off with a nod to Debarge’s 1982 classic “I Like It,” the end result sounds like the natural evolution for a generation raised on Dr. Dre’s  . Elsewhere, with the help of friend and famed pianist Robert Glasper, Martin’s vocoder rendition of Janet Jackson deep cut “Funny How Time Flies” nods to the arrangements perfected by Herbie Hancock during his late ‘70s fusion period. “Mama D/Leimert Park” (named after a landmark for L.A.’s avant-garde jazz and hip-hop scenes) is steeped in traditionalism: a loop of the infamous “Impeach The President” drum break provides the necessary edge to keep the song’s breezy saxophone lines from tipping over into spineless cool jazz. Songs like “Feelings Of The World” tap into common daily struggles, as Chachi and vocalist Rose Gold sing the blues of coping with different crises—eviction and a relationship shattered by infidelity—while accompanied by a wailing electric guitar. With  , Martin executes each small step with precise vision, spreading messages of peace along the way. The album concludes with “Don’t Trip,” a riveting gospel-based composition on which singer Preston Harris plays the role of a choir soloist.

His compositions, and the label itself, serve multiple purposes: to make the avant-garde more accessible, while pushing the limits of pop music. On  , Gunther’s third LP as Dzang, the multi-instrumentalist crafts dance-indebted rap, gorgeous piano ballads, and everything in between. Gunther uses   as a showcase for L.A.’s up-and-coming singers and songwriters, allowing vocalists like Maria Minerva and Olivia Kaplan to shine without obstruction. Minerva and Kaplan are featured on two songs apiece, and their voices mesh perfectly with Gunther’s slinking psychedelic romps and minimal, pop-oriented melodies. Elsewhere, on “So Young,” an alt-R&B tune with massive percussion, Gunther enlists L.A. mainstay Maxim Ludwig, whose floating hums wash in from a celestial place. Conversely, on album opener “My Name (Nana),” Gunther gets help from rapper Don Christian, who spits double-time flows over an austere dance beat and pitch-shifted vocals. This and other tracks speak to Gunther’s equally thrilling and off-kilter sonic world. Though Dzang is a project based on collaboration, some of  ’s strongest moments come when Gunther performs alone. “Supercomplication” is a warm, electro-shoegaze anthem, blending the astral progressions of M83 with the low-end thump of Flying Lotus’s early beat scene forays. The album’s final track, “Take You Down To,” begins with hypnotic looping before descending into free jazz. Its thumping, four-on-the-floor bass drum keeps the song rooted. ’s most impressive trick isn’t the album’s diversity, it’s how seamlessly this multitude of influences blend into something entirely fresh.

After a chance encounter with Daptone Records producer Michael Reilly, the Como Mamas recorded their 2013 debut,  , at Mt. Moriah; its 13 tracks were comprised solely of their voices.

But instead of diluting the trio’s magnetic voices, the arrangements, recorded live in the studio by Daptone Records’ “family band,” give the songs momentum and energy. While the band’s contributions are at times minimal—like the sparse percussion on “Glory Glory Hallelujah”—they can also pivot on a dime, delivering a walloping proto-blues romp.

Thematically, the album is grounded, fully, in the culture of the church. As Daniels recently explained, “In Como, church is  ,” and these songs, all of which are interpretations of old traditionals and spirituals, focus on themes of redemption, gratitude and the glory of a higher power. Yet it’s hard to approach these sentiments solely through the lens of religion; the Como Mamas lived through segregation in a largely impoverished town, and have seen tough times become, at least on surface level, less so. As Smith explained recently, she’s “infinitely grateful to God for giving her the resources to raise two kids who never had to pick cotton, wear clothes made from old flour sacks, or go hungry in lean times” like she did.

While it’s easy to call this album avant-garde or psychedelic due to its spectral mood, it’s really that   is a remarkably focused effort that’s rooted in jazz while pulling in hip-hop, folk, and ambient work. Branch arrives at her debut having spent her formative years in the Chicago music scene, where she played with noise-rock group Musket and experimental jazz trio Rupert, among many other outfits.

Atop brittle, needling guitars and rigid grooves, Brown seems to mine the pain of repressive adolescence in strikingly literal terms. When Brown isn’t near sobbing, he’s   sobbing; it sounds channeled from within the process of confronting trauma, rather than from some later moment of relative resolution, especially on the 2015 full-length  Institute’s first record since, is a slight yet significant departure. A thicker and firmer recording, it’s more akin to Institute’s punchy live presence (and less to the old leftist English punk band Crisis). Far from the great jostling simplicity of early material like “Giddy Boys,” the songs on   expand to accommodate instrumental detours. And Brown, though still a wailer, mixes his spittle with a bit more venom. The lyrics refer to “oil wealth” in a “Southern state” rife with racist “good ol’ boys,” plus heteronormative indoctrination via television and how “sexually insecure police cause violence.” (There are certainly shades of The Dicks’ classic “Hate the Police.”) He’s zooming out, dismayed by how patriarchy and racism conspire to impoverish and destroy nonconforming bodies.  . You won’t make out many of the words (there’s a lyrics sheet), but the band’s politics are refreshingly earnest. Brown uses vocabulary—words like “bourgeois,” which he memorably burps in two songs—that other contemporary punk lyricists might find pretty tired or hackneyed. It works because, rather than taking a stance of righteous distance, Brown’s queasy delivery and personal tie-ins emphasize the suffocating omnipresence of intersecting oppressions—much like The Dicks’ Gary Floyd. Critical observation leaves him indignant as well as depressed, no further from a society that prescribes him an unwanted sort of masculinity—just more aware of the coercion.", "genre": ["Punk", "post-punk"]}

On their latest full-length,  , Beach Fossils add even more nuance to their brand of melancholy guitar pop. While the music is bright and playful, the lyrics find Payseur struggling through loneliness, underscoring the impermanence of personal relationships. The heady, mid-tempo, piano-pop groover “Saint Ivy” combines a bouncy rhythm with dynamic classical strings, as Payseur’s lyrics touch on both cynicism and hopefulness.

Underneath the gauzy instrumentation, Payseur’s vocal refrain—“On the outside, change your mind, feeling nothing”—hints at detachment and alienation. The album closes with the softly-jangling “That’s All for Now,” which opens with sorrowful lyrics: “It’s new regret / Isn’t it funny how we forget?” Payseur sings.

No longer sufficed by one-step-back storytelling, Lenker takes on the demanding process of revisiting her childhood on  , but chooses to meet the painful moments with a emotional strength born from empathy. The bracing manner of her retelling an assault on “Watering” finds her regaining control over trauma. Elements of mortality appear throughout: tears, blood, oxygen, skin, sexual fluids. Lenker’s perspective changes from storyteller to active participant, speaking as her present self: “And you know that I’m there / As you soak in my stare.” As “Watering” finishes on a tender note, Lenker relieves her younger self of the pain and guilt that has festered for too long. Big Thief attunes their music to fit the finer details, as on “Shark Smile,” where a harrowing tale of losing someone in a car accident is met with classic rock gravitas. The entire song plays like  -era Springsteen, sparking with the insistent riffs of a midnight road trip as Lenker’s escapism runs into reality: “It came over me at a bad time / She burned over the double line / And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail.” Her last lines spark with a hint of regret, but abruptly let go with the track’s hard stop. As the album concludes its excavation of Lenker’s past, the atmosphere on the later songs becomes solitary and therapeutic. The necessary determination of electric guitars and painful recollections dissolve into acoustic instruments, subtle rhythms, and meditative serenity. Accented by organ hum and solo piano, the chorus on “Mary” works as a focused mantra, sweeping away bitter remnants with lilting elegance.  For the whole of  , Lenker and Big Thief firmly take the wheel of each song’s narrative, spinning together threads of memories and events, weaving them into newfound empowerment.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"]}
{"album": "Agent blå", "artist": "Agent blå", "description": "Rarely has a singer sounded more urgent than Agent blå’s Emelie Alatalo does when she pleads “Tell me what the fuck we’re doing!” midway through “Rote Learning.” Indeed, the majority of the group’s gripping self-titled debut swings between the twin poles of anxiety and desperation, goaded on by white-knuckle percussion and guitars that glimmer and sear like sunlight hitting glass. The Gothenburg group—whose members are still, mostly, teenagers—write songs that center around neuroses; sometimes, they’re romantic (“Frustrerad” peaks with Alatalo howling, “Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me…up”), but most of the time they’re panicked responses to everyday dilemmas. Album opener “Derogatory Embrace” rockets out of the gate with roundhouse drumming and a guitar line that sounds lifted from an early Cure demo, as Alatalo, with her deep-blue alto, bellows, “I’m stuck with feeling / Like I’ve met everyone worth meeting.” The rest of the record is just as tightly wound. The roaring “Strand” is an anthem caked in icicles, the dueling guitars of Felix Skörvald and Lucas Gustavsson jutting up the center, sharp and crystalline. Like much of   the action unfolds in jittery fast-forward: “Dizzy blurs left behind blonde highlights / Different kisses every night.” Skörvald, Gustavsson, and Alatalo used to play Joy Division covers together at local open mics, and  manages to capture all of that group’s darkness with none of the nihilism. “(Don’t) Talk to Strangers” subtly cops the spiraling guitar arpeggio of “Don’t Stop Believin’” for a song that’s just as anthemic in its own way, and is centered around advice from Alatalo that feels as if it was learned first-hand: “Don’t talk to strangers / You’ll fall in love with them.” “Red, White Rose” is a harrowing bit of divebombing goth-pop, Alatalo singing of cigarettes and lipstick stains while Skörvald and Gustavsson drape guitars like black lace around her. And while  may spasm with nervousness, there’s a sense of exultation, too. The sweaty recklessness of youth only comes around once; you may as well throw yourself into all of it. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "goth"]}
{"album": "A World of Masks", "artist": "The Heliocentrics", "description": "Instead of orbiting a single musical style, the Heliocentrics’ expansive jams spiral out into countless galaxies of sound. The U.K. ensemble has spent years squeezing fragments of hip-hop, jazz, psych, and krautrock into their hypnotic, thrumming compositions since debuting on DJ Shadow’s 2006 album  . The group’s fourth album,  , boasts a similar blend of sounds, but the addition of Slovakian vocalist Barbora Patkova brings a fresh element, putting their minor-key grooves into thrilling new context. Although Patkova, like her new bandmates, has a tendency to construct music out of improvised jams, her melodies here are airtight and highly finessed. On opening track “Made of the Sun,” she delivers a scorching, operatic performance that stands in sharp contrast to the slow-burning arrangement. On “Oh Brother,” she snakes effortlessly through an avalanche of percussion and, on the title track, she seems to disappear into a hazy horn arrangement. Which is not to say that the Heliocentrics themselves don’t bring the heat;  remains a largely instrumental affair, full of complex rhythmic ideas and taut horn lines. Drummer and bandleader Malcolm Catto continues to deliver deft work, particularly on the nimble “The Silverback” and the aptly-titled “Human Zoo.” Jake Ferguson’s agile bass parts add a subtle warmth throughout the album, and Oliver Parfitt’s sprinkles of keyboards provide a balance to the group’s thundering low end, like on the lurching “Dawn Chorus.” While the album doesn’t necessarily revolve around Patkova, the Heliocentrics’ constellation benefits from her captivating presence—and, as a result, burns all the brighter. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Freedom of Movement", "artist": "Nina Miranda", "description": "In 1997, Nina Miranda’s voice became familiar to U.K. trip-hop fans thanks to the overnight success of her band Smoke City’s single, “Underwater Love.” (Michel Gondry even used it in a   he directed.) It’s not difficult to understand why the song was a success. Miranda and her band engineered a fusion between bossa nova and trip-hop that benefitted from her cultural fluidity—she’s of British and Brazilian descent. Navigating between those two worlds, she drew from both her knowledge of  , aka MPB, as well as the sounds of ‘90s Britain (think: Basement Jaxx, Massive Attack). Miranda sang—half in Portuguese, half in English—in the soft, melodic lilt typical of the bossa nova singers of the ’60s, using the beauty and gentleness of one language and the brevity and directness of the other to paint a picture of living and loving in two cultures. On her first solo album,  Miranda builds on that blueprint, creating music that straddles the line between nostalgia for her homeland, and the need to embrace the world that surrounds her. Perhaps that’s why   feels like a musical tug-of-war. On tracks like “Capoeira 2020,” “Julia,” and “Silken Horse,” Miranda playfully explores samba percussion, mixing it with nu-disco, funk, and bossa nova. But she’s also not afraid to experiment: “The Cage” combines buzzsaw guitars with ‘70s funk basslines, distorted vocals, and soulful choruses, while its lyrics plead for freedom in a country that’s growing increasingly restrictive. Miranda’s voice shines on the dramatic slow burner “Amazonia Amor,” where she trades verses with both a male vocalist and the sounds of the rainforest. The net effect recalls Carla Bruni’s performance of “Dolce Francia”—both songs are beautiful homages to the respective singers’ homelands.  is Miranda’s way of reintroducing herself to the world as both a singer and performer, an album that revels in experimentation, but doesn’t shy away from embracing tradition.

{"album": "Friends Live #1", "artist": "Band Practice & Catherine Cohen", "description": "The most important question a live album answers isn’t “What’d they play?” or “How’d they sound?,” it’s “What was it like to be there?” When it comes to documenting a moment, to creating a record that prizes spit as much as shine, this new split release — the first in a series from “holistic” NYC publisher and promoter JMC Aggregate — nails the feeling of being a small club watching working artists do their thing. Throughout  , comedian Catherine Cohen and singer/guitarist Jeanette Wall (aka the surprisingly Googleable Band Practice) ride a wave of giddy, nervous energy. The applause is enthusiastic but sparse. The mood is loose and friendly, raw and real. It’s not lo-fi, but it is distinctly, proudly no-frills. Wall goes first, juxtaposing her dry one-liners with vulnerable asides and disarmingly sincere love songs. The unsettlingly pretty “Freddy” imagines romance on Elm Street. “Put Up a Fight” is a peppy little anthem for adorable fuckups. “I want to get real lost,” she sings over a casually strummed guitar on the brooding standout track “I Wanna Die Like Elvis.” “I’m gonna make you love me and see how much it costs.” Wall’s style is charmingly funny, genuine, defiant, and coy—all at once. Wall introduces Cohen by saying things are about to get weird, and she’s not wrong. “I’m fun, I’m chill, I’m a guy’s girl,” Cohen says before unleashing a laugh that teeters on goat-ish. “I say that because I have a tilted uterus.” What does that mean? No idea. But it works. Cohen’s comedy moves quickly, sometimes switching from millennial NYC vapidity to absurd non sequiturs so quickly your mind may start trying to connect dots that aren’t there. “I keep doing this weird thing where I forget that nothing matters,” she says early on, and that’s pretty much her in a nutshell. —", "genre": ["Comedy", "indie", "indie rock"]}

Like much of  , the song is held together by Dunis’s hazy, understated vocals, so serene and meditative it sounds like she’s slowly drifting to another plane of being. Other songs are propelled by an undulating drive and pulse. “Love Can Move Mountains” recalls the sound of Factory Records, with a primitive rhythm and minimalist synths. “Everytime I See the Light” blinks and bustles like early ‘80s new wave, Dunis’s voice snaking between the pinprick electronics.

Each week, they issued a new cassette with a slightly varied collection of muzak, Top 40 songs, and eerily upbeat store ads. In 2015, former Kmart employee Mark Davis uploaded the 56 KMRT tapes he’d collected between 1989 and 1992 to  .

{"album": "Vibrations 1978-1982", "artist": "Creation Rebel", "description": "The music of Creation Rebel has featured some of reggae’s greatest singers and players, but it’s best understood as a vehicle for the creativity of one man: Adrian Sherwood. Creation Rebel came into being when Sherwood—a young studio hound and a face on London’s post-punk scene—was passed tapes of Jamaica’s The Arabs, who were then Prince Far-I’s backing band. Working with engineer Dennis Bovell, he drenched the album with delay and overdubs, and the result was 1978’s  , an audacious experiment in sustained dub techniques that went as far as anything coming out of Jamaica—if not further. A Bandcamp exclusive digital-only compilation on Sherwood’s revived On-U Sound imprint,   collects music from Creation Rebel’s brief four years of life. Often, it distinguishes itself through Sherwood’s boldness of vision. Take “Starship Africa Section 3” and “Space Movement Section 2” from the group’s 1980 album  , on which a mislaid tape of riddims from the forgotten DJ Superstar is catapulted into the cosmos, with tracks spun backwards, drums layered over drums, and voices sped up to chipmunk pitch. Elsewhere, we hear Sherwood refining his sound, toning down the madness a notch, and melding his spacious style with some talented players, many of whom would become mainstays of the On-U roster. Prince Far-I brings thunderous rasta soul to “Frontline Speech,” Doctor Pablo weaves a wistful melodica through the clockwork rhythms of “Doctor’s Remedy,” and bassist “Lizard” Logan and drummer Lincoln Scott emerge as one of dub’s great rhythm sections, punchy and creative and full of groove. —", "genre": ["Reggae", "dub"]}
{"album": "Soaked", "artist": "Hot Flash Heat Wave", "description": ", the second record from San Francisco’s Hot Flash Heat Wave is about the highs and lows of young love—its bright guitars and breezy melodies are seemingly custom-built for summer BBQ playlists. Largely ditching the garage rock riffs and distortion that comprised 2015’s   on   Hot Flash Heat Wave settle into something much softer and more relaxed. There’s a passing resemblance to the jangly sound of early Mac DeMarco, with a stronger emphasis on early Beatles-esque harmonies. It helps that the group is something of a vocalist triple-threat: bassist Ted Davis and guitarists Nathaniel Blüm and Adam Abildgaard each take lead vocals for about a third of the album apiece. The trade-off gives the album variety: Davis’s tortured screams power the punky “Bye Bye Baby,” and Abildgaard’s laid-back crooning glide across “San Francisco Dating Life.” Produced by Jeff Saltzman (who also helmed The Killers’  ),   feels brighter, cleaner, and more spacious—especially when compared to  ’s tense rumble. Album highlights like “Raindrop” and “Gold Years” view past relationships through the lens of nostalgia. “Remember the nights and all the dreams we had that made us who we are,” goes the opening of “Gold Years,” “All those years, talking ‘bout the future seemed like speeding cars that drove right past.” The chorus aches to reclaim all the heady emotion of the past, hoping to “never let them go” again.

Drummers   and Dave Treut help heat things up; cellist Markia Hughes swoops in to cool things down. But Seabrook’s guitar leads are paramount here—darting, dizzying, dazzling, and trilling, forever daring the others to keep pace. “Clangorous Vistas” is a hailstorm of scraped riffs. “Abccessed Pettifogger” jerks from math rock to brush-strings to percussive sprints. On the all-to-brief “Litany of Turncoats,” all seven players stir up a furious, glorious din. Churning headrush “The Greatest Bile Pt. 1” wheels spastically between punk, metal, and psych, before yielding near its end for a Hughes solo. Comparatively contemplative for its first half, “The Greatest Bile Pt. 2” eventually succumbs to chaos. There is a capricious and exploratory quality to this music that’s reminiscent of Japan’s   and the oeuvre of John Zorn, who is among Seabrook’s many past collaborators. What sets  apart is that it’s permitted to catch its breath, to catapult into weirder directions; it’s not  full-bore all the time. “Quickstep Grotesquerie,” a bizarre sinkhole of effects and lysergic vocals, shines a spotlight on  ’s secret MVP: NYC-based noise artist Chuck Bettis, of  .

That’s part of its elegance and efficacy, as much as its range is. But it’s also catchy, and well-constructed in terms of pure songwriting, and while there’s no room for mistakes, she makes none.

Rebecca “FIN” Simonetti is a New York multimedia artist—in one   she hung a replica of a lamb from the ceiling with harnesses; blobby, pink, flower-shaped objects sprung from its carcass. Her music has a bit of that same horror-film ruthlessness. She approaches pop from a clinical distance, slicing it up then smiling as it staggers forward. On “In Silver,” she whispers “Tik tik tik” at the beginning of the track, then chops her voice up and adds multitracked layers, creating both calculated bliss and blissful calculation. “Gutshot” heads towards Danielle Dax territory, with spacey, clattering power chords, and a beat that walks onto the dance floor to sway with the vampires. “Daughters” is built around a tinkling music box motif which turns into a siren-like electronic industrial clamor; it sounds like an infant crawling through a steel mill. The lyric, “Put your hands in the air, I’ll cut them off with a knife,” nicely sums up FIN’s aesthetic. FIN takes similar cues from performers like Björk and FKA twigs, who use arty dissonance and broken beats to heighten emotional intensity and create deeper personal expression.

The result of this creative respite and reflection is  , an album weighted heavily by Maguire’s bucolic surroundings and his self-imposed solitude. Historically, Pile’s LPs have never had much of a central theme. But on  , the thirteen tracks are connected by a clear thread of consternation. “Leaning on a Wheel” displays a prickly restlessness in its flirtation with Americana and acrimony. “So play in traffic/ Have a kid/ And may every good deed be in self-interest” is a statement charged with resentment. Leading with cutthroat strings under percussionist Kris Kuss’s simmering drumroll, “Rope’s Length” evokes an unsettling disconnect. When we reach the chorus “But I want it at rope’s length/ If I’m not being used”, the song’s protagonist is already proverbially lost at sea. Pile have always been masters of askew chord progressions, and on   these riffs pair with lyrical brooding to add an extra layer of tension. The sense of chagrin that’s woven into   goes beyond bellowing and bombast. “Making Eyes,” with its reluctant piano and lumbering tempo, contributes to the song’s theme of cloistered paranoia. As expected, Pile still manage to get in some bruisers like “Texas” that take the reins off of the rhythm section and let dual guitars tangle for some raucous jousting. Bitter sentiment and churning cadence merge on “Dogs,” a pitter-patting of tender chords steadily swelling into an orchestral thunderstorm. Mustering all his spite, Maguire finally cuts loose: “Then I pretend to sleep alone/ I’d rather on the ground than in your bed/ I’ll sleep on the lawn or stay up instead.” For a band that has been so closely tied to its homebase,   is a powerful album driven by anxiety and separation.", "genre": ["Rock", "indie rock"]}

Aussie reissue label Efficient Space excavates 10 such lost wonders on the new compilation  , curated by Sydney-born DJ Steele Bonus. Though united in their unpolished, DIY vibe, the selections cover a wide range of sounds. Some are disturbingly dark (the engrossing bass throb of Prod’s “Knife on Top”; the jarring, competing layers of The Horse He’s Sick’s industrial-edged “Larynx”). Others are almost contagiously bright, like Moral Fibro’s bossa nova-kissed “Take a Walk in the Sun” and Zerox Dreamflesh’s dubby instrumental “Squids Can Fly.” Of them all, the gleefully sacrilegious “Jesus Krist Klap Rap (Orthodox Mix)” from MK Ultra & The Assassins of Light is the most immediately danceable.

Though these songs play with a variety of electronic styles—dance, dream pop, new wave, dance punk, and Italo disco—the album finds the band carving a consistent niche in the ever-expanding world of synth pop. Icy synthetics collide with beachy melodies, shaping an environment that’s both sweaty and chilling. “Mysteries,” an electro-dance delight, sounds like the band is performing at a discotheque cut into a glacier, with candy-colored lights refracting through the crystal and into a purple sky.  allows Sims to slip into a series of characters, turning each song into a vignette that captures her versatility as a performer. On the album’s second track, “Brat,” Sims embodies a glutton without abandon, taking the world for all its worth over a booming Italo disco beat. “I live a life of vice and convenience,” she boasts convincingly. “I live my life in front of the aperture.” Later, on “Swimming,” she’s pleading with a lover to let their tryst continue, while the instrumentals lay a spacious groove. “Stay with me forever/Something in the air that feels so right.” On “All of the Punks,” the album’s most exciting track, Sims synthesizes potent agoraphobia into a banging DFA jam. She sings in a whispered deadpan while the composition swirls in the background, leading to a disorienting combo—almost like being at the club while a panic attack sets in.

The world in which these songs exist is, realistically, a dangerous one. “Tell me what I need to stay safe on the streets” goes the chorus to “Sissy,” and the slow-creeping “Nightcrawler,” with its spider-leg guitars, imagines “exorcism on a billboard stage” and “false needles in my neck.” In the roiling “The Gift of Hell,” the protagonist ends up “drinking with statues at Grand Army Plaza,” and the bitter sentiment is paired with a big, soaring melody. The oppositional stance is key to who Aye Nako are—passionate believers in the value of DIY spaces, who seek to operate outside the commerce-driven music scene. They grapple often with identity—the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality operate in differing ways for the four band members, and exploring these traumas together provides a sense of healing—and they distill their anger, frustration, and iconoclasm into songs that feel urgent and vital. That the songs on   are so unfailingly melodic makes their lyrics land that much harder. A skipping guitar trips along the background of “Spare Me” before the song erupts into full-throated howl; “The Gift of Hell” juxtaposes 20-ton stoner riffs with a haunting, delicate vocal line. And “Tourmaline” is a mini-epic, moving from a slow-gliding opening to a knottier, more fitful middle section. It’s this kind of restlessness and inventiveness that makes   such a gripping listen. It lulls you into comfort before turning the room upside down. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}
{"album": "Horse Follows Darkness", "artist": "Delia Gonzalez", "description": "The backstory behind Delia Gonzalez’s riveting, moving   is almost as rich as the album itself: the album is a kind of soundtrack to Gonzalez’s return to America after a sojourn in Berlin, but Gonzalez also saw parallels between her journey and American Western films of the 1960s. That alone is enough to freight the record with an encyclopedia of ideas, everything from Manifest Destiny to colonialism to the simple idea of an “untamed land” waiting—both ominously and expectantly—for new settlers. What makes the entirely-instrumental   so enthralling is that it never tips over into literalism; there are no prairie whistles or lap steels or cleverly-chosen vocal samples. Instead, Gonzalez explores the idea of travel, transition, and the “Myth of America” through feints and suggestions, with spiderwebs of piano and billowing synths. The steadily-chugging “Hidden Song” is cleft in two by a rude, cutting electric guitar, which slices up the center of Gonzalez’s motorik backdrop like an inebriated guest at a formal dinner party. The elements cohere gradually, the precise arrangements of Krautrock—its lockstep rhythm, waterfall of piano, and bobbing bassline—gradually subsuming the slashing riffs into themselves. The collision of elements, and the acclimation of one to another, feels packed with portent. The title track is full of shadow and space; Gonzalez sketches out a skeletal piano figure, layering linen-like synths on top of it for an end result that feels mournful and isolated. “Roulette,” with its dewdrop guitars and gradually-building rhythm, is expectant and apprehensive all at once. And album-closer “Vesuvius” covers throbbing techno with black-cloud drones, synths sparkling and vanishing like lightning in the background. There’s no single overarching message to  , but that’s precisely what makes it so beguiling. It is simultaneously hopeful and crushing—just like the country it takes as inspiration. —", "genre": ["Electronic", "piano", "atmospheric"]}
{"album": "II", "artist": "Crooked Bangs", "description": "Austin punks  ’ sophomore release,  , is all about duality—nihilistic and hopeful, familiar and unique, harsh and melodic. These songs could soundtrack a skate video or recent footage of clashes between anti-fascists and right-wing extremists in Berkeley. (Guess which side the band is on.) This is the perfect music for an empire in decline, summoning courage in the face of despair and harnessing rage so it becomes the power to fight back. Drummer Phillip Gonzalez’s steady rhythms lay a solid foundation upon which the rest of the band can build. Frontwoman Leda Ginestra’s bass propels the music forward, like a car speeding through a city at night. Guitarist Samantha Wendel, whose playing glides effortlessly from strident, post-punk noise to urgent, straightforward power chords, rounds out the band’s distinctive brand of dark, brooding punk. It all coheres around Ginestra’s versatile vocal delivery. Singing in French and English throughout the record, she gives us deadpan incantations (“We Are Gold”), deep, throaty melodies (“No Future”), staccato chants (“Le Phenix”), and piercing screams (“Baudeliare”).

{"album": "Snow", "artist": "The New Year", "description": "On the New Year’s first record in nine years, songwriter/guitarists Matt and Bubba Kadane coax out a series of low-key indie rock songs that tend toward the contemplative. That’s not necessarily out of the ordinary: The brothers exhibited similarly pensive tendencies in the   of their beloved ’90s band Bedhead, and the New Year’s 2008 self-titled effort was full of dusky elegies. But   is particularly bereft, as it features subtle and rewarding sonic progressions with bittersweet undertones. “Mayday” sighs with resignation, courtesy of majestic electric guitars that grow more agitated as the song unfolds—the sound matches the discord hinted at in the lyrics: “Searching the coffers/For empty offers/I don’t know why/You trust the sky/You must like your lies from blue eyes.” The louder, insistent “The Party’s Over” incorporates anxious doubled guitars and crisp rhythmic slaps, while the languid “Homebody” sticks to the kind of foggy textures and melodies favored by Pavement, Silver Jews, and ’90s-era Built to Spill. Yet   is remarkable not because of its inspirations, but because of its execution. The record boasts elaborate arrangements that make songs feel deliberately and methodically sculpted into shape. The largely instrumental “Myths” swells with dense, interwoven elements—acoustic guitar, salt-shaker percussion, pointed electric melodies and moments of stark sparseness—until the vocals emerge near the end. “The Beast,” meanwhile, starts off as an ears-ringing, droning electric number (think: a hazier Dinosaur Jr.), but suddenly morphs into an immersive song where choppy waves of guitar become subservient to lullaby-like keyboards. The title track and “The Last Fall” are also both softened by solemn electric piano—the latter, with its tangled heap of Chris Brokaw drums and lively melody, is almost jazz-like in its execution. These complexities often amplify  s emotional dismay, especially because Matt Kadane’s vocals are a seamless part of this sonic fabric. On some songs, his voice is submerged in the mix, creating wrenching ambiguity. On “Homebody,” moments of clarity (“No one can see me, I left my body at home/He likes to stay there alone”) alternate with lyrics where the last word drops out (“I can’t get home tonight, I can’t stand on my own two…”), obscuring the line’s meaning. Instead of being frustrating, however, this only adds to the record’s aura of mystery and austerity. In the end,   conjures the kind of grim meditations that arise in the dead of night, when the insomniac combination of restless fatigue and anxiety sweeps through and magnify the mind’s most desolate corners. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock"]}
{"album": "A Common Truth", "artist": "Saltland", "description": "First, you hear that sound—the low shimmer, resonant and grim and loamy, that chamber-music-for-the-bomb-shelter cello. This root integer of modern rock melancholy can be found on all sorts of   albums, especially those from the core roster: Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Thee Silver Mt. Zion,  . The latter two once included cellist and composer Rebecca Foon, whose gorgeous second album under the   solo identity is a meditation on climate change (Foon is a member of the Canadian cooperative consultancy  , a founder of a  , and co-founder of a  ).

There’s the great Warren Ellis (  Bad Seeds, Grinderman), whose loops, violin, and pump organ help anchor “To Allow Us All to Breathe” and the hypnotic instrumentals ”Forward Eyes I” and “Forward Eyes II.”  On “I Only Wish This For You,” producer (and   member) Jace Lasek’s guitar cuts a distorted swath, a slow-mo lightning strike across Foon’s regal, stormy cello. But mostly,   is about Foon and the way she stretches her instrument and her voice, about the textures she builds up. It is one woman making a musical case that is both elegiac and urgent, so it’s almost jarring to hear another voice emerge on “Light of Mercy” when former Silver Mt. Zion bandmate (and Constellation co-founder) Ian Ilavsky’s baritone doubles her silvery vocals. Lasek’s on this one, too; their presence here gives the album a jolt, like maybe the only things we are able to count on when the rains come (and they   come) are our closest compatriots, even as we write our own codas to an earth facing indelible environmental change.", "genre": ["Classical", "experimental rock", "contemporary classical"]}

Clearly Shook’s out to shake things up, even at her own expense. The sound of classic outlaw country and a singular sense of determination are in evidence throughout, not only in the ragged-yet-rollicking rhythms that drive such offerings as “Keep the Home Fires Burnin’,” “The Nail,” and “Make It Up to Mama,” but also in the titles of the songs themselves. “Misery Without Company,” “Nothin’ Feels Right But Doin’ Wrong,” and “Fuck Up” all suggest that Shook’s instincts have a habit of leading her astray. That said, Shook can be dismissive and self-effacing as well. “I’ll drink away my troubles on my own,” she insists on the album’s weary, pedal-steel-laced title track. The upbeat shuffle of “Nothin’ Feels Right But Doin’ Wrong” finds her tallying her vices, declaring “I’ve got cocaine in my bloodstream and whiskey on my breath.” And if there’s still any lingering doubt that she’s prone to questionable choices, her blatant admission that she’s “too much of a fuck up” makes that sentiment plain. While Shook spends plenty of time taking stock of her actions, she occasionally skews introspective. There’s a strange backstory behind the crush she conveys for the man name-checked in “Dwight Yoakam,” and even the disappointment she shares on “Solitary Confinement” leads to a sudden shift in emotion.

The layered guitar work on “Understanding Gravity” recalls Doug Martsch’s intricate overdubs from Built to Spill’s  . On “No News,” Van Asselt recounts the routine of scrolling through a newsfeed without absorbing its contents. He skims headlines just long enough to know that “each one is worse than the last one.” Quieting their instruments and their voices, the band coaxes us to come a bit closer while they share two lines to live by, though when juxtaposed, more closely resemble a contradiction: “All press is good press, but no news is good news.” Direct and simply said, these lyrical remarks offer the most insightful consideration of how to take care of yourself in a time like this—how to find peace in anything when you can find danger in everything.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie rock", "indie pop"]}

This album,  , has a hazy quality, and if the aforementioned quote is meant to instruct, Wallace doesn’t plan to follow along.

Here, the singer contemplates getting older, could-have-beens, and the slowly dawning realization that life changes are inevitable and continual. Accordingly,   is a moody, mellow collection built around acoustic guitar and synthesizers.

DeMarco is struck by his growing resemblance to his father on opener “My Old Man,” which pairs a pinging drum machine beat with a rich acoustic guitar part. The spare, whispery “Sister” plays like a heartsick apology, but DeMarco doesn’t milk it: the song is over in less than 90 seconds. The quiet, effects-treated guitar and DeMarco’s somber voice give the track an air of heavy sadness, but not everything on the album is such a garment-render. “Baby You’re Out” bobs along on a sunny mix of acoustic guitar and bassy synths as DeMarco counsels against regret, while “A Wolf Who Wears Sheeps Clothes” alternates his vocals with harmonica layered over a thick, rubbery guitar riff. Though these 13 songs are steeped in nuance, DeMarco’s fondness for gauzy soft-rock aesthetics makes some of the guitar riffs and drum patterns similar enough on the surface that it can take a while before the tunes sink in. As a result, the album drags here and there, and some of the most obvious differences among tracks come in DeMarco’s choice of synth tones: so bright it’s almost brittle on “For the First Time,” or klaxon-like on the domineering father-son pep talk “On the Level.” Despite the occasional dips in momentum,   is worth diving into.

{"album": "Synthesize the Soul: Astro-Atlantic Hypnotica From the Cape Verde Islands 1973-1988", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "For the better part of five centuries, the West African coastal territories now known as Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde islands languished under the influence and brutal control of colonial Portugal. By the early 1960s, the contentious struggle for freedom had erupted into an all-out war for national independence. By 1975, the Cape Verde islands and Guinea-Bissau were free from Portuguese rule, embarking on the long journey of post-colonial reformation. Throughout the next decade and a half, the cultural life of the Cape Verdean islands exploded, giving birth to a number of bands who took the islands’ traditional/indigenous styles and fused them with Portuguese fado (the folk music of Portugal’s urban poor and working class), while also taking influences from the rock and R&B sounds that had been coming over from the States. This eclectic mixture of musical ingredients helped produce a dynamic music community that would carry the spirit of the Cape Verde islands around the world. , the latest compilation from New York-based reissue label Ostinato Records, explores the broad range of electrifying music that blossomed up from this small cluster of islands. Primarily consisting of guitar-and-keyboard-driven, uptempo dance music, the tracks have strong stylistic resemblances to other musical styles of the Afro-Atlantic diaspora, most notably zouk music—as well as Trinidadian soca and the bachata music of the Dominican Republic. It’s a bit different from  ’s  —more dancefloor-oriented and less psychedelic—but they’re clearly two essential peas in a pod. America Brito’s catchy and celebratory “Babylon 79” features a nimble, pulsating rhythm section a sing-songy chorus and oddly phased/flanged keyboard chords that infuse the high energy dance tune with an odd, nearly psychedelic edge. The tracks are rich with colorful instrumentation. Tulipa Negra’s masterful “Corpo Limpo” rides atop a heavy, insistent groove, while the guitar deftly comps in the background, the dynamic vocals intertwine with a cheesy but absolutely perfect toy synth/organ. Throughout the compilation’s 18 tracks, the songs of unheralded acts such as Jose Casimiro, Pedrinho and Tam Tam 2000 stand out as examples of the bright, optimistic sound of the Cape Verdean people. Expertly compiled and sequenced,  gives us a glimpse into the potent, celebratory music of a culture as it struggled to find its place in the world, wrestling with the demands of progress and reveling in the ecstasy of freedom.", "genre": []}

The trio—singer-bassist Dylan England, singer-bassist Zack Schoedel and drummer Greg McClure—often center their narratives in the brutal isolation of upstate New York. “Honey, you ought to leave your phone on when you leave Fredonia,” England implores in the opening to “Wrong Distance,” using his artful vocal phrasing to make the words “phone on” rhyme with the name of the college town. The brutal weather of the group’s Buffalo, NY home is often used as a metaphor for spiritual loneliness. “Buried under the covers/Buried under the years like the others,” a snowed-in England sings halfway through the record. Occasionally,  ventures outside the standard guitar/bass/drums formula to thrilling result. “Coast to Coast AM,” an ambient two-minute song that features programmed drums and a single repeated refrain, draws its power from minimalism.

It’s a master class at combining elements that wouldn’t work together in any other context—from the forlorn bagpipes mixed into “A Minor Life,” to Wästberg’s staccato vocal delivery on album opener “In the Mist.” (The latter, when coupled with the track’s driving bass line, has a distinct hip-hop influence.)

During its creation, he cut himself off from the news and from external distractions, in order to focus solely on writing recording. And yet the resulting album,  , is a furious, snarling beast, a record that scans as an explicit reaction to recent political developments. And while Power has always had a knack for visceral, explosive music—either with Blanck Mass, or as one half of Fuck Buttons—  ’s tracks are longer, more brooding and far more menacing than anything that’s come before. The frenzied, violent electronics of “Rhesus Negative,” which features a hard techno beat and mangled vocaloid effects, is countered by the comparative quietness of “Silent Treatment.” But even that song is shot through with shadow: taking its name from a form of manipulative punishment, there are clear hints of anger boiling just below its surface, threatening to erupt at any moment. Powers’ voice is one of the record’s crucial components. Though sometimes manipulated until they’re unrecognizable, they give the record emotional weight, providing the audience with a human element at the center of the chaos. Other times, it’s layered, for an effect that’s sometimes warm and communal and other times sharp and violent. “Hive Mind,” which closes the album, is perhaps the clearest example of the latter. Powers’ lead vocal is slow and mournful, and is eventually drowned out by a crowd of yelling voices. It’s a combination open to a variety of interpretations: Powers’ lone voice could represent the isolation that comes when a nation seems to push in a direction you don’t agree with. Or, the group vocals could represent protest—determined fights to fix a broken system. It’s an ambiguous conclusion to be sure, but a fitting end to a record that rewards and punishes in equal measure. —", "genre": []}

Now, on volume 1, Miller begins a dark new saga as  , revealing his struggle in vivid detail, and offering a “polemic yelp review of [the] American healthcare system.” Be warned: bedwetter will swiftly kill the mood at any party. Much of Miller’s aesthetic is borrowed from ‘90s Memphis horrorcore, celebrating the infernal and debauched on dollar store cassettes. His frenzied, intense delivery can sting or be wryly humorous—”stoop lights” addresses the cyclical nature of addiction while remarking “fucked up with a room with a view to a wasteland.” The album opens with a minute of televangelist chanting, followed by “man with a helmet,” a traumatic account of a kidnapping and jarring shift away from the calm intro. Bedwetter is candid about his strained mental health, and the mood transitions abruptly: on “fondly eulogizing sleep,” bedwetter displays exceptional skill at composing brooding instrumental suites before the negative vibes take over again. Just when you think things can’t get more bleak (the pinnacle is the funereal “square movement”), Miller dives deeper, cannibalizing his psyche on “Haze of Interference,” screaming “Are you happy, Travis?” The album rewards fans of Lil Ugly Mane’s Memphis-nostalgic production, and new listeners will be riveted by Miller’s nihilistic lyrics. The violence is not projected onto society, but rather the self, revealing an emotional core often absent from the macho rap music scene. Although bedwetter intentionally sets himself apart from conventional musicality, volume 1 contains enough endearing moments to craft a balanced, richly detailed caricature of the artist.

One of them is full of freaked-out, bug-eyed punk rock—like Devo on a sugar high—and the other is a collection of sun-warped folk, country, and religious music (!). Some of this sonic whipsawing is a result of the DNA: it’s a combination of the group’s early tape-only recordings and newer, more aggressive work.

Playing like a kind of LSD-doused minimalist country song, “Die” opens with a dead-eyed Horrell declaring, “First you feel its breath/ then you feel its sting/ and when it’s finally over/ you won’t feel a thing.” The song rides the same descending four-note slide guitar line over and over as a violins groans like the broken front door of a haunted house in the background. From there, the album more or less follows the old Hollywood dictum of “One for them, one for me”—one blistering, crowd-pleasing rave-up followed by an excursion into open-ended psychedelia. The lo-fi stomper “Thing” is followed by the chilling “Blood Chant,” a weirdo cultish singalong in which the group sings their own name Hare Krishna-like over rattling tambourines and loose acoustic strumming. On  , both halves of a disheveled whole work perfectly; the adrenalized charge that comes from the synth-punk rave-up “Cold Foreign Advisor” is no less satisfying than the psychotic children’s-song see-saw of “Parasite Inside.” They even work wonders when they’re playing it relatively straight: “I’m Lit” has the dirt-under-the-nails grit and leather-pants swagger of early Stooges, but is lit up by a pinwheeling keyboard line. Ultimately, the group’s stylistic grab-bag is a perfect reflection of the album’s unspoken—but deeply felt—theme: if the doomsday clock is accelerating its race to zero, you may as well try to do as many things as you can before the bell tolls. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "helm", "artist": "Album of the Day", "description": "On  , songwriter Natasha Jacobs impishly spins the virgin/whore dichotomy round like cotton candy, both embracing and discarding the duality before landing a place free of self-judgement. She extends that grace both to herself and then to the listener throughout her band’s self-titled LP. Each song is a conversation, although it’s unclear whether Jacobs is talking herself, a lover, or to us. This is part of the record’s essential charm—the uncertainty creates a funhouse of mirrors that face both outside and in. On opener “If You Let It,” Jacobs chants “You deserve more” over and over; she could be coaching a distraught listener, but she could also be repeating a mantra to herself—one of those intimate fantasy conversations you rehearse in your mind in order to steel yourself for the real thing. Like the High Priestess tarot card, Jacob’s conceals knowledge, leaving the answer up for interpretation. Taken altogether,   is about embracing the beauty and freedom of Jacobs’ own impurity, like when she declares that she “can’t sit on your white couches tonight” or teases a lover for believing she’s a “peach/ to be plucked from the wing of the tree/ ripened and ready to be consumed.” On that song, she’s a bitch, she’s a lover, etc. etc. The songs on   could fit neatly into the folk singer-songwriter tradition, but the structures are unusual, meandering melodically, augmented by vocal yips and yelps that punctuate Jacobs’ observations—call it the Newsom effect. She also employs various guitar tones and added electronic elements, a la Beth Orton, which give depth to her unusual compositions. Unlike much of the singer-songwriter canon,   is unapologetically epic and self-aggrandizing. ”Don’t let my moxie embitter your tongue,” she sings playfully on “Moxie,” a declaration of pride in her own impropriety.  Later, she sings, ”You could not give me what was mine/ Had to free my body and my mind,” as the song builds up gradually behind her, almost as if she’s ascending a grand staircase, rising above the disdain of anyone would have her hold her tongue and deny herself pleasure. “Experience made the one that you love,” she chides. Jacobs excels at clever wordplay and metaphors too intimidating to be cutesy: “This thread between us/ I can’t wind through the spool/like the knot’s caught,” she sings on “Spool,” an ode to a recalcitrant lover who can’t (or won’t) keep up. With her spritely mix of humor, passion, and unexpectedly mischievous approach to songwriting, Jacobs has created an exceptionally generous, unselfish record, an invitation to revel in its lightness of being. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Uyai", "artist": "Ibibio Sound Machine", "description": "On their  , the UK group  offered up a crazy cross-wiring of global sounds—highlife met cumbia met funk and soul—for a record that played out like a cross-generational, international dance party. For all its breathless euphoria, the record had a traditionalist’s respect for its source material, hewing closely to the original instrumentation and structures of each genre while sorting out respectful ways for them to work together. That politeness is out the window on the dizzying  , their first for  . Powered by a bevy of synths and undergirded with thumping dance rhythms, the songs on   demonstrate a greater willingness to push their source material into uncharted territory. To wit: “The Chant (Iquo Isang),” which seems to imagine Fela Kuti sitting in with Caribou; its corkscrewing guitars, bleary horn charts and giddy gang vocals are vintage Afrobeat, but they’re surrounded by searing, hot-pink synths and propelled by a wriggling electronic bassline. Ditto “The Pot is on Fire,” which takes disco to the Caribbean, steel drums clattering frantically around a polyester groove. The aptly-named “Quiet” is stark and haunting, frontwoman Eno Williams working her voice slowly through an icicle-drip guitar line. Indeed, it’s Williams who anchors the record. Her rich, authoritative vocals pilot the breathless “Power of 3,” somersaulting over its taut apostrophes of guitar; and on the frenetic, 400-miles-per-hour “Trance Dance,” where synths shoot out like sparks from a bad brake pad, it’s Williams’ assured control of the song’s slippery melody that keeps the whole thing from spinning free of its mooring. Where its predecessor impressed with its firm handle on global sounds,   is familiar enough with a host of styles to refashion them into something entirely new and entirely original.   is a breakneck, hands-in-the-air dance record, and a record where a sense of musical history is used to carve a path to the future. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Drip Mental", "artist": "Fire-Toolz", "description": "As the human experience grows increasingly entangled with technology, the idea of “sensory saturation” has gone from a minor annoyance to an everyday fact of life. Music—particularly sample-based music—reflects this; with the advent of mashups and memes, all media has become fair game for recycling and re-use, a process that, at its worst, flattens all of its source sounds, images, and ideas into an endless barrage of kitsch. On the surface, it would be easy to mistake Chicago-based electronic producer/multi-instrumentalist   for just another mashup artist. On  , her second album under the pseudonym  , Marcloid combines blood-curdling black metal howls with the kind of bubblegum synth-pop that used to soundtrack VHS workout videos in the ’80s. Yes, Marcloid plays up the contrast between those two elements for maximum absurdity, but   is more than just an orgy of stimulation. Campy and disturbing at the same time, the album illuminates, challenges, and ultimately makes art out of our relationship with media. The samples on   bob and weave in the music like loose space junk—a reverb-drenched smooth-jazz saxophone figure, courtesy of Richard Elliott, pings against an iconic riff by math metal outfit  ; a punchline delivered by cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants brushes shoulders with a spooky voice whispering “Look behind you,” a sample from a Halloween item she saw at a big box store.  creates an almost dementia-like effect by wrenching its various samples free from any context. Marcloid has been releasing music for years under a host of monikers, including ambient titles like last year’s   And while she draws from a harsher, denser palette on  , her affinity for wide-open soundscapes shines through all the abrasiveness, binding together the music’s disparate sounds. On opening track “Subconscious Pilsen Relics Pt 2 [CODENAME_AIRPLANE MODE],” Elliott’s saxophone decays into a vaporous swirl that, for a few seconds at least, aspires to the majesty of, say, Vangelis’   score. The album is just as effective when it gets ugly. Marcloid’s muffled screams of the words “I dreamt that every man who didn’t fight for me was shot” at the end of “All Deth is U [CODENAME_FINAL TOUCH LOCATION]” cut through the darkness, evoking a violent kind of anguish. It is in moments like these, or when Marcloid sings that “Guns don’t kill people unless the guns are me/ In a sea of semen a slug can still be free,” that   is at its most disturbingly provocative and, paradoxically, its most human. Throughout, Marcloid references early-’90s artifacts of internet and computer culture—a sound evoking the familiar   that once announced a new e-mail message, the fonts and the tower-style PC that grace the album cover—but she operates in a universe wholly separate from smiley-faced chiptune artists who romanticize dated media formats. As well she should. In the age of Gamergate and cyberbullying, we are too well-acquainted with the internet’s menacing underbelly to focus solely on tickling ourselves with its surface joys. Though  ‘s lens is aimed at the past, it’s hardly nostalgic. Instead, it offers stark insights into contemporary online existence.

{"album": "The World is a Loud Place", "artist": "Landlady", "description": "On its surface,   could read like a standard-issue pop-rock outfit, full of shimmery keys and charming hooks, but the band’s beating heart is its topsy-turvy time signatures and unexpected melodic curlicues. Landlady’s last LP, 2014’s  , was an energetic rock romp, but on their newest effort,   the Brooklyn ensemble is at its most polished, with sharper production and a brass section lending the songs extra muscle. Still, for all its instrumental flourishes,   doesn’t offer escapism from our noisy existence—instead, Landlady encourages emotional candor and a willingness to become radically vulnerable. Landlady starts off playing it cool. Opener “Electric Abdomen” is driven by rumbling percussion that gives way to flashy bursts of electric guitar. There are plenty of cheery moments on the record on the well—the playful “Driving in California” is one—but there’s an undercurrent of tension too, one that feels like a tacit admission that everything isn’t always rosy, even when you’re in love. “Nina,” for example, arrives as an adoring plea of devotion, with frontman Adam Schatz begging, “Nina, won’t you let me be your servant to your every breath?” He follows it with a drawn-out “Oh my God” that captures the dread, desperation, and delight of being in over your head. Restless drums toss and tumble behind guitar riffs that lurch and moan like an anxious stomach. And Schatz opens the record’s title track with an encouragement, singing “Go out of your way to be good in a world of pain/ Start at the top, then it bleeds on down the drain.” Fidgety little notes carry much of the song before a willfully unwieldy brass section joins in, sounding like a marching band heralding the end of the world. But even in the cacophony, the song doesn’t slip into doom and gloom. This approach seems to be Landlady’s songwriting sweet spot: feel happy, feel sad—just feel something. What Landlady delivers with   is a balm for the tumult of the human condition, an acknowledgement that we contain mutually inclusive multitudes that we’ll never fully untangle. The world is loud, chaotic, and increasingly terrifying, but it’s also a place where we can find wells of joy, humor, and affection. It’s the best of times and it’s the worst of times, and Landlady can see you through all of it.", "genre": []}

{"album": "E-H", "artist": "Album of the Day", "description": "The centerpiece of  , the second record from the Chicago group NE-HI, is Jason Balla’s guitar. It’s the first sound to appear on the record, cutting a jagged course across the center of album-opener “Palm of Hand,” swerving between the loose rhythm, speeding up and slowing down at will. While the band   austere post-punkers Wire as a specific influence on  , the music here has none of that group’s coldness; instead,   is—mostly—bright and upbeat, demonstrating the same grasp of light, airy melody as New Zealanders The Bats. Indeed, the gorgeous, gently-pulsing chorus of “Don’t Wanna Know You” sounds like it could have been lifted from that band’s back catalogue. That ease is especially significant given that   was born of struggle and almost sandbagged by overthinking. The band’s rising profile in their home city caused principal songwriters Balla and Mikey Wells to panic, concerned their writing wasn’t matching the increased attention. But instead of doubling-down on that anxiety, on  , the band moves in the other direction, letting songs unfold slowly and deliberately. The haunting, slow-build title track moves from a simple nest of guitars to a big, churning finale, Wells and Balla stretching a single sung note as the band heaves away behind them. “Everybody Warned You” is a tender, sad-eyed ballad that clears out its middle section for a twirling, melodic guitar solo. Even the album’s tenser moments put the guitar way out front—the pogo-ing “Prove,” which recalls the nervous energy of early Parquet Courts, bounces on a taut coil of guitar. They even manage to make the album’s few moments of darkness sound optimistic. On the bitter music-industry kiss-off “Buried on the Moon,” a leaping guitar lead offsets the acid in the song’s chorus: “Come on, make a record like your dear old dad/ We’ll give you all the money and make you feel sad.”   may be the product of that Faustian deal, but the results are anything but melancholy. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Sunbelt Emptiness", "artist": "Pollen RX", "description": "On their 2015 EP  , Austin’s   (then a trio) skewered heavy topics like supply-side economics, marketing tactics, and institutional racism over upbeat garage pop. They’re no less political on  , their first full-length, but in the time since   they’ve both added a member and become more sophisticated in tone. It was a wise move; while   ‘shouty-dancey’ approach plays well with the converted, a pointed message packs greater punch when delivered in a way that invites close listening.   is dense and meticulous, balancing melodic hooks with slinkier passages so skillfully that it’s easy to get lost in the music before realizing you’re grooving to a song about AK-47s. The album telegraphs some of its intentions in its cover art, a neon pastiche of a solitary eye peering out over an endless stretch of oil wells and telephone lines. It’s like a Lisa Frank illustration of Fitzgerald’s Valley of Ashes in  . In Pollen RX’s songs, the world is baked by the sun, frozen by air conditioning, patrolled by authorities, populated by pre-fab housing and, on opening track “Billboard Promises,” full of ads offering relief in the form of lotto winnings and sleeping pills.   is about what happens when a country exhausts its resources (“Sand in the Well.”) “Sunbelt emptiness/ American design,” Maud Morgan sings on the title track; according to PollenRX, this national vacuum is no accident. To put it another way: it’s not a bug, it’s a feature. However dystopian the lyrics, the music remains bright, bouncy, and catchy. Propulsive pop number  “Again” is about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion; on the aforementioned title track, co-vocalists Morgan and Ben Hirsch alternate between high-register yelping and gravelly growls while darkly juxtaposing the plasticity of reality TV with flickering images of environmental disasters. Consumerism, both its temptations and its disappointments, is another prime target: “Packaging” (which first appeared on  ) is a whip-smart critique of brand-as-narrative that bares its fangs in the chorus: “Here’s a story/ See if you can sell it/ Truth is nothing /packaging is everything.” Despite their dissatisfaction with the world around them, Pollen RX is still able to find light in the cracks. “Paper plates on the kitchen floor/ but I adore you,” sings Morgan sweetly on “Apartment,” a song that’s heartbreaking in its elucidation of how small dreams can shrink, but still have meaning. By the time the album winds down with the dream-like “Control,” the band has found a kind of peace in their environment: “The sand and the sun and you all alone.” For all their vitriol, Pollen RX have no illusions about their own complicity in the evils they attack. On   they indict themselves in the sad and often violent processes that make the modern way of life possible as often as they do the listener.

Yet, no matter how disparate the styles, the record never sounds disjointed. Instead, it’s held together by the band’s well-honed melodic sensibilities and their obvious familiarity with and reverence for each genre’s individual conventions—all of which they fold seamlessly into their own bright and shiny sound. The bell-clear vocals of bassist Rose Vastola are a highlight throughout, recalling the bubbly yet sharply-defined tenor of fellow Floridian Allison Mosshart.  may be an easy listen, but underneath all the ear candy is a record of serious substance. The heart of   is centered on the quiet peace that comes after illusions have been shattered, and the acceptance that comes from facing adversity head on. “Never knowing what I’m doing tears me apart,” Vastola sings on opener “Wasting Away”; by the time the band arrives at the title track, she has found a kind of stillness in sitting alone amidst the wreckage of a bad situation now overcome. “I am grateful for the past and all the friends didn’t last,” she sings, lingering over the litany of experiences that have shaped her current situation while expressing gratitude for the sun that “shines through my glass home.” It’s not melancholy so much as wistful and, ultimately, wise—a song that celebrates the serenity that comes from battles hard fought and lessons well learned on a record that embraces the evergreen enchantment of three chords going around and around and around. —", "genre": []}

It’s fitting because Baldi has always traded in propulsive, pound-the-steering wheel aggression.

Those impulses led to records (particularly 2012’s breakout  that announced Baldi’s raw talent and his natural feel for punk-inspired power pop, but that were ultimately buried under too much chaotic noise and dissonance.

A fearless cult figure in New England’s underground scene who’s dabbled in everything from hardcore death spasms ( ) to rough comedy routines to completely confounding ‘rock music’ (Preggy Peggy & the Lazy Babymakers), the singer/instrument swapper has been on a creative tear lately. In November she released  , a solo effort split between studio experiments and well-aged   cuts that’s about as accessible as Sawyer gets. Proceed with patience, however, as nothing is quite as it seems here. Take “Yaadon Ki Baaraat,” for instance. While Sawyer’s pitchy voice sounds like Joanna Newsom after huffing a couple helium tanks, the track itself is actually quite catchy—what happens when a mad genius covers a classic Bollywood theme with flipped bottle caps and a scuffed Bruno Nicolai sample. A ukelele-led live rendition of “Run Angel Run” is even more engrossing—stunning, even—as it leads the Tammy Wynette tune down an otherworldly road that’s haunting and heartbreaking. Wild-eyed originals like “Will There Be Yodeling in Heaven,” “Millicent Bell” and “The Knife I Carry” are creepy, sure, but they’re also hard to look away from, thanks to Sawyer’s innate grasp of no-fi songwriting, everyday instruments (when was the last time you heard sleeping bags   vitamin bottles on a record?), and rudimentary effects. Remember when everyone thought the Moldy Peaches were as awesome as the Strokes and the White Stripes? Sawyer evokes that anti-folk era by sounding like she’s in the   with nothing to lose, especially on  .

{"album": "hannels: “Backpfeifengesicht/Airstrip One", "artist": "Album of the Day", "description": "Unlike other metropolises, it’s not terribly easy to find lifelong natives of the Washington, D.C. area. Part of that is because of the gentrification process that’s squeezing so many out of rent they were once able to afford. But, also—growing up in and around the nation’s capital exerts a strange and particular pressure. The industry in D.C. is pretty much purely politics and its associated supports (universities included), and as such can feel suffocating. Those who arrive for jobs with rotating administrations, lobbying organizations, and think tanks rarely interact with anyone outside their circles, skimming along the city’s surface. Channels is comprised of three individuals who know this peculiar world intimately—the notorious   ( , Burning Airlines, many production and engineering credits) and bassist Janet Morgan (of  , also Robbins’ wife), who currently live in Baltimore, and drummer Darren Zentek ( ,  ), who is still in D.C. proper. And so, their anti-Trump Inauguration protest 7-inch, “Backpfeifengesicht/Airstrip One,” feels more natural and less opportunistic than many other political statements. Even when addressing entirely personal matters, and even in the poetic, playful lyrical abstractions with which Robbins often works, there’s politics in the water. “Backpfeifengesicht”—a word which can be translated from the German as “a face in need of a slap”—is as direct an indictment of Trump as possible. It goes from the sort of roiling, percussive noise rock this crew is known for (dual vocals from Robbins and Morgan urgent, overlapping) to chiming pop luxury at the flip of a dime, seeking the humanity of a man with seemingly no empathy. “Airstrip One,” a tense little jam that works expertly with post-punk negative space (particularly when it comes to Morgan’s vocal lines), locates the terror of losing ground that exists at the heart of xenophobia, fascism, and nationalism (“Who was holding all the gold in that Golden Age?”). It asks of those it critiques: “Were you fighting for the right side? Did you throw away your lifeline? Did you wake up on the wrong side of a burning bed?” As Robbins repeats those words, and as the song sharpens into punk glass, there is honest passion and power in his voice—grit, if you will. Resolve. “Backpfeifengesicht/Airstrip One” is also the first new Channels material in a decade; adult responsibilities, including complicated healthcare for Robbins and Morgan’s son Callum, who was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, made bringing the group together regularly too challenging for a time. There is an ease to these two complicated, coiled-up songs, a sort of effervescence that pushes through even in the most pointed moments; the band is obviously having a   playing with one another. This is reportedly only the first new material from Channels’ second life, and hallelujah for that. If all political gauntlet-throwing felt this resonant, we might just pull through.", "genre": []}

But because the mainstream club scene can often feel unsafe for non-conforming or marginalized people, the existence of an alternative network of venues becomes crucial. The Ghost Ship, the Oakland venue destroyed by fire in December, was one of those spaces.   is a fundraising compilation that aims to raise up and honor the outsiders who lost their lives in that fire, by raising funds for the Gray Area Foundation For The Arts and the Trans Assistance Project. It was,  , “one of the deadliest structure fires in the United States in the last decade,” an inferno that gutted the local arts community as much as the building itself.

Since then, the band spent several years touring the country, and several more resting in Canada as they retreated from their status as indie guitar-music saviors. Much has stayed the same on  , the band’s third album. Like its predecessor, it also contains eight songs, many of which still run in the four-minute range, and most of which still deal with, in one form or another, negotiating compromised dreams and early-middle aged adult restlessness. There are scattered new musical approaches, though: more acoustic guitar, some synths here and there, a new reliance on slower tempos, and a seven-plus minute progrock epic called “Arc of Bar.” Singer/guitarist Brian King and drummer-vocalist Dave Prowse still have a way of instilling magic with not much more than a few chords and some earnest romanticism: “A whirlwind, a woman and a famous feeling” is how they put it on “No Known Drink or Drug,” one of many songs on   that sets forth an altogether new thesis for Japandroids: that dedication to a future of long-term love can be just as thrilling and worthy of sing-along celebration as bemoaning what once was. On the album-closer “In a Body Like a Grave,” the band further embraces its newfound maturity, channeling Springsteen with an anthem of communal resilience that extols the hard work of persisting through the dark troubles life inevitably throws your way. At some point, the song seems to say, we’ll all have to recover some long-buried faith: “Gather the gang, and make that night,” King sings, “an ultimatum to the universe: fuck or fight.” —", "genre": []}

Fla.mingo’s debut album, is the rare example of a record where the line between vaporwave and another genre—in this case, synth pop—is almost completely annihilated. The New York-based producer seamlessly melds the two to create a powerful ode to lost innocence, youth, and love. It all starts sweetly, with openers “Fantasy” and “Everything Felt So Right” recalling the sugary bubble-gum optimism of Fla.mingo’s August EP  . But the album quickly pivots to wistfulness and stays there, using brooding synths and distant vocal samples on  tracks like “浮く” and “Heartache2” to evoke a wounded, broken romanticism. The keening, high-pitched electronics that end “Die”—as well as the echoing, spaced-out textures of “Depression Dive”—perfectly illustrate this emotion,  the far-off vocals pining after some departed love.

It’s recorded and mastered evenly and professionally, as would be expected from an official release, but there’s nothing about it that sounds sterile. You can hear Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein moving to and away from their microphones, and there are some very natural moments, as when Tucker struggles to get all her lyrics in without losing any ferocity on “What’s Mine is Yours,” a breathless ode to love as subversive energy from 2005’s  , which sounds far more vital here than its studio version. Both her and Brownstein’s voices have ragged edges by the time they get to the blown-out bridge. Janet Weiss’ performance throughout the entire record should silence any rogue naysayers who don’t think she’s one of America’s best rock drummers—powerful and precise, Weiss keeps up a pace that’d have most gasping midway through the set, injecting the occasional sly, jazzy curlicue or syncopated part with fluid ease. This is not a set that rests or lopes along. It’s hard, tense, and aggressive, but it also bubbles with ebullience—Sleater-Kinney at their best. The setlist is pretty evenly divided throughout their discography—several tracks from  , and  , as well as a smattering of nostalgic selections from  ,  , and a stunning version of “Start Together,” from 1999’s  . It serves just as easily as a terrific introduction to Sleater-Kinney’s discography and ethos as it does as a treat for longtime fans.

It’s not too surprising—he began hinting at this approach as far back as 2012’s  . And while   may leave some fans yearning for the immediate gratification of Marion’s gargantuan, shrieking guitar work, the payoff here is much greater. Marion rarely sings on his records; instead, he uses a wide range of tones and effects to turn his electric guitar—often played with a slide—into a voice of its own. On past albums, Marion used drums, keyboards and other guitars to create a neutral backdrop for his soaring riffs. On  , those other instruments move to the forefront, melding seamlessly with Marion’s guitar on tracks like “Tomorrow” and “Swimming” for a sturdier, more balanced sound. On the album’s second side in particular, sweet, humid piano figures provide a smart and gentle counterpoint to Marion’s quivering notes. Which is not to say that  is a sleepy affair. Opening track “Animals” channels the psych-y swirl of past tour mates Tame Impala, and the blasting “Cartoon Rock,” true to its name, is an unabashed roller-coaster of crunching riffs that bears a delightful resemblance to Deerhoof’s recent  . Generally less giddy than its predecessors,  catches a spectacular—and highly underrated—craftsman discovering that sometimes mellowing out, if only a little bit, can be the best way to create suspense. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "DJ Kicks (Matthew Dear)", "artist": "Matthew Dear", "description": "“The rhythms of the world are so much better than rhythms which are intentionally created,” Matthew Dear once said in   with Scottish magazine  . “There’s a tempo in everything—you can just loop it.” If only things were that simple. While Dear claims he has countless hours of raw material lying around, the process of putting it all together—of turning madness into music—often takes years. That goes for everything from his feral techno guise   to the avant-pop albums Dear cuts under his own name. Nearly five years have passed since the last one ( ), with little indication of that lull ending anytime soon. In the meantime, Dear has snuck a lone new track into his mix for the  series. Lurking near the starting gate, right after a pensive   piece, is “Wrong With Us,” an exclusive that questions everything. “As time goes on, I don’t know what more we can do,” Dear sings over one of his signature melancholic dance melodies. “The world keeps changing, but when has that ever been news?” A fair question, but it doesn’t take long for Dear to brush it off and dive headlong into bonkers tracks like  ‘s ravishing Caserta remix, Decius’ sinister “Bread & Butter” single, and a cold-pressed collab between Doc Daneeka and Gwilym Gold (“Lust For Sale”). Like any DJ worth his weight in wax, Dear knows exactly how to manipulate our mood. But his ultimate goal isn’t to cause anxiety about the State of Things. It’s pure, unadulterated escapism—right down to a fireworks finale of chain-linked Audion cuts and a DJ Khalab song featuring Malian singer Baba Sissoko that slows everything down and brings the 66-minute set to a beautiful close. ”I wanted to create a mix that could be listened to anywhere,” Dear explained in a press release earlier this year, “and reflect a little bit of everything that I play. Whether you’re in your car, preparing to open the club, or having a bottle of wine with friends at home, this mix is for you.” —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Occult Architecture Vol. 1", "artist": "Moon Duo", "description": ", the duo of Ripley Johnson and Sanae Yamada, have preached alternative gospel since their debut LP,  , released on Woodsist in 2010. For  , their fourth studio album for Sacred Bones Records, the duo fled the weather-less consistency of Southern California and returned to their hometown of Portland, Oregon to record. There, Ripley and Yamada found great beauty in the coming and going of the seasonal cycle, and divided   into two parts. The first actively engages with the darkest recesses of winter.   is full of pummeling electro-punk, feisty and edgy yet also containing a certain warmth—like a steaming cup of coffee on a freezing morning—as is the case on album standout “Creepin.” Ripley’s melodies are paramount to Moon Duo’s sound, relying more on aesthetic and melody than lyrical craft. Simplicity is Moon Duo’s not-so-secret weapon. Their tracks blend the familiar concoction of guitars, a bevy of synthesizers, vocals and drum machines (helmed by touring drummer John Jeffrey). Yet their music never feels stale. Their sound exists beneath layers of haze, each acutely defined as to not overwhelm any particular part. “Will of the Devil” is a spooky midnight jam, with skyward reaching ‘80s synths and a stomping drum pattern that wouldn’t sound out of place at an NBA game.   is music for cold nights and grey mornings. The band embraces darkness rather than wallowing in it. And if all of this darkness is just too much for you? Well, springtime is right around the corner. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Desvio Onirico", "artist": "Boogarins", "description": "The greatest strength of the Brazilian band Boogarins is the way, in each of their songs, they’re able to generate a thick haze of psychedelia without ever blotting out the melody. Like Os Mutantes—a group to which they bear more than a passing musical resemblance—the group’s songs are constructed around simple, urgent refrains, over which they add layers upon layers of wavy, wobbling guitar. That skill becomes all the more pronounced in the live setting, as   clearly demonstrates. Over the course of the album’s running time, the group stretches songs out to the 10-minute-mark and beyond, but never disappears into a wormhole of tuneless improvising. Take the sprawling “Tempo”: the song opens with a post-rock stutter-and-stall, its arch, angular rhythmic construction supporting sheets of feedback and amp fuzz. Gradually, the din dies away to make room for a gentle, whispery vocal melody that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Stereolab record. The song folds in on itself halfway through, wooshes of guitar and clattering drums threatening to topple the sense of tranquility. But then, just as quickly as the kaleidoscope of noise began, everything snaps back into focus, the melody returns, and the song is guided safely to shore. “Manchaca” is a loose, ambling sci-fi funk jam, with robotic synths squawking around a firmly-rooted bassline. The band works a single groove over the course of the song’s 12 minutes, the additional elements—wah-wah guitar, pin-prick synths—never shaking the surefooted rhythm. As an introduction to the group’s music,   works beautifully; it’s an entryway into the strange palace of Boogarins, filled with hundreds of winding passageways, all of which lead to the same beautiful destination. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Pur", "artist": "Egyptrixx", "description": "On his fourth full-length album, Egyptrixx, a.k.a. Toronto-based ambient techno producer David Psutka, continues to push away from electronic dance music and into a less definable space between bass music, dark ambient, and New Age atmospheres. The music on   (Psutka’s second release on his own Halocline Trance label) is interwoven with field recordings of water flowing—the light babble of a stream emptying into a pool, waves steadily cascading onto shore. “Lake of Contemplation, Pool of Fundamental Bond” and “We Can Be Concrete” create a two-song suite of metallic clangs and oscillating mechanics patterned after the organic movement of a river’s rapids or an ocean’s tide. That’s not to say, though, that these pieces sound anything like their organic corollaries—Psutka’s intention is to recode the universal rhythms of earth in binary. The mechanical gloom and static compression of the first three pieces finally breaks with the title track, a balladic centerpiece with a sort of synthesized brooding core—a slow jam for cyborgs. It’s followed by “V.E.P.N.” which descends into a rainstorm of thunderous distortion and feedback while maintaining and reintroducing sonic elements drawn from the rest of the album. This use of recurring themes is a bold and striking demonstration of Psutka’s sensitivity to the details of composition—not as common today in the digital age as it was at a time when an album’s physical form implied a certain necessary cohesion.  is computer music rendered to soundtrack a modern technological dystopia, a cold sci-fi futurism that is no longer so chronologically nebulous. Egyptrixx recasts the terror and alienation that Philip K. Dick, John Brunner, and Ray Bradbury speculated about and, in the end, becomes one with the machine.", "genre": []}

{"album": "Messes", "artist": "Stef Chura", "description": "On first listen, the debut album from Michigan’s   scans as a blown-out celebration of rock’s basic building blocks—guitar, drums, bass, vocals, and heart. The secret weapon, though, is Chura’s seen-it-all twang and her unpredictable song structures; they give her lyrics—which are often as brief as bathroom-wall aphorisms—a cutting edge. The spare “Thin,” which pairs Chura’s voice with bare-bones guitar and percussion, consists of a single verse; its central metaphor: the scratch-off surface of a lottery ticket. The glum “You” chronicles the narrator’s longing, circular admiration for someone distant, with the chiming guitars becoming more intense as Chura’s vocal blossoms slowly from sulk into yawp. On the title track, sullen guitar melodies arise from Pigpen-cloud riffs, until a multitracked Chura swoops in with words of comfort, centering the chaos. Chura’s brand of close-to-the-bone pop is intimate yet triumphant, bringing to mind the likes of Holly Golightly and Kristin Hersh. Her songs are ways out of emotional jams, with intricate guitar lines and unexpected left turns both tracing her feelings driving her poetry. It’s hardly bedroom lo-fi. Instead, the reverb on tracks like the wistful “Human Being” and the jittery “Spotted Gold” give the album the feeling of an frantic car ride, one where the destination isn’t a  , but a clearer, more assured sense of self. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Late Nights & Heartbreak", "artist": "Hannah Williams", "description": ", the sophomore album from Hannah Williams, marks the official arrival of the British vocal powerhouse. With a top-notch band, the Affirmations, behind her—and a renewed commitment to the soul sound re-popularized by artists like   and  , Williams has carved out a deep, strong groove. Williams’ confidence radiates throughout  , but nowhere is it more evident than in her vocal approach. Her gritty tone on “Fighting Your Shadow” contrasts smartly with her backup vocalists’ sweetness, while the palpable urgency in her cover of “Dazed and Confused” harkens back to the biting original by the American songwriter and jingle writer Jake Holmes. Throughout  , Williams’ band matches her bombast ounce for ounce; the guitars fly by weightlessly, making liberal use of the wah pedal, and the bass lines—particularly on tracks like “Fighting Your Shadow” and the glitzy “Ain’t Enough”—hit like a sucker punch. Yet even with its walloping blasts of sound, some of the album’s strongest moments are its most subdued. On “In Your Arms,” Williams sings with a sugary sweetness that offers a salient counterpoint to her scathing howl, and album closer “Your Luck Can Change” evokes the elegance of Sam Cooke. These moments don’t merely capture Williams’ versatility, but remind us, thrillingly, that we can’t be too sure what she will tackle next. —", "genre": []}

{"album": "Remain Calm", "artist": "Mica Levi and Oliver Coates", "description": "The role of classical instruments in electronic music is shifting, and Mica Levi and Oliver Coates are at the forefront of that movement. For years now, the instrumentalists have explored a possible marriage between classical and new electronic forms, pushing deeper into unexplored territory with each release. Oliver’s   at times veered into cello-driven dance music, while Mica Levi’s  soundtrack went the other way—into creepy, visceral and atmospheric territory. On their new collaborative album  , Levi and Coates unite, and blend cellos with various electronic elements, samples and instrumentals, creating 13 nuanced snippets with their specific sound. At times,   nods to contemporary genres like grime, drone, and techno, but the musicians do a masterful job of blending the live instruments into the mix, weaving esoteric twists throughout the album. The cello is the project’s main focus, and on songs like “Pre-Barok,” “Dolphins Climb Onto Shore For The First Time,” and “New Wren Kitch,” the instrument feels especially warm, albeit portraying its different qualities in each of the tracks. The highlight is “Barok Main,” an abstract composition full of capricious melodic lines and fluctuating atmospheres. Moments of comfort are met with bone-chilling stillness.

{"album": "Early Volume", "artist": "Slug", "description": "There’s never been anything even remotely approachable about Slug, the L.A. noise band that exploded onto the scene in a hail of distortion and feedback in the late ‘80s. They staged deliberately-deafening impromptu concerts outside at Loyola Marymount University, where the members of the band were working as radio DJs, and slowly built a catalog of music with guitars that sounded like breaking glass and basslines that undulated and howled like the sandworms in  . But time has a funny way of sanding the edges of bands that once seemed confrontational. Music that felt oppressive two decades ago now wouldn’t sound out of place in commercial hip-hop songs, and some of the ‘80s most extreme genres—industrial music, in particular—now sound quaint and kitschy. Not so with Slug: the 18 songs that make up this collection still feel like repeated right-hooks from a studded boxing glove. Slug has no use for melody: “Freak of Nature” pits a preacher’s ranting and raving against guitars that groan like the failing engine on an old Camaro. The song bludgeons with repetition: the same pitch black four-note chord pattern buzzsaws over and over and over—like the noise rock version of water torture. “Elevator,” the closest thing on the record to a “single,” takes the notion of industrial music literally, with rhythms that sound like they’re being beaten out on hubcaps and guitars that are all feedback, no tone. And “Pink Party Dessert” hits the gut like a cement medicine ball, 400-ton guitars whaling away at the same note  . The closest analogue would be the similarly-maniacal anarcho-noise of New York’s Missing Foundation, but the fact that Slug keep halfheartedly feinting toward conventional pop structures—a chorus here, a middle eight there—makes their music feel more subversive, as if they’re providing us with entryways just to destroy them. Slug deconstruct rock the way demolition crews bring down hotels: with explosive force and heavy machinery. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Vol. 1", "artist": "Permit", "description": "Barreling from start to finish in less time than it takes to brew a pot of coffee,   from Indiana duo Permit crams a truckload of hooks into songs the size of a Smart car. Not one of them crosses the two-minute mark, and that’s to the record’s great benefit: rocketing from verse to chorus and back again, Permit have figured out the trick to writing pop songs is to double-down on the melody; everything else is just window dressing. A side project of Drew Auscherman of Hoops, Permit trades that band’s laid-back, meditative indie-rock for power and velocity. “Track #1” (apparently, they don’t have time for song titles either) revs up hiccupping anxiety pop to light speed, guitars jittering away frantically vocals morose and mournful. “I’m having trouble moving on,” goes the chorus, just a few seconds before the band does just that. “Track #2” shrinks the swagger of Thin Lizzy-style radio rock to thimble size, the blistering riffs sounding so synthetic they could soundtrack   Even though the songs are compact, they still find space to spread out: “Track #4” is laced up with a boot-stomping country-fried guitar riff, and the whispery, subdued vocal melody on “Track #6” contrasts beautifully with the blown-out, in-the-red instrumentation.  ’s 11th hour release date makes it the perfect salve for an often wearying year: turn off your brain, turn up the volume; repeat as necessary. —", "genre": []}

Crump’s also been fond of duo projects, like his vibrant outing with saxophonist   and a long-running combo with guitarist   called  . But when he composed a collection of pieces in the wake of his brother’s death from an aggressive sarcoma, he imagined a different sound, one that cleaved more closely to jazz traditions. He assembled a strong, versatile quartet for  , enlisting the magnificent, polystylistic drummer  —whom he’s often worked with alongside Iyer—and two horn players that he yearned to play with; the exciting young trumpeter Adam O’Farrill and the veteran tenor saxophonist Ellery Eskelin. The keyboard-free combo brings a delicious airiness to the pieces Crump wrote, all of which allow the players considerable creative latitude and aural space. With the opening track “NoD for Nelson,” a piece that suggests a blues progression but with a sly chordal substitution, the band achieves the leader’s intended effect of saluting the great composer and arranger Oliver Nelson, with its hint of “Stolen Moments.” The group swings hard through the tricky melody of “Skippaningam,” opening up for some terrific multi-linear improvisation by the horn players, who blow terse phrases that dance around one another with preternatural intimacy. Given the loose funk groove Sorey imparts to “Esquima Dream,” it’s surprising to know that it’s the one piece here that was originally composed for Rosetta Trio, because its stabbing horn parts seem tailor-made for this combo. The two-part closer “Pulling Pillars—Outro for Patty” delivers a meditative farewell; solemn, spiritual, and, ultimately, celebratory.", "genre": []}

The boom of a kick drum, or the Steve Reichian marimba pulses, or the clang of a tuning fork, brusquely bring you back to center whenever your attention wanders. That seems to have been at least partially Tignor’s intention with this record, too; the accompanying notes claim that it was written and performed to help listeners “transcend and reclaim ourselves from the noise of public living.” Hyperbolic as that might sound, it provides a fine framework through which to appreciate this collection. Through its peaks of volume and bouts of dissonance, the album works well as a bulwark against the ambient clatter of everyday life. Beyond that, there’s the sheer technical mastery on display in  .

The album has an almost classic vaporwave sound, full of hallucinogenic soundscapes, video game homages, and woozy synthesizers. While this might make it seem somewhat unoriginal, Equip pulls it off; each track is a fully fleshed-out progression of articulate melodies and engrossing chords. It’s a transportive and ethereal release, but also one that may sound reassuringly familiar to acolytes of the genre. The 25 tracks create the sense of a return to some primal state of peace—perhaps in this case, the ‘90s. They take some of the most blissfully tranquil and transportive synth-based music the genre has produced in some time, and they conjure otherworldly atmospheres. This mixture of floating, spacey music with a subtle vibe of familiarity has the effect of transforming  into something of an enjoyable contradiction. Have we heard such dreamy trips as “Reunited” and “D r u i d s [Encounter]” before, or is their welcoming aura simply a deception intended to hide how their alienness might change us from within? Their reverb-laden keys and 8-bit chirping fail to make the answer to this question any clearer since, even though they recall everything from ’80s sci-fi to ’90s video games, they slot their elements into tight, progressive compositions that end up being more than the sum of their parts. also ends up sounding like more than a debut. Rather than giving the impression of inexperience or rash over-exuberance, beatific songs like “D U N G E O N” and “Identity” stand as near-masterful balances of journeying melodies and weightless ambience.

Like   or Ólafur Arnalds’   project, Löffler’s take on minimal techno is as redolent of nature as it is of the club, his tracks turning watercolor melodies and muted rhythms into soundscapes of stark, windswept beauty.

Using a portable microphone to capture found sounds and sample his surroundings, Löffler has woven the natural environment deep into the record’s fabric. He loops the sound of struck wood into shuffling percussion on “Lid” and juxtaposes field recordings with organic instruments, like the marimba and mandolin zither. Löffler lends his shy vocal to a number of tracks, notably a small reverie titled “Pacific.” But Monha of the Hamburg-based band Me Succeeds—who first collaborated with Löffler on his debut album, A Forest—returns for four tracks, and her halting refrains on “Wildnerness” and “Vind” count amongst Mare’s most plainly lovely moments.

Its songs morph as surprisingly as the color clouds in   or   for his excellent 2014 collaboration with astrophysicist/saxophonist Stephon Alexander,  . The primary theme across the Brooklyn producer’s full-length solo debut,  , is combative rhythmic interplay: Trap beats become stuttering free-jazz improvisations (“Aphasia”), then degrade into system-overload digital hardcore (“Synapse”) and haunted two-step (“Prime Matter”). There are nods to ambient and process music, too; single “Unfamiliar Cloud” explores the overlap between the piano licks that drive Radiohead’s recent “Daydreaming” and the stratified rhythmic interplay of Steve Reich. Throughout, Rioux’s smudged, reticent vocals — think a hoarser, more funereal Owen Pallett—drift in the middle of the mix. In polyglottish music like this, it’s easy for the disparate stylistic elements to cancel out a clear artistic signature. But Rioux distinguishes himself by making his thirst for staking out uncharted territory infectious.   isn’t ‘Like Nothing You’ve Ever Heard Before,’ but it’s just surprising enough.

The 10 track names correspond with their sequence on the album—it opens with “First, Consider the Lillies,” ends on “The 10 Sultans Of Rudyard (Moo Moo Mix).” Yet despite the mischievous glints audible throughout (and visible in the title),  isn’t a silly record. Older and less prone to pure goofiness, Paterson and Fehlmann here make the icy keyboard lines and deep-echoing horns of “Wireless MK2,” and the gently chopped-up orchestra of “7 Oaks” seem both modest and effulgent. This is the Orb’s most genuinely ambient album, and the timing of its release, in the midst of massive global tensions, is especially fortuitous. That’s the case even as they nod slyly to their own past, as on the album’s highlight, “9 Elms Over River Eno (Channel 9).” With its CB-radio voice samples and twinkling minimalist loop, it’s an update of the ingredients that made the Orb’s first big hit, “Little Fluffy Clouds.” But the mission has changed, from chilling out as a break from dancing to chilling out as a break from a world that requires one. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Bhavachakra", "artist": "Bhavachakra", "description": "In Buddhism, bhavachakra represents the cyclical nature of existence. The Mahayana Buddhists believe the symbol was invented by Buddha himself as a way to help people understand his teachings. The (primarily) black metal band of the same name explore similar themes. Their compositions are cyclical; they spin like wheels, with guitar riffs spiraling inward toward blistering rhythms and sermon-like vocals. While blast beats and turmoil reign supreme across  , there’s order amidst the chaos. There may be full-on anarchy in “Oceans of Existence,” but the more atmospheric moments, on tracks like “The Burden of Attachment” and “Sybaritic Apparitions,” provide not only structure but relief. Intense, Liszt-like piano passages on “Prelude,” and flamenco guitar on “Rivers of Transmigration,” collide with the technical instrumental brilliance of “Untitled.” Bhavachakra’s musical interests are far-reaching, and their songs are large enough to contain them all. Throughout the record, Bhavachakra use confusion, discordance and disarray to explore dualism, human existence, and the death of the planet. But what’s most remarkable is that, for all its force and power, it never feels hindered by the genre’s constraints. Rather, it uses those techniques as a foundation to establish a cyclical work of art, one that weaves together technique, skill, philosophy, and pure guts. —", "genre": []}

He makes that concept clear from the jump: The cover sports an animated locomotive with TBG hanging from its left side, and two song titles—“A Train is Coming,” “Come With Me and Fly”—reference travel. The journey is musical as well; on “This One Is For The Ladies And The Gents,” TBG and trumpeter Miles Bonny bridge the gap between J Dilla and Sade, offering a mellow vibe with adequate knock.

{"album": "Soundscapes for the Emotional​-​Type Listener", "artist": "Slow Attack Ensemble", "description": "You’d think ambient music would be the last style ever to break the fourth wall. Ambient, after all, is about dissolving into the moment, about being enveloped by pure atmosphere. Occasionally, an artist will nudge and wink at the self-seriousness of the whole phenomenon, even as they indulge in its vaporous fullness. That was certainly  ’s approach, beginning with the self-referential (and mildly self-deprecating) title of 2001’s  ; on 2007’s  , as they sunk even more deeply into gauzily narcotic arrangements for guitars, strings, and endless reverb, their titles catapulted into the full-on absurd: “Another Ballad for Heavy Lids,” “The Mouthchew,” “December Hunting for Vegetarian Fuckface.” Slow Attack Ensemble’s  —the work of a Canadian musician named Chuck Blazevic—bears a similar tongue-in-cheek approach. Perhaps not coincidentally, Blazevic’s earlier work under the   alias sounded quite a bit like Stars of the Lid.   purported to capture “the elegiac dimensions” of American popular music in the years between ’50s and ’60s rock, though in practice, that goal mostly translates to endless echo and fathomless yearning. (If you’ve heard any of those songs that have been slowed 800 percent that have made their way around the internet, Dreamsploitation also sounds a lot like those.) His new album also tackles a specific style and a specific era, but this time, it actually sounds like its subject. In an email, Blazevic told me that the album is “heavily inspired by the more minimal and organic elements of 1980s Japanese and Mediterranean ambient-electronic music.” Mixing piano, electric guitar, synthesizer, and copious amounts of reverb, the album could easily be mistaken for the real thing. Like the best ambient music, it fades unobtrusively into the background, but there’s just enough there to hold your attention, if you should feel so inclined—what Brian Eno meant when he said that ambient music should be “as ignorable as it is interesting.” Though it’s just 23 minutes long, the album covers an ambitious amount of ground without ever losing focus. The opening “November, 1st in Detroit” nicely captures the album’s simple-but-complex qualities by setting a handful of elements—string plucks, airy synthesizer pads, the slightest hint of marimba—in lazy circulation, drifting in and out of phase like tape loops running in parallel. The shifting pulses are reminiscent of the tide lapping against boats in the harbor, and a fluid bass solo offers the album’s most melodic moment. On “Mizue,” there’s a hint of Harold Budd in the watery piano, while “Elegy for Elodie” takes a more hypnotic approach, running simple piano patterns through multiple delays until their movements resemble the rings left by raindrops in a pond. The album’s second half is more electronic, with quiet synthesizer melodies framed in gentle ambience. An echo of Cocteau Twins’ pristine guitar tone ripples through “After Images,” and the sound of rushing water accompanies the optimistic tones of the closing “Landscape of Perpetual Oblivion.” The most tantalizing of all, though, is the penultimate track, “Bells”—a 43-second sketch of synthesizer that transports you to the snowy courtyard of an ancient temple in a small, distant village. There’s no breaking the fourth wall here; as brief as it may be, the illusion is total. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Between Waves", "artist": "The Album Leaf", "description": "It’s been roughly two decades since Jimmy LaValle entered the music world, performing in groups like Tristeza, GoGoGo Airheart, and even The Locust, that lovable group of costumed new-wave/power-violence weirdos. It’s hard to imagine LaValle donning a skin-tight nylon suit these days, but his vibrant history of world-building still informs the music of his current project,  . On their new album  , these worlds take a multitude of forms, each one as engrossing as the next.  is The Album Leaf’s sixth studio album and first for Relapse, after a run of full-lengths for Sub Pop and a string of soundtrack work and collaborations. While the once-solo project has long since turned into a group effort, this album is the first to be recorded and produced with an entire band. And it shows: The Album Leaf no longer sound like an augmented LaValle endeavor; the newly-minted band vigorously guides the Rhodes-driven melodies and fleshes out the post-rock dynamics with ambient synths and keyboards, driving percussion, and swelling trumpet work for music that’s at once celebratory and solemn, evocative and present. But The Album Leaf’s articulation of presence has always been dependent on a wholesale subscription to Western harmonic conventions in order to fulfill its life-affirming promises. In this sense, what The Album Leaf’s music actually affirms is the impossibility of security. The emotions and memories conjured here are marked by a transitory in-between-ness, set in an otherwise chaotic, unpredictable world. But it’s in these crevices and fleeting moments where the music finds its most exquisite expressions. As LaValle himself sings on the closing title track, “Between waves / You take my breath.”", "genre": []}
{"album": "Mr. Robot – Volume 1 (Original Television Series Soundtrack)", "artist": "Mac Quayle", "description": "If there is one element that defines the television show   more than any other it’s the overarching sense of paranoia. It starts almost from the get-go, with the ominous, unidentified men in black suits who seem to be trailing protagonist Elliot Alderson no matter where he goes. Each new plot twist reveals deeper levels to the show’s overarching conspiracy, making it difficult to determine which characters are trustworthy. Over time, that paranoia begins to seep out of the screen and into the viewer; Elliott’s Dissociative Identity Disorder makes him the ultimate unreliable narrator and, as the show goes on, it becomes hard to know whether or not the show’s hero—who frequently breaks the fourth wall to speak to us directly—is telling the truth (the whopper of a reveal midway through Season Two is the perfect illustration of the lengths to which he’s willing to go in order to deceive us). One of his most frequently-repeated requests, “Please tell me you’re seeing this, too,” can be read as both a desire for allegiance as well as a test to see if his bait-and-switch with the viewer is working. And so it’s natural that a show that thrives on anxiety should be accompanied by an appropriately anxious soundtrack. The songs by Mac Quayle on the soundtracks to both the first and   are built on low-level synth pulses, the kinds of songs that swell slowly to gradually create an atmosphere of panic that’s suffocating. It would be convenient shorthand to call it “synthwave,” but the music here has none of that genre’s cutting, laser-sword dynamics. Instead, it feels more like a robotic EKG: on “1.0_2-oneincontrol.aiff” (the song titles mirror the episode titles’ computer-code structure,” the sound is barely present, just a few rising, misty synths over a blinking, dead-eyed bass note. When the tempos do tick upward, as on “1.0_6-leavem3here.flac,” with its syringe-pokes of guitar, there’s enough space between the notes to let the panic sweat pool. Divorced from the show,   plays best as discomfort music for insomniac conspiracy theorists. How else to explain “1.3_5-da3m0nsneverstop.ca,” a song whose gentle sawing keyboards seem designed to accompany 3am deep-dives in search of a connection between Stanley Kubrick and the moon landing. The second volume is darker still, notes barely emerging above a sickening bass rumble—perfect for the underrated season’s more muted, cerebral tone. The net effect is as unnerving as suddenly-recovered memories, as eerie as an abandoned Coney Island arcade. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Dead Ringers", "artist": "Horseback", "description": "As if Horseback’s discography wasn’t daunting enough—2013’s   compilation filled three fearless LPs with nothing but singles, splits, and rarities—the newly released   finds Jenks Miller once again reshaping his elusive sound. While repetition is still at the root of every recording, lulling the listener into a stupefied state, Miller has never come this close to making Factory-issued post-punk before. Admittedly, this is the kind of post-punk that only exists in the Horseback universe, a shifty place where the dark side of the human condition is explored, peppered with allusions to everyone from Carl Jung, David Cronenberg (the album’s named after one of his creeptastic films), and Joseph Campbell to Joy Division, Coil, and This Heat. So, no, the horse-riding death goddess on this album cover is not a heavy-metal nod, signalling a return to Miller’s blustery, blackened roots. Much like his   EP,  is more of a meditative journey, letting minimal synth lines and circuitous rhythms lead the way instead of screams, screeches, and squeals. No wonder Miller has been name-dropping folks like The Field, Terry Riley, and Laurie Spiegel lately. Now all we need is an electro-folk effort from Miller’s other North Carolina band ( ) to bring things full circle.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Mambos Levis D’Outro Mundo", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "For the past five years, Lisbon’s Principe label has been documenting the otherwise-neglected dance music being made in Portugal’s African immigrant communities. Primarily hailing from Angola, Cape Verde, and Guinea-Bissau, the rhythms that these new producers create draw on kuduro, zouk, batucada, kizomba, and tarraxinha, as well as footwork and hip-hop. But taxonomy isn’t as useful as the one word that covers it all: “batida”—my beat. It’s a manic, mutant, trickster sound, one usually restricted to online forums and in the tenement housing well outside of Lisbon. But Principe’s efforts have seen a great deal of this music released, usually on vinyl in hand-painted record sleeves as rough and striking as the music itself. This 23-track compilation is even handier, though, providing an immediate (and thorough) glimpse of this ever-changing sound. It familiarizes newcomers to the scene’s elders (still in their 20s for the most part), people like Marfox, Firmeza, and Nigga Fox, and also introduces up-and-comers. Marfox (the godfather of the scene, as you’ll note from the number of producers who have adopted his –fox suffix) contributes “Swaramgami,” which spins so fast it becomes giddy 140bpm gibberish; Nigga Fox’s “Lua” moves from a hiccupping hand drum pattern into an electro-asthma attack. The influx of new talent brings new wrinkles to batida. Puto Marcio’s “Não-Queiras-Ser” adds a minor-key synth wash to the tricky percussion so it arcs like a shooting star, while DJ CiroFox adds a smooth R&B melody. It promises that the scene might soon grow beyond both its sonic and geographical confines.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Westside Industrial", "artist": "M.O.T.H.", "description": "M.O.T.H.’s  is experimental in style and concept; the album imagines a world where culture becomes a commodity, and art is suffering from a serious identity crisis. A tale old as time, really, and like the best science fiction, it feels eerily familiar, a reflection of cities (including composer Matthew Finch’s current home of Brooklyn) reshaped by financial matters and fantasy. Finch’s uncomfortably numb narrative is told through two main characters—nameless, faceless visions of “him” and “her” trying to come to grips with a crumbling middle class and a society that sees nothing wrong with branding everyone’s belief system. Or, as Finch writes in the album’s theatrical liner notes, “I moved out here, to this mecca, because I believed in a story about this culture; because I believed in a myth about opportunity. I had no idea what I was participating in; I had no idea that I was an identity product of the elite knowledge workers of the middle class and acting as a symbol … promoting the culture and lifestyle of bourgeois materialism.” Which is really a roundabout way of saying what we all think when a luxe condo building bursts out of concrete, promising a boho lifestyle to all its lessees. As for what that   like, Finch doesn’t spell anything out. He stretches the  storyline across three long instrumentals that alternate between stormy ambient sequences, woofer-wrecking bass lines, and meditative drone tones. Remember that   no one saw last year? This is what would have happened if   was hired to do the score, which was tweaked slightly by the studio—just enough to show a few signs of hope, which glimmer until M.O.T.H.’s next LP, at least.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Heatweaver", "artist": "Jaw Gems", "description": "Producer   helped revolutionize the way rap instrumentals are composed. You remember his drums—the way they snapped, and the way they seemed ill-timed, yet perfectly on rhythm. Though his music scanned as hip-hop, Dilla dabbled in soul, jazz and electronica before his tragic death in 2006 at the age of 32. Kanye West and Pharrell have taken sonic cues from Dilla, and producers  ,   and Flying Lotus acknowledge his influence. Now add  , an electronic quartet from Portland, Maine. Of the group’s origins, keyboardist Hassan Muhammad says “Dilla is the common thread for how we all met and began playing together.” The group started recording collectively in 2009, and on its new album  , you can hear ties to the Dilla’s creative approach—though the end result lands closer to Flying Lotus circa 2008.   thrives on that same sort of loose electro-rap fusion, but the quartet’s blend feels light and improvised, skewed more towards jazz. The LP doesn’t lock into a singular groove, pivoting instead between pronounced and ambient soundscapes for a breezy, nuanced listen. On “Side King,” for example, wafting keys conjure pastoral images—you can almost   the sun-drenched beaches, the water washing up the shore. “Lead Sister” evokes similar scenery, yet the vibe is more festive due to a cavernous drum stomp. Mixing live and electronic elements,   feels relaxed, like four friends banging out a few cuts in a home studio just for fun. Albums are tough to pull off without a strong vocal narrative, but Jaw Gems have created a work that’s remarkably visual and nomadic, full of radiant energy that stays with you for its duration. This is the album you play when you want to go somewhere, when the destination doesn’t matter, and the road is unclear. If Dilla laid the blueprint for what hip-hop soul can sound like, Jaw Gems lets it breathe a bit more.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Posh Lost", "artist": "Posh Lost", "description": "Bands who operate within the shadowy realm of dark rock tend to post up in one of two extremes: either morose and brooding (Joy Division, The Sound) or fevered and anthemic (The Chameleons, Lords of the New Church). But the Minnesota group Posh Lost have found a way to split the difference. Their self-titled debut, released via the venerable Mirror Universe Tapes, is a case study in how to mope majestically. Their lineup allows them something of a cheat code: bassist Jack Woolsey’s low, desolate voice is perfect for the brooders; Guitarist Jeff Cornell’s gently-pleading tenor ideal for the anthems. The result is a record whose 10 songs are as bleak and mossy as an 18th Century cemetery, but have a nerviness and intensity that prevents them from feeling waterlogged. “Fabricate,” is the perfect example: the guitars prick and poke like bat talons, but Woolsey’s dark-prophet vocal style gives its three-word chorus (“She’s not eating”) a chilling ominousness. On “Sense of Self,” Cornell’s voice pulls the melody gracefully upward, the band floating like funeral mist far below. But more than that, Posh Lost know mood is nothing without the songs to back it up, and they have both; “Portraits” is a heartsick ballad that recalls Joy Division’s “Atmosphere,” suffused with soft blue synths and skeletal guitar; it could have been a tossed-off snoozer, but Woolsey’s simple, four-note melody makes it feel instant and indelible. “Impulse” clatters and rattles, erupting triumphantly at the chorus like a submerged magician finally wriggling free of the straitjacket. Posh Lost seem to be subconsciously following Bruce Cockburn’s old dictum about kicking the darkness until it bleeds daylight. Their debut offers a welcome, hefty helping of both.", "genre": []}
{"album": "For This We Fought the Battle of Ages", "artist": "SubRosa", "description": "Salt Lake City’s  is best known for its unusual configuration; few other doom metal bands are led by two violinists and three vocalists. On the three records they’ve released on the venerable Canadian label Profound Lore—2011’s  , 2013’s  , and now  the band has taken increasing advantage of the unique strengths its odd lineup affords. ’s superb opening track, the 15-minute “Despair is a Siren,” is a perfect snapshot of the band’s evolution. Sarah Pendleton and Kim Pack’s violins are the focal point, and they appear not with dramatic bow strokes, but with muted pizzicato, more percussive than melodic. Then comes the eruption: guitarist and lead vocalist Rebecca Vernon ominously intones, “I see the bars of the cage,” and a cacophony of strings swells and crashes like ocean waves in a thunderstorm. The wild, churning movements that follow justify the song’s epic length, and the three other tracks that cross the 10-minute mark do the same. But SubRosa are also adept making things heavier without necessarily making them louder. There are countless small moments on  the emphasis on a syllable, a moan of bass feedback, a split-second of harmony between the two violins—that give the album nuance and character. Where many doom bands turn to volume and repetition as conduits for increased emotional heft, the musicians in SubRosa have found an invisible world in those little spaces that makes them as devastating as any of their contemporaries. —", "genre": []}

The 17-minute collection boasts the group’s catchiest hooks to date, from the New-Wave pop riff that kicks off opening track “Cool 2” to the dramatic, Fleetwood Mac-inspired sonic buildup on “Gemini,” which closes the five-song EP. “So here I go, back into my same old malaise,” Auscherman sings on “Cool 2.” It could be the EP’s defining statement; with vocals buried in the mix, Auscherman, Krauter and Beresford sing about restless confusion and the tragicomic passing of time—subjects that contrast with the group’s propensity for relaxed melodies and inviting power-pop riffs. In just five brief songs, Hoops effectively channel ’80s New Wave while expanding on late ’00s chillwave, combining a fresh sense of pop craftsmanship with glowing, echo-drenched production.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Phase Zero", "artist": "Morgan Delt", "description": "Psychedelia was once rock’s avant-garde, but half a century later, the music of mind expansion can sound frustratingly conservative. Retreating into introspection— specifically, the stoned fantasies of the ‘60s—almost feels irresponsible in a world that demands engagement with the present. Though he lives in Los Angeles and wears his hair long, multi-instrumentalist Morgan Delt must understand this.  , his first album since leaving Chicago retro-rock label Trouble in Mind for Sub Pop, bathes serious anxieties about contemporary life in lysergic sunlight. You only have to squint a bit to identify the shadows on the horizon. The sounds of vultures circling and windstorms brewing in so many tracks’ long, ominous outros might be your first hint. Opener “I Don’t Wanna See What’s Happening Outside” sets up the dissonance between style and theme. Steel drum sounds splash like pebbles tossed into a stream. The buzzing in the background could be cicadas. Delt’s guitar ripples gently, his voice full of hippie sweetness. But he’s singing about witnessing, and turning away from, atrocities: “I saw bodies devoured / It’s no business of mine / You know I’m only a coward.” Given the news from Orlando, Baton Rouge, Milwaukee: it could be the song of the summer. Delt gets explicitly topical on “The System of 1000 Lies,” letting a reverent hush fall over anticapitalist salvos and clickbait clichés like “one weird trick.” More often, though, the visions of environmental apocalypse and human cruelty he buries under glittering instrumentals could come straight out of classic dystopic fiction.  may sound like the Summer of Love, but it reverberates with the fear that winter is coming.", "genre": []}

On his staggering new album   he takes on the jagged cadences of Senegalese rap and the murky atmospherics of underground hip-hop with a powerful live band that breathlessly translates electronic production ideas and MPC-derived beats in real-time to mostly acoustic instruments. Jazz and hip-hop have been flatmates for decades, but more often than not, fusions of the two have forced one of the ingredients to be watered down: not so with  Anti-Pop Consortium MC HPrizm and Dakar’s Gaston Bandimic, who raps in Wolof, slalom through the complex, stuttering shape-shifting grooves and clipped melodic shards shaped by altoist Lehman and French soprano saxophonist Maciek Lasserre. The horn men blow astringently precise passages that toggle between tightly coiled unison and lockstep counterpoint; their propulsive improvisations are as forceful as the words spit by the rappers. Drummer Damion Reid unleashes an epic performance, dropping heavy beats that constantly change direction, feel, and time signature from bar-to-bar, presenting himself as a human drum machine with a mind of its own—a sound he’s been perfecting since his contributions to the paradigm-shifting 2007 Robert Glasper album  . Double bassist Drew Gress anchors the splintered grooves while keyboardist Carlos Homs alternates between evocative textures, spooky harmony, and stabbing accents.

{"album": "Magic", "artist": "Hairy Hands", "description": "Many times, albums that attempt to scratch a listener’s itch for both songs, as well as beat-driven electronic landscaping, wind up neither here nor there. Songwriting demands the kind of acuity that the landscaper’s habit of focusing on pretty, hazy edges often undermines. But the songs-proper that decorate the laptop-driven fantasias of James Alexander Bright, the British producer who works under the moniker  , stick, and they help open up music that, left to its own devices, is usually just as inviting. So does Bright’s husky croon—like a weathered Junior Boys: slightly goofy, slightly aggrieved. It also helps that the lyrics are part and parcel of the music’s gently tripped-out tenor. Hairy Hands’  , has a concept (the search for a new planet for humanity to habit after making a mess of this one), but the words catch and hold even if you don’t grok that part. The lyric “It’s hard to not flow through the porthole” nicely abets the telephone dial tone, smudged brass lines, thwocking percussion, and random FX drops of “Suns,” while the refrain of “Wings” — “I love your wings, lady” — has a similarly apt relationship to the music’s strange stops-starts, and its almost comically delicate piano line alternating with an ostentatious bass line of the latter.

Rich Terrana’s drums on the track are almost a ghostly presence, felt more than heard, but they’re a vital element to the record’s swinging pace.

{"album": "Radiant Remains", "artist": "Radar Eyes", "description": "The   from Chicago’s Radar Eyes, on HoZac Records, was an echo-drenched, pinwheel-eyed batch of psych songs designed for shutting down and dropping out. Vocalist Anthony Cozzi was way, way, way down in the mix, with deference given to foamy washes of guitar. It was a durable, impressive entry into the constantly-growing catalog of post-’10s psych rock. But it was in no way a prelude to follow-up  , on which the band shakes off the THC malaise, turns off the lights and commences a chilling Saint Vitus Dance. Cozzi is bellowing now, terrified and terrifying, and opener “Dreaming of Giants” comes on like a sudden chill in an empty house—a tip-off that something supernatural has entered the room. Over the course of the album’s 10 songs, Radar Eyes combine the fanged severity of death rock with a newfound sense of tunefulness and dynamics. “Giants” works its way up to a cataclysmic chorus, chords crashing and banging like glassware hitting concrete. “Between Two Worlds” is more reserved, its loosely-knitted guitars recalling the early days of R.E.M., when they were still siphoning the darkness from the American south and turning it into song. What strikes most about the record is the band’s drive and force—all of the songs seem propelled by a sense of sweaty-palmed desperation. “Hungry Ghost” claws its way forward, Cozzi wailing like a freaked-out undertaker over the taut wire guitars. The album’s true showstopper is “A Daughter’s Hymn,” on which Cozzi duets with Angela Mullenhour of  . Over a funereal synth line, the pair spin the kind of tale that wouldn’t be out of place in a   story, full of black nights and sinister creatures.

On their debut album, the Philadelphia group has assembled a batch of nervy, searing, swaggering compositions inspired by metal legends like Judas Priest and Angel Witch. They come with a lengthy list of musical credentials: vocalist Phil Swanson once sang with Atlantean Kodex and Hour of 13 (among countless others), and producer/guitarist Arthur Rizk has manned the boards for Inquisition, Power Trip, and Pissgrave. That expertise shows: Sumerlands’ songs are full of triumphant, reverb-drenched vocal work, and are powered by riffs that are as catchy and infectious as they are clean, solid, and directional. Rizk’s solos are melodic and technical, and their unconventional placement—like the one in the closing moments of “The Guardian”—only serve to highlight his skill. Justin De Tore’s drumming is full of perfected accents, driving rhythms, and galloping fills, riding lockstep with Rizk’s leads. Tracks like “Haunted Forever” and “Timelash” follow the playbook for epic, heavy metal anthems: riffs awash in distortion, metronome-perfect drums and exultant singing. Sumerlands’ self-titled debut on   feels like heavy metal circa 1986 in the best possible way. —", "genre": []}

But on their follow-up,  , the California group has taken the opposite approach. With Jason Quever of indie rock band Papercuts on the boards, Sugar Candy Mountain largely abandon their maximalist soundscapes, opting instead for sparse arrangements that throw the group’s lyrical guitar figures and the voice of frontwoman Ash Reiter into sharp relief. While buried Reiter in the mix, on   she cuts through like a laser. Her voice is a brilliant and complex instrument; in the course of a single line, like the one that gives the album its title, she is able to sound both sweet and steeled, menacing and serene. Throughout   Reiter turns her gaze to profound questions of existence, and the mysterious quality of her voice makes the open-ended questions in her lyrics feel all the more haunting. For every mesmerizing hook Reiter sings, there’s a guitar part of equal magnitude. Opening track “Windows” is ripped apart by a harrowing and buzzing solo, and on “Tired” a serpentine riff nods strongly to the album’s surf-rock influences. Now that they’ve been given the proper space to shine, these elements drive home the message at the core of Sugar Candy Mountain’s sophomore album: sometimes less can be much more.", "genre": []}

The debut full-length by the Washington, DC hardcore vanguards makes their intentions plain. Every roar from vocalist Rob Watson rings out against racism (“Slander Me”), its force threaded through the state (“Potential Criminal”), and its long line of ruined lives on levels systemic (“Pipeline”) and personal (“Lost Child”). His bandmates match force, fusing the Oi!-influenced hardcore of their previous EPs with Discharge’s speed and NYHC’s heft. “Normalized Death” embodies this attack down to the second, charging with jackhammer chords before slowing to crush heads. Tracks like “Agents of the Machine” and “White Silence” complicate the onslaught. “Machine” takes  ’s blasts and switches out dynamite for nukes, while “Silence” finds Pure Disgust wringing complacency out of its targets’ necks, complete with NWOBHM chord progressions to prolong the choke.

The California-based experimental metal duo of Ignat Frege and Felix Skinner have been expanding genre limitations for a half-decade, adding elements of IDM, trap, and industrial into their carefully-wrought compositions. On their latest, they slow things down, mastering a control over the juxtaposition of loud/quiet dynamics that gives full clarity to the anxiety and torment expressed in their songs in lyrics like, “I will lie supine, a trough of disappointment.”  Throughout  , the band’s particular vision of desolation operates on an expansive scale. The album opens with the volatile track “Powders,” which is centered around Skinner’s desperate, pleading vocals. The song builds slowly, eventually becoming an explosive call-and-response tale of a dissolving relationship, setting the tone for the album early by destroying any notion of calm or stability.  The remaining nine songs expand on that theme, deepening the sense of quiet unease. “Liver,” builds tension and dread over five minutes, focusing on atmosphere rather than onslaught. That restraint makes the moments where the songs do ignite feel all the more powerful: “Languish” opens with Skinner’s guttural cry, “Is this the sensible world or just a sick joke,” as the music escalates to a cacophony of screaming violins and thunderous drumming. “I tried to feel so alive that I couldn’t feel alive anymore,” he laments. It comes off like a last ditch effort to feel something—even if that something is pain.   Their experimentation with different genres, and shifting between any two of them on a dime, adds to the album’s turbulent nature. This disorienting, at times chaotic framework, accentuates the album’s themes of overwhelming shame, confusion, and regret. By refusing to recognize these aesthetic boundaries, Wreck & Reference demonstrate the daring potential of metal. —", "genre": []}

While 2814’s previous album,   broke with obvious vaporwave signifiers in favor of gauzy chillwave and spellbinding ambience,  takes that same placid sense of rebirth and renders it into something much more purging and intense. “Before the Rain” and “Eyes of the Temple” pulse with grandiose synths and glimmering melodies, beckoning the listener toward something that exists beyond the everyday world. HKE has said that he and 2814 co-conspirator  aimed to write an album about, “a sacred place away from our current reality… a reality we can’t perceive with our limited senses.” Listening to the glowing, rippling electronics on “Transference” and “Contact,” it’s not hard to imagine that place.

By the end of  , it becomes clear that it’s a question she can only answer herself. The album’s title positions it as a sequel—the awkward, cruel extension of a life stage few people would willingly revisit. She depicts that tension and confusion with particular pointedness in “Happy,” where the titular emotion finally visits her, only to leave a mess behind. “Well I sighed and mumbled to myself/ ‘Again I have to clean,’” she sings in amusement. The sax riff and dry applause that follows land like a punch line. Subtle images of “pinky promise kisses,” of being the little spoon that “kiss[es] your fingers forever more,” of taking one last look at a lover in the rearview mirror, convey a vulnerable intimacy; it’s as if Mitski, in the midst of self-doubt and anxiety, wants to make herself smaller. Yet throughout the album, those subtleties give way to sudden, explosive moments of exhilaration and self-assertion: slow doo-wop declarations of love in “Once More to See You,” ragged howls and aggressively-strummed guitars in “My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars,” the invasive flash of sweet memories during “one warm summer night” in “Fireworks,” and the fierce look of love on “I Bet on Losing Dogs.” By the record’s end, it’s clear that Mitski has made peace with her question about a “loving feeling.” She finds all of the strength and peace she needs simply by loving herself.

So while Bert Jansch’s classic 1985 album  may not have an array of bells and whistles, its songs are full of great, small moments. The album’s 15 tracks tackle a range of themes, running from relationships to political fare, like “Shout.” Jansch performs most of them using only his trademark guitar style, with its unusual chord voicing and added notes, and his voice (album-opener “Sweet Rose” swaps in a banjo, bridging the gap between his native Scotland and the Americana he invokes). His Glaswegian accent gives his music a shade of distinction. On “Time is an Old Friend,” his skipping cadence adds emphasis to his elegant and poignant lyrics: “Living and recounting love long ago/ Is a quiet and lonely, tickets only/ One-man drowning show,” he sings. But Jansch’s words and voice aren’t his only strength. The title track is an instrumental with a melody similar to “The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face,” which appeared on Jansch’s famous 1966 album  . Using guitar alone, Jansch plugs along as if slowly winding his way down a country path. His style is as definitive as it is original: both Eric Clapton and Neil Young have cited him as an influence. Jansch passed away in 2011 from lung cancer, leaving behind an impressive array of work.   offers a stark reminder of his prolific talent. —", "genre": []}

But  , Steady Holiday’s terse full-length, compels because of the way it holds the listener at a distance. Shrouded in gentle waves of fuzzed-out guitars and glossy string arrangements, Babinski often serves as her own Greek chorus, tracking her voice on songs like the dreamlife fantasia “No Matter” and the bedheaded, regretful “Your Version Of Me” so that it sounds as if she’s commanding a clutch of ghosts in order to accurately depict her melancholia. It makes for a heady experience; even when the drums are crisp and the violins (played by Babinski herself) have a precision to their swoop, much of   recalls whispering breezes and rippling ponds, gentle reminders of tumult held elsewhere. Babinski usually avoids vibrato, instead taking on a vocal affect that brings to mind Trish Keenan’s matter-of-fact gloominess.

On the first-slow-dance shuffle “So Long,” she sings of bruises and endings; at one point, her voice buckles, sounding like she’s about to rupture her cool façade and adding emotional heft to the album’s free-floating grey cloud. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Mirrors", "artist": "Mala", "description": "Mala, founding member of the South London label and nightclub DMZ, is one of relatively few figures who could lay legitimate claim to inventing dubstep. His potent, hollowed-out bass music points back to sound system culture and steppers’ reggae, even as it engineered its low end into something pristine and impossibly heavy. When EDM blew up, Mala could have cashed out. Instead, for his debut album  , he went to Havana, tracked down local musicians and refined a distinctly Afro-Cuban take on bass futurism. His new album   takes a broadly similar approach: this time we find Mala traveling with his laptop through Peru, visiting Lima, Cusco and the Sacred Valley, and winding Afro-Peruvian percussionists and grassroots tap dancers into his insistent sub-bass. The music is sonically robust and rooted in low end, but decorated with unlikely musical detail. On “Kotos,” the pan flutes of marching band Asociacion Juvenil Puno weave through Mala’s hopping pads and echo-soaked snares, while “They’re Coming” and “Shadows” seamlessly meld cool synth washes with clacking hand percussion. There is little sense of gimmickry to  . Indeed, Mala at times seems too taken by his subject matter, yet two understated tracks—“Cunumicita” and “Sound Of The River”—peel away the bass and percussion, hanging on the gorgeous vocals of singer-songwriter Danitse and soprano Sylvia Falcón, respectively. And if   can feel a little Buena Vista Social Club in places, that’s far preferable to another bass music record limply rolling out 30-year-old   tropes. Besides, when a record can come up with something as plainly beautiful as “The Calling,” it has much to recommend it. You probably never thought you’d come across a dubstep track that reminded you most of the sparkling guitar miniatures of Vini Reilly’s The Durutti Column. And yet, here we are. —", "genre": []}

Fittingly released during a leap year (Arnes named the group after his Feb. 29 birthday), the follow-up to last year’s debut album  marks a significant sea change for the group sonically, with the band stripping down their heady, experimental sound to opt for a more refined, vibrant power-pop, comprised of swooning sing-along melodies, robust and angular guitar and tasteful rhythmic sections. Tracked live with Titus Andronicus guitarist Adam Reich over just three days, the record is immediate from the start, thanks in part to new drummer Alejandro Salazar Dyer. The garage-rock, reflective first single “Alabaster Snow” aptly showcases the album’s focused delivery, with Arnes lamenting about feeling dejected and worn down, atop a bed of boisterous chords paired with meditative,  -esque backing vocals, as he admits “I don’t know what to do/tie me in a bow/or fix me up with glue/I’m broken just like you.” Themes of self-evaluation, anxiety and the passing of time persist throughout, as seen in the airy “One Hit Wonder”—which begins “Are you lost with indecision, or stuck with tunnel vision?/I know there’s more, just beyond the creaky door”—and LP closer “Time Keeps Tickin,’” where baroque string arrangements, recorded with Ava Luna’s Julian Fader and Carlos Hernandez, stun as Arnes croons, “They say that nothing’s ever free/ but time keeps tickin’/I think I’ll be sticking with you.” And even if there aren’t many traces of the group’s complex, psychedelic-DIY foundation, the group’s newfound explicitness and leaner sound will undoubtedly bolster their ascent towards a wider and even more mainstream appeal. —", "genre": []}

It’s just a few sparse piano notes, with expectant space in between, before subtle shadings of ambient electronics slowly start to fill up the frame, along with a few other elegant adornments: distant synths, floaty flecks of Spanish guitar and what sounds (or just feels) like warm flushes of air pumped into a recording studio. It requires a good bit of confidence to open on a note of such restraint, and the Berlin-based Boysen maintains it throughout an album that only grows stronger as it makes its delicacy more apparent. After the slow-opening reveal of “The Veil,”   sounds as if it was composed as an album, with a steady treatment of a theme that develops, but never loses track of, the ambient gentleness at its core. “Nocturne 3” introduces drums, every tap deliberate and isolated. The eight-minute “Golden Times I” brings more aural material into the mix, including strings, throbbing electronics and synths that bristle with an intensity that surprises but never spills out beyond all the tidy lines and shapes. “Nocturne 4” delivers a sort of culmination off all that has been building before, breaking open into a subtly prog-inflected groove evocative of the French atmospheric duo Air. From there it’s a slow and decorous return to the sparseness at the start, with the memory of all that has transpired during the album’s journey amplifying Boysen’s poignant mix of melancholia and contemplation. —", "genre": []}

If it means the fanbase that first discovered his MPC  prowess in ’96 still fiends for a return to that inimitable style, so be it; DJ Shadow will be damned if the hip-hop world he grew up in moves on without him. Sometimes he’s gone far afield—his notorious turn towards hyphy on 2006’s   and omnidirectional metal/indie/EDM feints on 2011’s  —but his mistakes, such as they are, remain his own; they don’t come from boredom or laziness, but curiosity and adventure. comes nearly five years after  …, and if time is the most obvious thing separating these two albums, Shadow’s emergence out of the dusty vinyl catacombs to engage more deeply with contemporary alt-beats runs a close second. The album grew out of a prodigal-son-returns DJ gig for Los Angeles’s Low End Theory series, the same turf where instrumental hip-hop heirs like Flying Lotus and Gaslamp Killer went fully cosmic. And what Shadow took away from this rejuvenation wasn’t a renewed urge to lay down more door-kicking breaks—it’s a sense of nuance and distance, Ableton-manipulated live instruments given room to breathe and unfurl amidst the chopped-up but often sparse beats. Case in point: “Nobody Speak” features  threatening their customary beatings to assorted wild animals and members of your family, but its skulking boom-bap simmer is twangy, playful, and slyly casual compared to El-P’s usual production slate of intense hydraulic-press low-end. And DJ Shadow gets better the subtler he is, letting the negative space breathe through dubby reverb elsewhere to stunning effect. The glitchy, gliding burble of the Nils Frahm teamup “Bergschrund,” the spiritual-jazz haze of “Ashes to Oceans” (featuring a misty waterfront noir trumpet from Manchester’s Matthew Halsall) and the Daedalus-via-Broadcast eeriness of “Pitter Patter” (a collab with Bleep Bloop and Nite School Klik partner G.

Lindstrøm’s  EP isn’t exactly a throwback to the late ’00s of  with its stratospheric Vangelis/Göttsching sprawl, but it still has enough moments of anthemic cosmic-disco to indicate he’s regained his footing. “Closing Shot” is the standout, a dose of handclaps-and-hi-hats dancefloor classicism that plays up his sound’s easy integration with classic ’80s boogie funk and Detroit techno chord progressions. It’s one of his best concentrated doses of quality house since 2005’s “I Feel Space.” “Algorytme” is a slightly sharper-edged cut that lets the melody sneak its way between minimal flourishes and intricate builds; the underlying groove pairs synth-bass and conga in ways that’ll send listeners fiddling with their EQ to maximize the low end. The all-enveloping synthpop glide of “Foehn” is pure frictionless forward motion that makes triple-digit BPMs feel like floating without gravity.  It’s encouraging enough that  feels like Lindstrøm never left.

That’s not to say  isn’t vicious. What makes it so remarkable is its effortless ability to fuse honest-to-Satan black metal blitzing with undeniable songwriting. Singer, guitarist and sole constant member Decaylust expands his vocal range, reaching down for guttural lows and soaring to throat-ripping highs, and the songs expand to accommodate him. On “Scars Adorn the Whore in Red,” for instance, the instruments drop out for a split-second midway through, then Decaylust howls,  To enter the nightside of your cold embrace/Is to cross the borders to the darkness of death.” When the guitars and drums surge back, the song hits a stride most bands only dream of attaining—equal parts groove, menace, and pure forward momentum. On “Sophrosune,” an album-closing epic in the vein of Watain’s “Stellarvore” and “Waters of Ain,” the band’s potential is fully realized. The song slithers between triumphant leads, savage mid-tempo riffing, and moody acoustic interludes, with Decaylust directing the proceedings from his lunatic pulpit as “a wanderer at the gates of never.” In Greek philosophy, the   was said to possess a soundness of mind that allows for self-knowledge; it’s fitting, then, that the song represents Denouncement Pyre’s fullest understanding of their strengths.

{"album": "A Bloom Beyond", "artist": "Terribly Yours", "description": "Terribly Yours, the current   of Brooklyn-based musician Sean Bones, tagged its debut full-length   with “devotional,” and the opening track, the gently-burbling “Answered Prayers,” is indicative of that mood: “Just remember all the ways you’ve been asking to be saved,” he notes, while a choir (which includes his three-year-old daughter) soars above him.  , however, is one of those prayers that celebrates while also stating desires—a gem that sparkles with hope for a better world as much as it does gratitude toward the good that has managed to win out. Bones’s version of synthpop isn’t grounded in a particular era or style—if anything, what makes   such a fun album is Bones’s clear willingness to explore, whether he’s adding filigrees of organ to the 3 a.m. swagger of “Cemeteries In Reverse” or playing gently-jangling guitar over the bobbing bass of “No Genius,” on which his singing’s razor-sharp cadence recalls the pointed conversational tone of Spoon’s Britt Daniel. The hazy textures of the besotted “Barbara” and the bouncing-ball beat of “See Through The Dark” only add to the effervescent excitement—made even more bubbly by the idea that anything might happen—that flows throughout  .   —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Turn Into", "artist": "Jay Som", "description": "Melina Duterte has been a musician for 13 years—which is impressive, considering she’s only 22 years old. But ever since she was a teenager, Duterte has been creating intimate fuzz-pop under the moniker Jay Som, and the buzz in her native San Francisco has pegged her as the Bay Area’s next big breakout. The early press has borne that theory out: Pitchfork blessed her song “I Think You’re Alright” with  . , her first full-length, began life as a demo tape shot off into the Internet abyss. Duterte uploaded it to Bandcamp in late 2015, dubbing it nine “finished and unfinished songs.” Now, it’s getting a proper re-release through Polyvinyl Records. The immediately obvious standout is “Next To Me”—a polished stab at something more upbeat and sweetly lilting, similar in style to Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin. Lyrically, it’s hard-hitting: “And fuck being patient. I’m fragile—I’m not weak.” Indeed, Duterte’s strength and determination runs through   like a molten iron core, a firm anchor and foil for her gauzy instrumentation and melodies. The interplay between grit and sweetness drives   forward, making it an emotionally honest snapshot of an artist beginning to find her identity. —", "genre": []}

But lest this be confused with punk boosterism: Pkew Pkew Pkew are aware that hyper-hooky songs about skateboarding, drinking, pizza, getting drunk  you go out drinking, and eating pizza  you go out drinking tends to be the domain of a likewise hyper-masculine (read: bro) audience.

{"album": "Expert Knob Twiddlers", "artist": "Mike & Rich", "description": "This is turning out to be a great decade to be an Aphex Twin fan: In the past two years, we’ve been treated to four new records, the Kickstarter-enabled release of a lost Caustic Window LP from 1994, and a landslide of demos that the occasionally hermetic artist simply batch-dumped on SoundCloud. Now another 1994 recording comes to light:  , Richard D. James’ playful collaboration with Planet Mu founder Mike Paradinas, aka µ-Ziq. Originally released on James’ Rephlex label in 1996, the album has been out of print for years, but Planet Mu is giving it the extensive reissue treatment, adding seven previously unreleased cuts to round out a double-CD or triple-LP package; all tracks have been remastered from the original DATs. Anyone who still believes that electronic music takes itself too seriously has probably never encountered this particular album, the cover of which is designed to resemble the   for the classic Milton Bradley game Downfall; they even tweaked the MB Games logo to say “MR Games,” short for the duo’s one-off alias, Mike & Rich. The music follows suit: Recorded over three days and nights in James’ flat, the album often finds the two at their zaniest, indulging a yen for wonky disco, spy-movie music, and other kitschy hallmarks of the easy-listening revival of the mid ’90s. “Reg” pairs swinging ’60s backbeats with marimba and whistling; “Mr. Frosty” evokes a lonely student disco with fist-mashed keys and an icy, dissonant sheen. It can be pretty puerile, even for James—the squelchy “Upright Kangaroo” is punctuated by actual belches—and it definitely ranks as a minor work in both artists’ respective catalogs. Still, it’s a worthy historic curio: For one thing, it marks one of the few occasions James has ever recorded with another artist. (Prior to his sessions with Paradinas, James had tried making music with Luke Vibert and a few other like-minded souls, but none of those tracks ever saw the light of day. Still, the sessions with Paradinas sound intense, and not only because they spent much of them drunk: “It was strange, the way we worked,” Paradinas told  when the album was first released. “We didn’t talk a lot. We didn’t talk at all, in fact.”) The best songs still sound exceptionally strange, even today; time has not tempered their weirdness. “Eggy Toast” is a woozy, brooding meditation in 7/4 time, the scabrous “Vodka” captures the duo’s noisiest impulses in full flower, and “The Sound of the Beady Eyes”—the title came to them while tripping on acid—is a meandering, brain-melting organ showcase that might be the closest either of these two ever got to jam-band territory. Better yet, this might be the rare occasion where the bonus material actually eclipses some of the original cuts: “Waltz,” in particular, unfurls a strangely moving chord progression as it notches up the distortion and delay—it’s as expressive as it is exploratory, in the finest Rephlex tradition. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Fallen", "artist": "Steven Julien", "description": "Too often, dance albums settle for creating atmosphere rather than commanding attention. But the good ones do both. The solo debut by  , the London producer and label head best known for the work he releases under the name Funkineven, has a deliberately unpolished production style that’s a tonic in the face of mid ’10s dance music’s chronic maximalism. These tracks, heavy on vintage analog synthesizers, put the emphasis on Julien’s tunes, and the best stuff has real meat on its bones. “Kingdom” throws back to prime Chicago acid house, while “XL” is a boom-SNAP house track hooked on an off-kilter piano loop and a vocal snatch of the Jimmy Castor Bunch’s sample staple “It’s Just Begun.” (Julien ends it with what sounds like an early, drum-less demo of the track, a neat reversal of dance music’s usual build-to-a-peak style.) And “Disciple” crosses jazz-fusion bass with a driving breakbeat and buzzing analog synth, like circa-2000 broken-beat minus the smarm. It’s atmospheric, sure—but that’s not all it is. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Habit", "artist": "Snail Mail", "description": "Even in her most desperate moments, Snail Mail’s Lindsey Jordan sounds calm and collected. Her voice may raise a few octaves when delivering macabre lyrics about depression and death, but it never cracks or wavers. Which is not to say that   is one-note—it’s not. It’s just carefully composed. Jordan’s plaintive, deliberate storytelling style is the perfect complement to her band’s mellowed-out music. Most of the songs on   are built on measured drumming and soft, hypnotic riffs. Jordan is a self-deprecating songwriter, often evoking the decay and sediment of the natural world to get at her reflexive feelings; she likens herself to a gastropod (“Slug”) and begs to be covered in flies (“Static Buzz”). On “Dirt,” she waxes philosophical, looking to the future in an attempt to overcome her present woes. “Baby, when I’m 30, I’ll laugh about how dumb it felt,” she sings, “And, oh God, it’s not funny, but I know we can laugh it out.” It’s a song about getting perspective and letting go gracefully, and Jordan articulates this sentiment with a dexterity that’s rare for a lyricist who’s not yet 18. Throughout  Jordan excels at self-reflection, interrogating herself before turning to others. On “Stick,” the album’s most minimal—and, arguably, most compelling—track, the percussion drops out, the guitars get sparse, and Jordan sings: “Do you dream about the people that wrong you? Do you see those faces again and again?/ And what holy thing has come to possess you? Or does it all just blend together in your head?” It’s a fitting conclusion to an album that establishes Jordan as both a diarist and a storyteller;   is the voice of a young woman in full control of her own nascent—and ascendant—narrative. —", "genre": []}

On her latest solo work,  , Zedek’s throaty, well-worn utterances are still the main draw. Here, she continues to stretch her voice beyond comfort, unafraid to risk the illusion of purity for that elusive melody or weathered sentiment, its imperfections glistening and throbbing against the muscular backdrop provided by her band. Zedek’s guitar work adds a similar grit. Her blues-influenced riffs are rough-edged, working their progressions into the raw, spacious aesthetic that we’ve come to expect of her. So while tracks like “Walking in Time” showcase her band’s impeccable ability to create movement and atmosphere, it’s her guitar that throws the necessary cracks into the veneer, ripping through the comparatively traditional song structures to get at something raw and real. While Zedek’s lyrics often deal with alienation and despair, she’s made it clear in interviews that they shouldn’t always be read as autobiographical. Her lyrics are less about her and more about the emotional spaces she taps into. But if we can take anything away from this veteran artist, it’s that the grain of her voice—that ever-indeterminable, sensual aspect of vocal performance—persists, regardless of any lyrical interpretations. And on  , it sounds as thrilling as it ever has.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Cloak", "artist": "Jordan Rakei", "description": "Jordan Rakei hails from Brisbane, Australia, a continent that produced the acclaimed jazz-funk ensemble Hiatus Kaiyote, and harbors a soul scene in thrall to the nu-funk stylings of early ’00s America. Rakei’s debut,   harkens back to that same sound; it has the jittery, “boom-clap” kick drums made famous by J Dilla, and the warm and enveloping keyboards that turned up on D’Angelo’s   and Kool & the Gang’s “Summer Madness.” Its centerpiece is “Midnight Mischief,” a five-minute swirl of seduction garlanded with hi-hat percussion and Rakei’s jazz-inflected vocals. On “Rooftop,” Rakei describes the sensation of a first kiss in blushingly intimate terms. Throughout, his voice is quietly insistent, luxuriating naturally within the groove; but he’s just as effective when he picks up the pace. “Talk to Me” combines strummed guitar with Latin jazz rhythms, and on “Toko,” Rakei sings, “Time flies inside of me” over a splintering hard-bop beat. And while   is mostly an album about introspection, Rakei keeps moodiness at bay. On “The Light,” he sings, “life is better when you’re open”;   is the sound of relaxing and letting go. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Green Glass Room", "artist": "VATS", "description": "With their ice-cold, razor-edged guitars and blank-verse writing style, Seattle, Washington trio VATS mirror the stone-faced, no-bullshit/no-emotion/no-fucks-given M.O. of post-punk forebears like Wire and The Fall. Like those bands’ best records, most of   scans like a pocket guide to enacting a   revolution, one where victory is celebrated with a nod and a firm handshake. Most of the songs play out like marching orders. On “Drag,” over a rusted-Slinky guitar line and rigor-mortis percussion, vocalists Sarah, JJ, and Gabe (no last names, please) bellow lyrics that are part insurgent’s instruction manual, part college syllabus on the Situationist movement: “Power in numbers is the failure of lovers/ Make yourself stronger/ disrupt the order.” If all of this makes   sound pretty humorless, that’s because it is—but that’s also the point. There’s something deeply unsettling about the dutiful, expressionless way VATS go about the business of fomenting social change; in their songs, cultural revolution comes because the band has quietly eliminated every other option. To this end,   is disconcertingly effective. “Impenetrable Urge”—the title of which tellingly twists Devo’s “Uncontrollable Urge” into something more opaque—is carved to ribbons by taut slashes of guitar. Its lyrics depict a world where pleasure comes through routine, and its machinelike cadence mirrors that message: “We have no interest in helping with pent-up frustration,” Sarah sternly sings, “We do not owe you counsel.” Their cover of Malaria!’s “Your Turn to Run” is gloomier and feels hollower than the original, crossing it with Wire’s “Being Sucked In Again” and making its lyrics—”There will come a time when I’m your only one”—feel less like a love letter and more like a dictator’s idea of pillow talk. This is  ’s great trick: at a time when young punk bands are railing against systemic injustices with power and force, VATS are pulling a Kraftwerkian bait-and-switch, adopting the ice-cold personalities of authoritarian demagogues as a way to expose their dark, sinister power. By cannily layering messages of revolt in small doses, they feel less like a band, and more like embedded mutineers, sneaking out battle plans by slipping well-placed trigger words into State Addresses. “You deny autonomy/ and I control myself,” Gabe announces on “Half Night.” That VATS plays both sides of that equation so perfectly is what makes   so difficult to shake. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Innocence Reaches", "artist": "of Montreal", "description": "At one point on “it’s different for girls,” the buoyant standout from of Montreal’s 14th album,  , founder Kevin Barnes sings, “Though some women are demons, all of them are God.” This uncomfortable, sometimes nasty, sometimes sensual sentiment is all over the album, which largely chronicles Barnes’ affairs and disappointments as a single person after the end of his marriage two years ago. The suffering he’s gone through seems to have paid off—it’s one of his most focused and rewarding records in years. Dating isn’t the only new thing Barnes is trying out. Though songs like “gratuitous abscesses” draw on typical of Montreal inspirations, like ‘60s pop, much of the music here is breaks new ground. Barnes listened to electronic producers like Jack U and Arca while writing these songs, and electro-pop opener “let’s relate” and the EDM-inspired “trashed exs” reveal the effects of those explorations. It’s not hard to imagine either tracks strategically placed in an underground DJ set. Like all of Barnes work, the real meat of this album is its confessional, unflinching subject matter. On “def pacts,” the effect is devastating: “It’s so tedious watching someone you care about keep failing themselves,” he sings, presumably about an emotionally unstable past lover. It’s one of the album’s most sonically interesting songs, a five-minute suite that alternates between minimal percussion, funky bass, and misty, near-whispered vocals nestled in swaying psychedelic pop. In a way, Barnes is the indiepop Kanye West: his lyrics mercilessly expose his self-hatred and his tendency to judge others. It’s what makes him endlessly fascinating as an artist, two decades into his career. “To survive in this world, you don’t have to become a parasite, you don’t have to be so mercenary, so cruel,” he sings on “def pacts.” Then he admits, “I’m just now learning this myself.” —", "genre": []}

The group combines progressive rock, experimental music, and folk for a result that’s warm and immediate.   also showcases the group’s multidisciplinary interests; each song is spiked with references to classic literature and film. Above all,   demonstrates the band’s ability to put less-mainstream impulses in an approachable context. Compositional movements, abundant with half-steps and minor keys (“Silver Strings,” “The Great Ohio Desert,” “Father Ferapont”), blend seamlessly with singable melodies, and a cornucopia of instruments—including cellos, hand shakers, and toy pianos. Verses and choruses switch between major and minor, and instrumental hooks incorporate accidental tones. Beneath   intricate musical infrastructure, its lyrical substance is just as rich. Its song titles (e.g. “The Holy Man of Iron City,” “Father Zosima,”) feel ripped from a volume of Aesop’s Fables. Throughout, the band uses fantastic imagery to document real-life experiences. “Zachary” is loosely based on the documentary   “2:05” recalls a friend’s death from heroin, but sets the ugly loss against a visually arresting backdrop (“I recall the haze on fire / all the embers as street lights line the avenue / I recall the smile from a ghost who didn’t quite know it yet”). Frontman Brandon Peterson describes his unexpected move to a new home like a fragile picture: “The static spreads, reveals the moon / dangling high from tiny spools / stretched tight like wires, but deep down in grooves / a puzzled frame without the glue.”  density—lyrical, instrumental, and literal—is evidence of the group’s unwillingness to follow convention. Pulling from books, film, and visual art,   is able to transform relatable emotions and life events into narratives that sound anything but ordinary, but remaining true to the life experience within each song—happy ending or not. —", "genre": []}

Each of its 13 songs is composed by a different artist, but each one also hews close to the label’s defined aesthetic: electronic-leaning, lo-fi pop. But despite this general overlap, there’s a clear split between the glitchy, experimental electronica of Katie Dey, Ricky Eat Acid, the aqueous synth ballads proffered by Hildebrand’s Foxes in Fiction and the more straightforward pop of R.L. Kelly, Infinity Crush, and Owen Pallett. The one constant is a general propensity for introspective, backward-looking lyrics. The album’s three standouts—Soccer Mommy’s “Memories,” R.L. Kelly’s “Mad,” and Yohuna’s “Geese Outside”—form a constellation of isolation; “Mad” ends with R.L. Kelly singing, “I can’t remember the person I used to be,” atop a solo guitar while “Geese Outside” begins with Yohuna singing, “I don’t remember a time / when I was happy, gracious, or kind.” The songs on   not only define bedroom pop, but provide a compact introduction for future listeners. —", "genre": []}

She leaked from every pore.” Indeed. Too bad today’s NYC is about as far removed from its stabby  -era as Robert De Niro himself; from its oligarchy-owned billion dollar towers to its shrinking creative and working class, the city’s in its   phase. On the surface, at least. The truth is, ordinary folks are as fucked as they’ve ever been, and bands like Brooklyn’s own Pill aren’t taking things sitting down.

Free-jazz, noise, and improv also inform everything Pill does. Which, come to think of it, was no-wave’s point—obliterating the boundaries punk had set up for itself.

{"album": "Body Wash", "artist": "MNDSGN", "description": "If Ringgo Ancheta had a superpower, it would most likely be the ability to transform himself into musical vibrations. Recording under the name   (pronounced “mind design”), his personality seems to disappear completely into his music, drifting through space on some distant astral plane. So the concept behind Ancheta’s new album,  , comes as little surprise: It’s about a homeless man who meets a mysterious woman, who gives him shelter and instructs him to bathe with a body wash that transports him to an alternate dimension. Sonically,  is a 16-track synth-funk album that bears a strong kinship with the work of singer/rapper Anderson .Paak. Both artists pull from ’80s R&B, tweaking it slightly so it connects with modern-day listeners. Ancheta took his artist name from a lyric on Nas’s 1996 song “Affirmative Action” (“My mind is seeing through ya design like blind fury…”), and grew up on a commune, the child of a Filipino revolutionary and Ivy League neuroscientist. That experience opened his eyes to a wide variety of both sonic and social perspectives, giving him the kind of nuanced viewpoint necessary to create music that’s both familiar and esoteric. Even when it’s conjuring visions of an early ‘80s roller rink,   feels distinct. Songs like “Cosmic Perspective” and “Alluptoyou” have the kind of shark-skin suit/champagne soul upon which Death Row Records built a rap empire in the mid ‘90s, as well as the “Computer Blue”-era techno-soul that Andre 3000 mined to great benefit on 2003’s  . Vocally, Archeta isn’t as polished: On “Alluptoyou,” in particular, his vocals are run through a heavy electronic filter, giving them an almost robotic quality. “Ya Own Way,” “Transmissionnn,” and “Lather” are exuberant homages; all three tracks open with crystallized breaks, a la Zapp and Roger Troutman’s 1986 classic “Computer Love.” Simmering keytars and noodling synthesizers run up and down the scales, and the entire song builds to a euphoric end. But even if you’re not aware of the album’s nostalgic reference points,   is still fresh and exciting, built on a sensual, transformative sounds. “Searchin’” is the album’s true home-run; the song is billed as a three-act play (“4 That Familiar Feelin’,” “4 Sumthin’ New,” “4 Nothin Else”), demonstrating the wide scope of Archeta’s artistic vision. Closing out with toe-tapping melodic G-funk, these are ambitious tracks that ultimately hit the mark. On  , Archeta drifts deep into the crates, returning with something resonant and ambitious. He aims for the stars, doing his best to transcend his art and personal existence, making a joyous LP. This is a moment for celebration—a cosmic dance jam. —", "genre": []}

{"album": "The Land (Music from the Motion Picture)", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "As skater culture has spread from its suburban-Cali pool-carver origins to international inner-city street style, the accompanying soundtrack has shifted along with it. Nowadays, it feels more closely tied to post-backpacker hip-hop than it ever was with the hardcore or crossover thrash of skateboarding in the ’80s. Steven Caple Jr.’s film  takes full advantage of this, and not just by its association with executive producer Nas. The soundtrack for the film, in which aspiring young Cleveland skaters’ petty crimes spiral into something more ambitious and dangerous, gives the film’s place in hip-hop a deep focus. The soundtrack isn’t exploitatively star-packed, nor is it overly reliant on trying to break unknown indie favorites. It’s more of a mood-setting companion piece to a film uninterested in easy triumph. The big names get a decent amount of shine: Machine Gun Kelly, who appears in the film as a convenience store employee, fits the vibe well, even if the hesher-rock simplicity of “Dopeman” won’t win too many skeptical converts in the “real hip-hop” set. And the beatless orchestral moodiness of “This Bitter Land,” a teamup between Nas and Erykah Badu (who has a small role as a sex worker in the film), is an allusive, impressive display of both artists’ respective vocal chops. But even with big-name artists pulling the weight—there’s a Kanye-featuring French Montana cut and a Pusha T/Jeremih collab—it’s the artists closer to the skate-rap underground who make the most of it. Fashawn’s character portrait “Cisco’s Theme,” the chest-collapsing bass panic of Jerreau’s “Looking for Something,” and the Dilla-via-Carpenter drones of Nosaj Thing’s instrumental score come closest to nailing that sense of rootless, teenage dread.", "genre": []}

As a result, the album plays like a blurry, delightful travelogue, capturing Collins’ rambling odyssey from coast to coast. While he’s certainly the project’s ringleader, more often than not it’s his pals who take center stage. Collaborators like Ariel Pink, Weyes Blood’s Natalie Mering (who steals the show on both the album’s title track and the halting lead single “Suddenly”) and Sheer Agony’s Jackson MacIntosh raise their voices more than Collins himself.  maintains the palette of his past work, but this time around, Michael Collins has honed in on the age-old maxim that we’re only as good as the company we keep. —", "genre": []}

{"album": "Splendor and Misery", "artist": "clipping.", "description": "“Oblivion is preferable to white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism.” That’s what   earlier this month. On  , clipping.’s third album, the Los Angeles noise-rap trio embraces those words as both ethos and mission. The album melds Afrofuturism and Afropessimism to tell the tale of a runaway slave who pilots his sentient mothership as far away as possible from this planet, its prejudice, and its pain. As with George Clinton and Sun Ra, space is the place for clipping.’s evolution. On “All Black” and “Wake Up”  ’s production hisses and clicks, unburdened by the gravitational pull of contemporary hip-hop. Instead of booming 808s, clipping.’s songs center around vocalist Daveed Diggs. Diggs jumps seamlessly from his role in   to clipping’s future fiction, firing off tales of desolation with the icy precision of Scarface and Raekwon. On “Air ‘Em Out,” he flips   into interstellar trap. “Baby Don’t Sleep” harkens back to clipping.’s debut,  , glacial pockets of sound subsumed by walls of noise. These tracks, along with  ’s Negro spiritual interludes, showcase a group that’s unafraid to bury old roots in new galaxies. Enjoy the oblivion.", "genre": []}

The vaporwave producers   and   have banded together to release a sumptuous feast of gooey love themes. And while the uninitiated might be tempted to accuse the pair of gross sentimentality, those familiar with their respective solo albums won’t be surprised to hear that the love presented on this record is a farce. Having already released a slew of highlights within the vaporwave genre, waterfront dining is no stranger to music depicting modern existence as a wishful simulation. Neither is 蜃気楼MIRAGE, who despite being active for only a couple of years, has been responsible for a wide array of records under such aliases as  ,   and  . Together, they’ve produced the strangely intoxicating  , which takes ballads from the ’80s and ramps up their schmaltz-factor while retaining a faint air of ambiguity. Such serenades as “even when you sleep” and “甘いタブー” drip in amorous saxophones and shimmering cymbal splashes, yet at the same time they possess a thick, humid atmosphere that makes them more absorbing than they have any right to be. This seductive atmosphere can be chalked up to the production skills of  ’ creators, who’ve harnessed vaporwave’s characteristic focus on unreality and interestingly refocused it on love and romance. In doing this, they haven’t only suggested that even our most intimate sentiments and feelings can often be artificial, but have also forged an album whose syrupy yet subtle tracks will creep under your skin and stay there, like the memory of a torrid love affair. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Sunergy", "artist": "Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith & Suzanne Ciani", "description": "When   moved to Bolinas, California, back in 1992, many of Silicon Valley’s billionaires still had babysitters and Al Gore was just starting to get attention for attacking the  Bush administration about global warming. The coastal artist community is still full of self-governed loners nearly 25 years later, but that doesn’t mean their way of life hasn’t felt threatened by climate change and the Bay Area’s status as a playground for the New Wolves of Wall Street. Or as a   once put it—and this was  —“Welcome to Bolinas; Please Keep On Moving.” That story opened with water district president Vic Amoroso pushing back against the village’s popularity with “belligerent young males” by insisting “there is no reason to come to Bolinas. The beaches are dirty, the Fire Department is terrible, the natives are hostile and have a tendency towards cannibalism.” Suzanne Ciani is not a cannibal. She’s actually quite lovely—a welcoming, Buchla-worshipping synthesist who’s attracted a new generation of fans thanks to several   reissues and recent performances alongside   (a.k.a. Andy Votel and Demdike Stare’s Sean Canty). The composer’s second coming shows no signs of slowing down with  , either. Its two side-long pieces are pure reflections of Ciani’s raw surroundings. Cut at home with fellow Bolinas resident   as part of  ’s cross-generational FRKWYS series, they’re not quite ambient or avant-garde. “A New Day” and “Closed Circuit” are soothing   unsettling—the sound of a stormy computer age that’s spun out of control, leaving us all gasping for air and meaning among the wires and sine waves. Hooks that are here today, gone tomorrow. Which makes sense when you consider what Ciani told   not too long ago: “My place isn’t much of an investment because it’s right on a cliff and someday it’ll fall into the sea…. When it’s gone, it’s gone.” —", "genre": []}

Ultimate Painting stumbled out endearingly with their eponymous 2014   for  , a loose jaunt through a variety of melodic spaces.

{"album": "Lisa Marie Airplane Tour", "artist": "So Cow", "description": "So Cow’s Brian Kelly has always been a model of self-sufficiency. Though he tours with a full band, and even enlisted a bassist and drummer for 2014’s  , he tends to create his studio albums on his own. Early So Cow records were lo-fi affairs, bolstered by strident, defiant guitar riffs and the occasional primitive keyboard line. True to form, Kelly recorded, mixed and played every instrument on the new  , but this time, his artistic solitude wasn’t borne of aesthetics but geography—specifically, Kelly’s recent move to the Irish coastal town of Spiddal:  . Kelly addresses the isolating nature of his new residence on the album’s opening track, “What Makes A Man Start Gorse Fires?”: “Three months in, still getting looks from strangers/ Constant danger in the queue for cans.” That experience of feeling out of phase (and finding it difficult to connect with the people who matter most) permeates most of  . “Disengagement” speaks to Kelly’s tenuous faith in the mysterious, whether it’s practicing religion, or time-worn work rituals; On “Wait It Out,” he expresses paranoia over Big Brother-level invasions of privacy; and on “Something More” and “Batman, Tonight,” he grapples with paralyzing romantic fear. Kelly’s unsentimental vocals add a matter-of-fact tone to his songs; he’s torn up about them, but resigned to their presence in his life. Musically, however,   was clearly emboldened by his experiences working with a full band. The record is brash, tart indie-pop that recalls both the shambling tone of New Zealand’s legendary lo-fi scene (c.f.,  ,  ) as well as  ’ erudite folk-punk. Unraveling guitars with an off-kilter sense of balance give “At Home” a ’90s throwback feel, while the fuzzy, proto-metal guitar solo on “No Trades” is a sly wink to the song’s lyrical namechecking of Thin Lizzy. Kelly’s gift for taut arrangements means  ’s messier moments— a distorted, comet-tail guitar solo on “Asleep On A Bus,” the deconstructed jazz interlude near the end of “Westerly Direction”—never derail or undermine the songs. If anything, these outbursts of turbulence amplify Kelly’s personal uncertainty.   acutely captures the disorientation that accompanies emotional and physical dislocation. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Statea", "artist": "Murcof x Vanessa Wagner", "description": "Ambient and classical music have a lot in common and a vast chasm between them. Both have texture, tone, and tests of patience that promise certain rewards. But the making of each—one usually by means of electronic processing, and the other most often by hand—signals different origins and different priorities. For the cross-genre collaboration  , two artists—the Mexican ambient producer Murcof and French classical pianist Vanessa Wagner—focused on matters of contrast and commonality to find a meaningful middle ground. The duo came together under the aegis of InFiné, a French label with curious ears (the company motto: “easy music for the hard to please”), and settled on a cast of celebrated modern and contemporary composers to both of their liking. The result is a sort of crash-course in 20th-century classical music remade in ways that celebrate the source. John Cage comes first with “In a Landscape,” which starts off as a naturalistic solo piano piece before certain notes begin to echo and stretch in ways that suggest more than just ebony and ivory at play. That would be Murcof, working with electronic effects that gradually become more and more pronounced, until it becomes hard to distinguish what is acoustic and what is electric. Giving up that ghost comes as welcome relief as   stretches out stylistically. In “Variations for the Healing of Arinushka,” beatific piano notes divined by Arvo Pärt are greeted delicately by an electronic throb and even beats by the end. In “Avril 14th,” the tables are turned with a track by electronic antagonist Aphex Twin (from his infamous album  ) turned into something more conservatory-inclined, thanks to Wagner’s tender performance. Points of approach vary, so that György Ligeti gets a treatment as dark, moody noise (“Musica Ricercata No. 2”) and Morton Feldman turns to minimal techno murmured in hushed tones (“Piano Piece 1952”). All the while, Murcof and Wagner rise up and down in terms of prominence with a deft sense of when each is needed—and when both can come together as one. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Drakkar Nowhere", "artist": "Drakkar Nowhere", "description": "Daniel Collás has long approached his music with an “everything but the kitchen sink” mentality. With his old group, the NYC-based octet Phenomenal Handclap Band, he created colorful songs by weaving together strands of disco, pop, and psych-rock. Yet for all the mesmerizing, polyrhythmic grooves they conjured, their two albums remained somewhat cautious (and occasionally a bit toothless). But with Drakkar Nowhere, Collás’ new project with fellow PHB member Morgan Phalen, the duo pushes themselves out of their comfort zone, putting their trust in both rich vocal melodies and finely-textured arrangements. Written largely in a rented house in Stockholm, Sweden, with a gaggle of local musicians including members of rock bands Dungen and the Amazing, Drakkar Nowhere is Collás and Phalen’s strongest, and most eccentric, work to date. While PHB grounded itself in the music of the ‘80s, Drakkar Nowhere finds its reference points in early psychedelic rock. The album opens with “Any Way,” where sweet piano and crystalline vocal lines are a delightful dead ringer for the Zombies’ “This Will be Our Year,” before things move into headier territory. True to its name, “Higher Now” delivers a barrage of intergalactic synths over a hypnotic, deep bass loop, and “Did It Ever?” boasts an unironic flute in the vein of Jethro Tull’s “Aqualung.” While the expansive and mostly-instrumental closing track “Salutation to the Sun” drifts a bit into  Stonehenge” territory with its drum freakout and Gregorian monk vocals, it maintains an elegance that overrides any whimsical or parodic read. Throughout their debut as Drakkar Nowhere, Collás and Phalen haven’t abandoned their affinity for musical hodge-podge as much as they’ve tackled it, demonstrating a newfound, and bold, sense of adventure. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "MOUTHTRIP", "artist": "KAGAMI smile.", "description": "KAGAMI smile. doesn’t produce the kind of electronic music that gets the dance floor moving.   his fractured concoctions as “broken house” and “cellular footwork,” his idiosyncratic songs are full of wily left-turns, abstract soundscapes, and erratic beats that make it impossible for crowds to move their bodies with any semblance of unison. Previous releases like July’s   were better left to people who tend to react to music cerebrally rather than physically. While  undoubtedly offers a break from such a loose framework, it too encourages a similar detachment from the body. Tracks like the volatile “MITOCHONDRIA” and the jittery “CELLDIVISION” sport inhospitable rhythms and atomic melodies, defying the listener to follow along with anything other than mute amazement. This kind of maximalist approach is a perfect fit for a 21st-century typified by “information overload” and “media saturation.” Yet as chaotic and as disembodied as  ’s attack often feels, it’s remarkable just how deeply affecting songs like the swirling “LASHDREAM” and the near-heavenly “T HRT D RP” are. Their airy electronics resonate stealthily, too disjointed and slippery to ever fully register on a conscious level. But just because the listener can’t pinpoint their every movement and evolution doesn’t mean they don’t register on an emotional level. —", "genre": []}

Neige calls Alcest “the musical testimony” of a real-life dream world   in his childhood, “where a faraway and celestial music floats in the air like a perfume.” His musical interpretation of that mysterious place traverses black metal, shoegaze, dreampop, and new age music. On  , Neige and drummer Winterhalter sound like they’ve fallen back in love with metal, after 2014’s  almost entirely removed it from the mix. The result is the most satisfying Alcest record in nearly a decade.  keeps one foot in Alcest’s dream world while turning to Japanese art and culture for additional influence.

The shadow of Japan certainly looms over  , especially in its ’90s RPG synth textures and its manga-inspired cover art. Yet it’s the album’s reverence for the black metal of the group’s earliest days that really makes it work. The title track is a reminder of Neige’s deftness as a guitarist, as he oscillates between savage tremolo-picked riffs and cleaner passages. His screamed vocals on “Eclosion” and “Oiseaux de Proie” are raw, and set between gorgeous, pastoral sections, providing the powerful contrast that the best of this artier strain of metal offers. Alcest was one of the first black metal bands to openly bathe their music in sunlight.   shows that they still know how to use the darkness. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "A Loud Bash of Teenage Feelings", "artist": "Beach Slang", "description": "Philly trio   basically had two avenues to explore after their 2015 debut  , an album-length diatribe against growing old. James Alex and Co. could have continued to explore that record’s quieter moments, growing progressively introspective and, God forbid, “mature.” Or, they could have doubled down on the crash and pop. As evidenced by the first few seconds of “Future Mixtape for the Art Kids,” Alex opted for the latter. “Play it loud/ Play it fast,” he implores, an opening salvo that makes no apologies for staying right in the established Beach Slang sonic and lyrical pocket.   is more brash and hardcore than  , and in its full-throttle approach, it feels more like a debut than sophomore release. It’s as if the band still felt they had something to prove. Beach Slang make anthems that tap into the indie rock ethos of “our band could be your life,” igniting that heart-spark discovery when someone speaks your language, and capturing the reckless energy of living three lifetimes in one night. It’s all epic, and for the most part, it continues to work. The one track that feels forced, “Atom Bomb,” taps back into the hardcore past of Alex’s former band  , but it never really captures that band’s ebullience. The rest of the album clicks along at an almost unbearably fast pace, pausing only to tip its hat to Alex’s hero Paul Westerberg on standouts “Wasted Daze of Youth” and “Young Hearts.” Both songs are big, major-chord salutes to gutter fuckups and desperately wasted dreamers. While Slang salutes their heroes openly, what makes this band so special is Alex’s heart. It’s all over the record: open, unencumbered by allegory or cheap sentimentality. It will be interesting to see where the band goes from here because, for unabashed teenage revelry,   says it all. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Jealous Fires", "artist": "The Gospel Truth", "description": "The Gospel Truth came up in the same fertile Austin garage-punk scene that birthed Roky Erickson and Gerard Cosloy’s   compilations. Yet despite some superficial links—they’re on Cosloy’s 12XU label, share a producer with   and  , and their guitarist sometimes drums for  —this scorched-earth post-punk outfit bears very little resemblance to the average Nuggets-tripping, 6th Street-roaming garage group. The spit, snarl, and echo on their second full-length recalls the feral catharsis of the Birthday Party—there are, after all,  . This is the Gospel Truth’s second full-length album, following 2013’s  , and it increases the flow of chaotic, unhinged energy through tightly constructed rhythms. “Jealous Fires,” the opening track, is also the album’s best, with its rusty-knife guitar slashes and frenetic stabs of rapid bass. Patrick Travis wreaks terse chaos with six strings, bassist David Petro counterpunches violently from below, and drummer Brandon Crowe holds the whole thing in shape with crisp, dry rhythms. Mechanically precise—but also highly flammable—the cut clanks, jitters, and abrades, full of abrupt millisecond stops and starts, the kind that startle like jolts of electricity. Over this racket, singer Mike Tonucci moans and howls, his voice shrouded in spooky reverb; he sounds a bit like Jim Morrison fronting Fire Engines. None of the album’s other tracks quite reach this apex, though the austere, staccato “Heaven Is Ugly” ratchets up the skeletal tension and “32” piles on a feverish, enraged jangle,   the Nightingales. The album swerves briefly into the conventional with “You Don’t Want Us” and “Hunger Artist,” a pair of sludgy blues-rockers.

For  , the means of music-making have been expanded greatly, thanks to the range of remixers, but the woody simplicity is never lost.

Ambient maestro Tim Hecker turns in a highly detailed mix that hones in on each of the many manic mallet strikes, and spins them around to create broadened soundscape. The remix by Fennesz introduces some of his dreamy, disruptive digital fizz, while Oneohtrix Point Never adds elements of piano, strings, and insectoid electronics. The stylistic range is more varied than might be expected, from rhythmic noise (via Greg Saunier, drummer of the art-prog band Deerhoof) to delay-effect fantasias (Ian Williams of Battles) to an appealingly inappropriate piece featuring acoustic guitar (the rarely-not-eccentric Squarepusher).

{"album": "The Sorrow You’ve Been Toting Around", "artist": "Scooterbabe", "description": ", the first proper full-length from indiepop band Scooterbabe, wastes no time diving headfirst into uncertainty. “Late October, I came over/ I should’ve warned you, nothing good can come of this,” J.J. Posway sings on “Whitedwarf/Late October.” Two songs later, on “Deathscene/Half Decade,” the situation has worsened. “Slipping too far into that dreaded mood,” Posway sings. “Before you knew it, you gave up on a half decade of dating.” Those sentiments are a good indication of what to expect on   a record shot through with angst and existential despair. On “Our Last Game Of Chess,” Posway grapples with the realization that early life decisions—”before we’re given the privilege to determine who we are”—determine future directions, while the protagonist of “Kneel To See Me” is overwhelmed that his own depression caused an ex pain, despairing that he’s still “getting no sleep, still living transient by design.” The arrangements are spacious and wistful, with spare, structural drumming and occasional flashes of color, such as trumpet or violin. “Kneel To See Me” is a hushed acoustic elegy with faded piano, its melancholy curlicues of guitar nodding toward ’90s indie and emo; the ramshackle “Sermon,” with its brisk, tumbling rhythms, has all the sprightliness of vintage jangle-pop. For all its anxiety,  remains driving and buoyant. Guest vocalist Jianna Justice adds lilting melodies and backing harmonies throughout (most notably on the Lemuria-esque “Sick Spine”), which mesh perfectly with Posway’s proudly vulnerable voice. And then there’s the playfully self-loathing “Voice Memo,” which lives up to its title. Posway cedes vocal responsibilities to guitarist Evan Tyor, who sounds like he’s singing directly into a phone. Faint keyboards hum in the background as Tyor quietly murmurs, “Everybody hates me/ Super lonely/ Super duper, duper lonely.” When he gets to the end of the line, his voice cracks with laughter. It’s a welcome moment of levity, revealing that, beneath all of their sorrow, Scooterbabe’s sense of humor remains intact.

{"album": "The Olympians", "artist": "The Olympians", "description": "If you take their press release at face value, The Olympians began with a recurring dream of mythic proportion. One night, while touring Greece with soul ensemble Lee Fields and the Expressions, keyboardist Toby Pazner was visited in his sleep by a toga-clad, curly-haired gentleman who told him to return to New York and build a “Temple of Sound” to honor the music of Ancient Greece. After the dream persisted night after night, Pazner gave in. When he got home, he began amassing a collection of top-notch gear and a who’s-who of NYC soul session players—not terribly hard for a key member of the Daptone universe—and began constructing his homage. While certain logistical obstacles make it difficult to verify Pazner’s dream, the group’s origin myth is rendered moot by the radiance and gravity of their fully instrumental debut album. Many of the Olympians play in groups held together by a powerful human voice—they’ve backed Fields, Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley—and part of the thrill here is seeing how they adapt to that lack of an easy focal point. In the process, they’ve built a series of highly-nuanced arrangements that remain engaging even as they hypnotize, and listening to the Olympians feels akin to floating on a salty sea. While these songs all feature booming horns, it’s the addition of more subtle instruments, like bells, harp, vibes and a smattering of guitar, that give each song (all of which are named after a planet or an element of Greek mythology, natch) distinct personalities and character. “Mars” features a harp and bass combination that evokes a mellower version of Flying Lotus’ “Drips/Auntie’s Harp,” while “Mercury’s Odyssey” is a more up-tempo jaunt bound together by a thicket of guitars and keys. And even though we never hear a human voice, the album sneaks in a handful of terrific solos, from the flute on opening track “Sirens of Jupiter” to the stately trumpet on “Venus,” to serve a similar role. While the Olympians may have originally taken shape halfway around the world, their debut—held together by an overflowing well of virtuosic talent—hits home. —", "genre": []}

The two recorded their self-titled debut in fits and starts between Dust’s apartment in Nottingham, England and Mockasin’s place in Wellington, New Zealand. The resulting album is charmingly unorthodox, landing squarely in the Roxy Music art-pop tradition. Opening track “Relaxed Lizard” plays like scrambled disco, flavored with bongos. “Jealous Lies” is reggae funk with strategically-placed synths. “In Love” is a languid R&B song with exotic beats, instrumental fills, and layered vocals. Hearing two different male voices layered atop one another is still relatively uncommon—even moreso when each boasts a distinct falsetto. “Alive Without Medicine” is surf rock for stoned surfers, and the woozy synths and glimpses of percussive funk keep it floating in the stratosphere. Though Soft Hair borrows from an eclectic batch of genres, their sound is remarkably cohesive—falsetto vocals, dreamy synths, and Will Ricketts’ masterful percussion blending seamlessly.

The album’s title, according to Blu, refers to, “a young squire from Los Angeles, running around the streets of Paris, doing a bunch of ‘illegal’ shit while he creates an album.” The music it contains is appropriately freewheeling, full of rich, bass-heavy, jazz-funk. Lyrically, the album finds Blu at his most braggadocious, as if he took the bars he spit on  ’s “ ,” and spread them out across an entire project.

Opener “LA Counting” is all flossin’ and shit-talk over sun-kissed, gloss-funk production.

The first two are mostly a consequence of the third.   was an iconic British show that aired in the 1980s and ’90s, full of cockney rhyming slang, get-rich-quick hustles and deep-fried fish and chips. The backdrop was dilapidated, underserved and surprisingly white. Peckham, and its neighboring area Camberwell, form one of the most ethnically-diverse pockets of the United Kingdom. It’s a cultural melting pot of Black African, Black Caribbean, Asian, Indian, White British, and many other ethnicities. For 25 years, it’s been home to some of my family; Vietnamese who pitched up there in the early ’90s and have since made it the home of a new generation of British-born children. Over the quarter-century, they’ve seen the area develop from the destitution depicted on   into one of the capital’s most exciting cultural centers. It’s where South East Londoners Yussef Dayes and Kamaal Williams—releasing music together as Yussef Kamaal—came together as teenagers in 2007, bringing their brand of smooth jazz to small crowds in local bars. Dayes and Williams didn’t plan much before their live performances. They laid out a chord progression, but beyond that, the pair would just  , slinking their sound into whatever sonic corners it shifted to organically. That freewheeling approach can be felt on  , their first album. Call it the Great Camberwell Record—a work that beautifully distills the area, mixing cultures deep into the album grooves. It’s a jazz record in the spirit of Blue Note’s finest recordings, but this sonic stew incorporates boogie, afrobeat, funk, hip-hop and the spirit of Roy Ayers, too. The arrangements are satin-smooth. The drums are crisp and funky, and the bass floats majestically throughout the record. “Yo Chavez” is built around a squelchy synth that’s pure aural candy. The bass-heavy bounce of “Lowrider” takes the curbs with a cosmic swagger. It’s ’67 Chevy tour of South East London, with nothing but sleek tarmac under the tires. Closer “Joint 17” encapsulates the album’s freewheeling excellence. The keys purr with soft sophistication, and are accented with popping bass and snaps.

{"album": "Ohio", "artist": "Earth Tongues", "description": "A look at the lineup of New York’s Earth Tongues—tuba player  , percussionist  , and trumpeter  —might give some listeners pause. How, exactly, do those components work together, especially within the conventions of improvised music? But Earth Tongues doesn’t just improvise in the standard terms; they’ve developed their own intuitive rule system and “language.” Texture, color, and interplay are usually the key components in freely-improvised music, but this slow-moving beast of a combo goes heavier and deeper than surface aesthetics. Together, they create harrowing environments where sounds emerge from silence—colliding, disintegrating, and wriggling in unexpected directions. The music hovers more than it moves, a lumbering, low-impact, largely unpitched din constructed of minimalist gestures, extended technique flurries, and multiple varieties of friction. The two-part work, clocking in at 94 minutes, requires a certain degree of patience, if not total submission. The effort is rewarded.   delivers a kind of immersive ambience that almost feels like a field recording. The album cover features a nighttime shot of a fallen branch and leaves nestled within moss-covered boulders, and the sounds contained here fill out that picture. Objects are rubbed, horns quietly blubber, pre-recorded sounds on cassettes are smeared into abstraction, and, once in awhile, a recognizable brassy tone coalesces. There are moments when the pieces glide into a more intentional sphere, with unhurried build-ups that produce sudden percussive rumbles, suggesting a Martin Denny soundtrack for the apocalypse. More often, though, the performances breathe patiently, murmuring like metallic cicadas, elongated bird calls, and distant wolf howls. Earth Tongues maintains this sound world over the long haul, delivering ever-shifting details and fleeting drama that keep the attentive listener riveted. Given the right listener and environment, this is a record that could be downright transportative.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Tumblers From the Vault", "artist": "Syrinx", "description": "After a tumultuous decade of musical experimentation lead by Cage and Boulez in the concert hall and the Beatles on the radio, the ’70s lurched forward. Enter John Mills-Cockell, a Toronto-born synth explorer blessed by contact with the electronic avant-garde early in his teens, and his cohorts: the freeform saxophonist Doug Pringle and mystic/percussionist Alan Wells. The trio emerged piecemeal and coincidentally: cross-Canadian train trips, visits from the good doctor Timothy Leary, work with Cream producer Felix Pappalardi, interdisciplinary coffeehouse happenings. And yet, a peaceful, studied stillness emanates from the spare output of their group, Syrinx. The   label collects both of the group’s albums and a smattering of live recordings and other ephemera on  : a sumptuous feast for curious listeners. In the handful of non-album material we find the group’s one claim to fame: the song “Tillicum”, commissioned by the CTV television network as the theme for a  -esque current affairs program called “Here Come The Seventies.” “Tillicum” is a pithy introduction to Syrinx’s ambitious music; bookended by coast-to-coast washes of oscillating waves, the song races on a track of vaguely robotic, bubbling rhythm, with Pringle’s sax calling Reveille over top. You can easily imagine the accompanying bustling montage of industrious Canadian life, ushering in the churn of a new decade. The single charted briefly (an instrumental made up of keyboard noise, drum machine, sax and no vocals!) and there’s probably Canadians of a certain age still humming it to this day. Plunging into the rest of Syrinx’s discography, one finds far more pastoral pleasures. RVNG has seen fit to sequence the group’s second album first; it’s the lone album they recorded outright as a unit and the most powerful evidence of their power as a band. “Long Lost Relatives” finds the group already in flight from the start, with Pringle’s ochre-hued sax introducing the proceedings on “Tumblers,” before Mills-Cockell’s curlicues of synth tangle with Wells’ charging bongos. “Syren” runs Pringle’s sax through a synthesizer, encrusting it with a bit of jurassic might recalling “Lark’s Tongues”-era Crimson, before “December Angel” provides one of the set’s high points. After a cacophonous minute of scrapes, clangs and insect-like wails, Mills-Cockell’s Moog keys appear, Verne-like, far beneath the Earth’s surface. Slowly, the strings of a borrowed orchestra emerge, as cascading plucks, bells and gongs melt together in a tectonic fluid, thrumming and huge, buoyed slowly back to the surface by bubbles of Arp and sax, and the call of some synthetic seagull. It’s a breathtaking piece, and it’s hard to say just what it is. Jazz, classical, prog rock, new age? It’s not altogether clear if the members themselves knew. The songs that close disc one come from the group’s 1970 debut, and contain the most delicate Syrinx output, culled from Mills-Cockell’s solo sessions on organ and synth, with Pringle and Wells later adding sax and hand drum overdubs. These uphold the RVNG reissue ethos of rescuing lost relaxation music. “Chant for Your Dragon King” is a stately processional with an overwhelming sense of wistfulness, like Mike Ratledge playing a funeral march in 14th century Wallachia. ‘Appaloosa-Pegasus’ channels Riley, hitching buzzing synth to Wells’ galloping tabla, while ‘Hollywood Dream Trip’ evokes the woozy, implacable bliss-state of  . Syrinx may have only blessed the world with two LPs, but they didn’t waste a moment on each.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Flea Waltz", "artist": "Frederic Robinson", "description": "Some albums seem to have more   in them than others—more space for sound to bounce around.  , the second album from German artist Frederic Robinson, is one of those records. It opens with “Constellations,” a more-or-less familiar form of electronic pop, with breathy vocals supplied by Lily Juniper. But it’s on the second track, “Acrylic,” where Robinson’s spatial acuity becomes clear. The song is full of programmed percussion and melodic synthesizer lines, but they all occupy their own space, arranged with a seeming aversion to density. Cramming that much sound into a song could be dizzying, but Robinson’s clean sense of sound-design steers clear of clutter, arriving instead at a sort of breezy busyness. “Sizzle” follows, operating in a slower mode, making for ideal wind-down dance music. Juniper returns on “Breathing,” her voice coupled with  the kind of pointillist sounds and piano riffs that wouldn’t sound out of place on a composition by Philip Glass. The devotion to variety continues as  expands, journeying through swells of day-glo bass music (“We’ve Been”) and stately lounge (“Shuffle Home”). Juniper reappears to sing in three more songs, but Robinson’s tracks, with their rubbery percussive feel and eloquently specific drum sounds, talk well on their own terms—in a language guided by atmosphere and rhythm more than words. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Telling it Like it Is", "artist": "Marching Church", "description": "One theme of Elias Bender Rønnenfelt’s lyricism and attendant imagery, throughout his varying projects (which also include Iceage, Pagan Youth and Vår), is a sense of bacchanalian splendor, a fixation on boozy glamor and the residual grime revealed by the light of dawn. It’s a familiar theme, with many pitfalls—the proclamations of grandeur that register as uncomfortably un-ironic, the florid raving, the way  , on 2015’s  mistook ensemble incoherence for liberated improvisation.  however, finds Rønnenfelt and a cast of players focused and relatively toned down, having perhaps realized that sleazy nuance and shifty restraint is the best way to explore excess. It’s to the credit of the album overall that the supple, featherweight beauty of single “Heart of Life”—which luxuriates in spare piano and mesh-like percussive texture, exquisitely denying an expected climax—doesn’t outshine the other eight songs. Marching Church is a big band here, with about a dozen players on the record (including, crucially, Lower’s remarkably poised rhythm section), but it sounds like a small one: viola and saxophone, trumpet and flute—they’re garnish and zest, emphasizing and at the right times undercutting Rønnenfelt’s stagy delivery. A legible and resonant metaphor, “Inner City Pigeon” finds Rønnenfelt observant yet detached from urbanites, coasting past windows and “never coming down.” The song, with its atmosphere of velvety murk, makes potent that sense of debauched estrangement that stalks his catalog. Feel how the woozy bass and sagging toms approximate listless, weary flight. That is, until a cymbal bell and skittering, discordant strings sound alarm. It’s a signal, listeners might gather, that when crashing feels impossible, it’s actually inevitable.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Wingbeats", "artist": "Hidden Orchestra", "description": "Think of   by   as a bedroom symphony. Unlike a traditional symphony,   doesn’t require a concert hall or a stage filled with dozens of musicians. Instead, the individual parts are painstakingly pieced together by one person: Brighton, UK, based Joe Acheson. The result is a kind of expansive intimacy. “For as long as I can remember, I have found that what draws me to a piece of music can often be one small detail—a single characteristic or maybe a fleeting moment of beautiful sound or compelling rhythm,” Acheson explains in the album notes. On   that approach is on full display. The first track presents the entire finished composition. Then, the deconstruction begins: Each instrument or layer of sound is relegated to its own track, then listed as numbered “Sources.” Songs like “Wingbeats Source II – Cello” and field recordings like “Wingbeats Source VI – Dawn Chorus” offer up-close looks at the different components of the fully-assembled title track. The entire composition has a meditative force—a sonic balm to counter our age of deep anxiety. On the opening “Wingbeats,  church bells mingle with a flock of birds recorded in the snowy French Alps; a bass clarinet line delivers swelling, lyrical melodies, and a singing saw provides a gentle harmony. Each individual track in   is a 21st century symphony in miniature; taken together, it sounds like bliss. —", "genre": []}

The members of NYC snot-punk trio  , though? They’re not waiting for a narrator to tell their tale; they’d rather flip the script on any potential writer’s gaze with a quick eye-roll and crushing, roiling riffage. In Soaker’s story, laid out on their four-song debut EP, you’re just a stand-in for the last human piñata they grew tired of beating. Take “Montauk Blues,” a noise-punk barrage that comes off like Pissed Jeans if they swapped out emotional vomit for the real deal. There’s some churn in the track’s midsection that’s more Kilslug than Killdozer, but it’s too single-minded in its delirium to approach psychedelia. Throughout the EP, burly chord triplets brawl with relentless feedback before inevitably turning their fists back on you, the onlooker. “Vamp” kicks off with a Flipper-gone-pop progression and kicks it in the head just as quickly.

{"album": "The Source", "artist": "Ted Hearne", "description": "When distraught Army Private Chelsea Manning sent nearly three-quarters of a million classified government documents to WikiLeaks, then confessed as much to hacker Adrian Lamo, surely she had no inkling any of that would eventually transform into art. Composer Ted Hearne used the bureaucratic language from those files and the poetry of her chat transcripts to create  , an electronic opera that honors its subject matter. The show debuted at the The Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival in 2014, and the   later hailed the recording as “one of the best albums of 2015.” Song like “explosive hazard” feature lyrics about “zero damage” followed by drawn-out Auto-tuned voices singing “two civilians killed in action/three civilians wounded in action,” offering new context to these reports from the frontlines. Other tracks such as “I encrypt as much as I can” and the moving “s/as boy/as a boy” use phrases directly lifted from Manning’s online chats, illuminating her own personal identity battle: “I wouldn’t mind going to prison for the rest of my life if it wasn’t for the possibility of having pictures of me… plastered all over the world press… as a boy; the CPU is not made for this motherboard.” As a whole, the album is a pleasantly uncomfortable listen—challenging us to confront ideas of gender, war and music itself through dazzling fireworks of sound. This isn’t easy territory, but it was never meant to be. While he’s tagged his work as “electroacoustic,” “classical,” and “experimental,” Hearne has said that he chose Bandcamp as a platform partially for its flexible categorizations. “The most annoying thing for any artist is that these giant services force you to be in a genre category.

But as the years have gone on, they’ve begun to weather the same accusations that typically plague a band of their stature: they’ve gone stale simply because they’re not young anymore. But to levy those charges is to miss the point; Ulcerate’s lasting impact isn’t their their innovation—it’s their consistency.

On its surface,   seems to present more of the same. It’s got the same monochromatic cover art, the same compact songs, the same abbreviated running time. So it’s a bit of a shock when the 50-second “Lisa’s Song” opens not with a drum roll or an amp squeal, but with tender acoustic guitars. That subdued mood continues for the length of  ; ballad-heavy and strikingly beautiful, the pared-down arrangements serve to highlight Molina’s uncanny gift for melody. “Old Enough to Know” wouldn’t sound out of place on an early Elliott Smith record, guitars pirouetting slowly beneath Molina’s melancholy vocals. “Hung Up on the Dream” is a kind of minimalist “Strawberry Fields Forever,” wheezing mellotron poking holes in the songs papery framework.

In the end, it doesn’t much matter;  ’s chief asset is as a showcase for Molina’s versatility.

Though each record has one foot in hip-hop, Medline’s work is both 100 percent sample-free and mostly instrumental. His latest LP,  , is an expansive, slow-burn record that locates the sweet spot between ‘70s exploitation film soundtracks and French arthouse sex film music.

On “Power to the People,” Corvalan sings directly into the flute, giving his voice a strangely modulated effect that contrasts the song’s layered percussion. The Medline moniker has always brought out Corvalan’s fondness for experimenting. His first tape,  , was an exercise in creating music with live instruments.

The UK duo Sun Palace achieved that honor in 1983, when “Rude Movements,” the B-side to their 1983 12″ “Winning,” became a staple of The Loft, Mancuso’s exclusive, invite-only dance party. The song developed during a jam session in a home studio between Mike Collins and Keith O’Connell. Because neither Collins nor O’Connell is a drummer, they built the track on a hissy-but-sinuous Roland CR-78 analog rhythm machine beat. Thanks the deft interplay of looming synths and soul-jazz guitars, “Rude Movements” played out like the offspring of cosmic disco and jazz fusion, a masterpiece of immersive smoothness, made DIY style.

{"album": "Love Songs: Part Two", "artist": "Romare", "description": "If the satirical quip “everyone’s a DJ” is true, then it also stands to reason that it’s just a matter of time before everyone’s an EDM producer too. Though a career in nightlife, like any other “creative” job, can be often a nauseating farce of self-congratulation, there are still times when the process leads to vibrant and inspired work. Case in point: London-based dance producer  , who started his career as a cut-and-paste renderer of archived blues, gospel, and soul. On his first three releases, Romare navigated stacks of these samples, embellishing them with deep, lurching beats to create moody, downtempo sounds. On November’s  , Romare’s second full-length, he expands both conceptually (“every nook and cranny of the romantic impulse,” reads the album’s copy) and compositionally, leaning less on borrowed music in favor of building tracks with an array of live instruments. One of Romare’s most common construction methods is to anchor melodies in pronounced vocal samples. On “All Night,” it’s a raspy blues wail that has the same immediacy as Moby circa  . On “Je T’aime” and “Come Close to Me,” the melodies have the same ebb and flow as a murmuring Four Tet track. On his previous efforts, Romare used vocal melodies to guide and inform the remaining rhythmic elements. On tracks like “Honey” and “New Love,” however, Romare uses vocals unpredictably, as a foil for the rhythms rather than a lead. This subtle compositional growth, and the songs that result, make  feel refreshingly expansive. Conceptually, Romare’s exploration of love yields a few different interpretations on the theme. On opener “Who To Love?”, he leaves things open-ended; on “Who Loves You?” he scratches at uncertainty, loneliness, and anxiety, fusing urgent bass thumps with sinister string layers. On “Come Close to Me,” an album standout and possibly Romare’s finest track to date, he offers an enveloping atmosphere of keyboards and swelling synth loops, equally seductive and elegant, as a way of conjuring the idea of intimacy. More often than not,   strikes bass-charged electronic dance gold.   is an endearing and rewarding milestone on Romare’s journey as an artist, bringing theme and composition into harmony.

Nine minutes into “Part I,” the landscape suddenly shifts from a simple, two-note lullabye to what sounds like digital windchimes caught in a strong breeze. The tight cluster of notes repeats over and over, ocean roaring behind them, neither gaining nor losing strength. The net effect is weirdly calming, the twinkling keyboards becoming as regular and expected as the next heartbeat. “Part II” is even more translucent; the ocean keeps going, but the synth lines sound like they’re being played in a grotto far below. There are no sharp edges to the sounds on  ; everything is low and flutelike. The album ends with a simple, five-note melody plunked out on what sounds like a computerized kettle drum, the space between each note big enough to contain a whole other song.   doesn’t command attention or dazzle with complexity. It simply invites you to disappear inside of it for a while. —", "genre": []}

It took Sergio Leone, an Italian director, to elevate the American Western film genre to an artform. Decades later, Italian trio  are ramping classic country and rockabilly influences up to a frenzied, pace—fitting for a group whose name is apparently a homespun word that means “beautiful hysteria.” The band’s self-titled debut goes from soulful and harmony-driven (“River,” which sounds less like a song that was written than one that washed up on shore) to unapologetically badass (“Maybe Wrong”) to skittering and unhinged (“Let Me Down,” which sounds like a Riot Grrrl take on Cab Calloway). But it’s not just Kalahysteri’s country of origin that makes the trio special. The record could have been recorded in Brooklyn just as easily as Montebelluna, Italy. It’s the fact that the trio found this music, took it by the throat and squeezed: Kalahysteri’s is an urgent, big-tent brand of Americana, a small reminder that the U.S. can export more than just fear, and that what echoes back across the ocean is often a revelation. —", "genre": []}

On his second full-length,  , the Tokyo-bred DJ broadens his scope of source material with an adventurous, thrilling set of intricate instrumentals that bear little resemblance to its predecessor. Inspired by the discovery of  , a collection of obscure West African instrumentals from the 70’s, Anchorsong, who takes his name from Bjork’s 1993 “The Anchor Song,” emphasizes and incorporates complex rhythmic constructions and an expansive array of Afrobeat samples on  touching everything from surf rock to New Wave along the way. “Mother,” “Last Feast,” and “Butterfly,” which merge polyrhythmic structures with brief, indistinguishable vocal snippets and crisp house beats, are the perfect showcases for Yoshida’s Afro-house hybrids. Even a song like “Expo,” which begins with a more traditional bass-driven sonic palette, continues to slowly build as Yoshida adds elements like guitar, hand drums, and marimbas to dense, stunning effect. There are no cheap payoffs or ready-made club hits on  Instead, it’s an album that rewards repeated listens and careful attention. It seamlessly blends the DJ’s house minimalism with his newfound artistic vision, and the result is one of the most exciting instrumental LPs of the past year. —", "genre": []}

Though some naysayers claim their hardcore past is a liability, the fact that the group’s core members have spent time in bands like   and Cause for Alarm is actually an asset.

Their latest full-length,  draws on the group’s expansive influences, While peers like Watain hinted at hard rock inspiration on their 2013 LP  , Black Anvil’s approach feels more seamless. “Nothing” features Pink Floyd-y keyboards, plus some Uli Roth-era Scorpions soloing by guitarist Jeremy Sosville. The slower moments of the title track wouldn’t be out of place on Kiss’s  . Thematically, the album tends toward a cerebral interpretation of the Satanic; rather than focusing on the demonic mythos, Black Anvil are more concerned with internal struggles, and the necessary balance between darkness and light (See: “As an Elder Learned Anew” and “Two Keys: Here’s the Lock”). And indeed, Black Anvil prove themselves here as masters of equilibrium—the fluidity of stylistic and thematic tensions results in an album that is creative and challenging, the next step in their quest to push USBM forward, with hearty hails to the dark energies of the recent past.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Overnight", "artist": "Heat", "description": " are from Montreal, and they formed in the early ‘10s, but their music sounds like it comes from the UK in the early ‘80s—the exact moment when the dour nihilism of bands like Joy Division and Section 25 were giving way to the romantic disaffection of the Psychedelic Furs and Echo & the Bunnymen. Like those bands, Heat have mastered the classic trick of dressing up pristine pop choruses in rain macs, fingerless gloves, and army boots so that they can convincingly bum cigs from the art kids after school. The aptly-titled   is a long, boozy odyssey through city streets after the bars have closed; there’s love—or, more accurately, lust—on the record, but the overriding sense is that all of these scenarios are playing out in the protagonist’s head as he trips from corner to corner under the pink streetlights. It’s closest in tone to the   episode “ ,” vocalist Susil Sharma rifling through past liaisons in his brain over the course of a single, blurry night. The lyrics, appropriately, evoke Verlaine—both Tom and Paul. There’s Jane the libertine, Buddha, Christ, and a “Joan of Arc of teenage lust,” all of which would land with a loud clang if they weren’t surrounded by sumptuous, black-velvet guitars and delivered in Sharma’s coolly detached, bored-lothario vocals. (Despite being born in New Brunswick and living in Canada, Sharma sounds impressively British throughout). Every song on   is immaculately constructed; big, pealing guitars kick out unapologetically melodic leads, basslines roam anxiously among thumping percussion, Sharma seethes and sneers; every element joins forces for soaring,   choruses. All of this sounds like a series of backhanded compliments, but it’s not:   stuns because every element is meticulously arranged to deliver maximum emotional impact. Wry verses explode into beaming refrains like a bitter cynic suddenly discovering true love. “The Unknown” opens with a clarion call of guitar and works its way into a chorus that struts and pouts with confidence. “Still, Soft” is almost entirely submerged in feedback, but the “doot-doot-doot” refrain bobbles its way cheerily to the top. And “Lush” is sewn up in sparkling spiderwebs of guitar, which gorgeously offset Sharma’s chiaroscuro vocal. By the end of  , Sharma has found his way out of the city and is walking along the beach, sun coming up, “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” floating above his head. It’s a surprisingly optimistic ending to a record that spends most of its time fusing pop immediacy with emotional distance. Needless to say, its chorus is tremendous. — ", "genre": []}
{"album": "LNLNN", "artist": "Gidge", "description": "Jonatan Nilsson and Ludvig Stolterman grew up together in the small city of Umeå in the northern part of Sweden, an area that endures lengthy, freezing winters. As Gidge, their field of expertise is electronica—specifically, the liminal space between ambient music and techno. Such music used to be umbilically linked to visions of futurism or modernity but, as with like-minded producers such as Christian Löffler or Ólafur Arnalds’ Kiasmos project, Gidge pursue something more in line with their immediate environment: a wintery, organic electronica that recalls the frosted forests they call home. LNLNN collects seven tracks, all new—sort of. The starting point for the LP was  , an album and film project made in conjunction with the production company Lamprey that explored the strange ambience of a cabin in which Stolterman was living, perched right on the edge of the wilderness. The result was desolate and atmospheric, but when they performed it live, Nilsson and Stolterman filled it out with new beats and textures, and soon it grew into a record in its own right. The result captures the eeriness and desolation of  , while adding a rhythmic quality that transforms and amplifies the material. “Eyes Open” and “White Curtains” wind mournful keys around beats sampled from struck wood and metal the pair scavenged from their wild surroundings. “Lit,” with its garage-y drums and haunted vocal, sounds like Burial transported to the edge of the Arctic Circle. But the album’s standout is “Midra,” where an unwavering, pulse-like rhythm winds through gusts of distortion and billowing, Enya-like vocals. It feels like a long walk through an icy wilderness, wrapped up warm in defiance of the elements. —", "genre": []}

Byrne’s musical takes on the hardships of love, the crossroads of change, and the uncertainty of decision-making were already honed and poignant, even then. , her follow-up, finds Byrne settled into a life in Brooklyn after years spent criss-crossing the country—Buffalo, Chicago, Seattle—and reflecting on the unresolved narratives that arose through years of transient living. While she seems to be tentatively embracing homesteading at the moment, the sweeping ambient soundscapes and lush, fingerpicked melodies of Not Even Happiness are an able device for working out the tension between her new stability and the piece of her spirit that still longs for the constant movement, could’ve-been loves, and starry roadside nights she’s left behind. In “Follow My Voice”, Byrne’s guitar thrums gently, but her low-range vocals are twisted by a lyrical love-hate relationship with a former home. “Melting Grid” is a wistful, harmonica-driven folk song in which Byrne reflects on the all-consuming loneliness of a life without roots. With strings weeping over mesmeric chord progressions, obvious standout “Natural Blue” is an ode to the fantasy of infinite freedom. When Byrne croons the words “When I first saw you/ The sky, it was such a natural blue,” it’s as if she’s fixing a mantra for herself to ensure she never forgets the strong connections between her emotional life and the natural world. In album closer “I Live Now As A Singer,” Byrne asks herself, “Tell me what it’s like to be here now.” Her battles with her restless heart against the strange appeal of stability resonates in a world where even the best-laid plans can be disrupted at a moment’s notice.  ’ gorgeous production and arrangements are just spare enough not to crowd out her earnest honesty.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Cut to the Chafe", "artist": "Thurst", "description": "Los Angeles trio   wear their outsider status with pride on  , a 14-song blast of punk anxiety that dials down the snotty playground taunts of their first release,  (an acronym for “You’re So Fucking Cool”). Instead, they embrace the complexities of a full-on, grown-up existential crisis. “I’ve euthanized my youth,” guitarist and singer Kory Seal proclaims on opening track “Forever Poser,” setting the tone for what’s to come. Throughout the record, Thurst wrestle with dualities that never get resolved, and aren’t really meant to. They debate going out vs. staying in, judging vs. being judged, being cool vs. being yourself—i.e. uncool. The band employ few effects or overdubs, instead doubling down on their unvarnished quality without sacrificing fidelity. Seal’s voice is front and center, his words spittle-flecked and emphatic, with sister and drummer Jessie occasionally adding harmonies while holding down a solid backbeat. Where   had a more laid back, Feelies- type vibe, here the music recalls the post-punk pockets of ’90s indie, as well as the sad-sack parts of the Weezer discography. Though primarily an observational record,   isn’t afraid to go for the jugular when it counts. The lyrics take issue with complacency of any kind, saving a special irritation for complacency that’s cloaked in symbols of rebellion, like long hair (“Their unoriginality is starting to rub off on me”) or belligerent anti-government attitudes (“‘Fuck the government,/Somebody told me/That still counts as an excuse”). It’s also, at times, very funny, especially when Kory slides into the POV of someone he claims to hate in order to unleash a few biting “that’s so L.A.” bon mots: “Earlier in the song/ I was trying to express/Me and most fashion bloggers, we don’t get along.” Each song feels like a retort to the last. On “Electric Bill,” Kory bemoans his shut-in lifestyle with a crack about receiving a single phone call in a week (wrong number!) before diving into a drug-fueled bender on the very next track. He complains about living paycheck-to-paycheck, then follows it up with “Struggling Artist,” a flippant kiss-off to a bourgeois bohemian lifestyle that ends with the siblings harmonizing on the pointed rejoinder: “There’s no such thing as writer’s block/ if you’ve never come up with anything.” When his gaze turns inward on the searing, personal “Alienation”, Seal reacts with a shrug: “I try so hard to think of what I could possibly be but…I’m always just gonna be me.” By the time the album winds down with a short, spoken-word, boozy-party sequence (Weezer, remember?),  has lived up to its title. Though it will surely rattle some cages, this record will play well with listeners who relate to the old adage, “If you haven’t got anything nice to say about anybody, come sit by me.” —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Bye Bye Berta", "artist": "Palberta", "description": "Palberta’s seventh release,  , opens with “Why Didn’t I?,” a song built on sparse percussion and out-of-sync guitars that serve as a foundation over which the trio of Lily Konigsberg, Anina Ivry-Block, and Nina Ryser can harmonize. “Why didn’t I/ Say a thing like that?/ My Friend, didn’t I/ Say a thing like that?” It takes a full two minutes for the lyrics’ anxiety and insecurity to fully seep in and, as soon as they do, an irregular guitar scale moves in from the back of the recording, ending the song in a far different place from where it began. In that respect, the song acts as a perfect encapsulation of the album’s aesthetic: No track is too similar, but each is made up of distinct parts that build a complicated—but cohesive—whole. Palberta met at Bard College and spent playing in and around Hudson Valley before ending up in Philadelphia. That transitory history colors the album; “Jaws” has an industrial quality that mimics the pace of a new city. “Bells,” the song that immediately follows, has a ringing, pastoral feel. New York City no-wave skronk is revitalized in the first half of “Trick Ya.” is 20 tracks long, with most songs clocking in around a minute—in other words, it goes a lot of places but it doesn’t stay in any of them for too long. Palberta are often compared to legendary acts like  and  , but on  , Palberta seem more fascinated with movement and structure than either of those groups.

That Dream Wave earnestly covers Beat Happening’s “fourteen” is wonderfully on the nose.

At just under 20 minutes,   is full of emotionally open songs dealing with change and separation. On “she’s already moved on,” the album’s opener, Young pieces together memories of someone he’s left behind (“tried to memorize your face / so I don’t have to say goodbye”). According to the little context Young provides for the album, these songs were recorded prior to his leaving Nashville for college. The album’s introspective tone seems to signal the discomfort with newness that often accompanies a new life chapter. But it’s not all homesick gloom; the instrumental “feel better” has a cheerful country twang, and in “tell her how you feel,” Young audibly sniffles before almost breaking into a laugh. Taken in full,   perfectly captures the unease of an unfamiliar bed, the quiet longing for old friends, and the desire for home’s simple comforts.

{"album": "Ripping Death” b/w “Riddle of Steel", "artist": "Zig Zags", "description": "Though   hail from present-day Los Angeles, their sound is often an uncanny ringer for speed metal demos from the Bay Area circa 1983 by the likes of Exodus or Testament. The jagged-edged high-school notebook font of their logo isn’t the only thing the band borrows from Metallica’s  ; they’ve learned all the right lessons about playing as loud, as fast, and as recklessly as possible. Entries into their badass catalogue have been distributed via contemporary West Coast labels such as Thee Oh Sees frontman John Dwyer’s Castle Face and Orange County garage-pop powerhouse Burger Records. The band’s latest release is a two-song seven-inch on Famous Class, a Brooklyn label that has some notable singles by the likes of Ty Segall, Speedy Ortiz and Parquet Courts under its belt. Zig Zags’ four-horsemen-of-the-Apocalypse gallop on new 7-inch single “Ripping Death”/”Riddle of Steel” is an impressive double-sider of searing thrash. No matter how ambitious they get with their pull-offs and hammer-on riffs, there’s no escaping the truth that Zig Zags are a punk band at heart. The single’s A-side, “Ripping Death,” lives up to its B-grade VHS horror nomenclature. It’s straightforward and furious, and for all of its pomp and fiery fretwork showmanship, it could pass for vintage L.A. punk such as Black Flag or Fear with just a moderate shift in drum beats. The real treat of the pairing is the B-Side, “Riddle of Steel,” named for the central motif in  . Metal and fantasy have always been natural pairings, and while the camp factor here hits the ceiling, Zig Zags’ songwriting here is at its most rhythmically driving and heroically melodic, showcasing the breadth of their dynamics via a blend of acoustic and electric instruments, changes in tempo and a keep-on-fighting motivational speech via Jed Maheu’s lyrics: “What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger!” In a way, the band’s mastery of their sound is like the riddle of steel itself: The true strength is in the hand that wields it. —", "genre": []}

It sounds like my teen years in the best way possible: all the nostalgia, none of the actual pain. The Olympia, Washington-Washington D.C. ’90s punk/indie rock connection had existed through the ’80s, but was cemented by  ; coincidentally, the show mentioned in the linked Washington Post piece was also the very first punk show I ever attended (purely because I thought the flyer looked cool, not because I knew anything about any of the bands playing). From there, it grew; bands developed fruitful relationships with one another, and these two insular, peculiar outposts of independent culture grew their names and their draw in the national scene, which was considerably bigger than either city’s square footage. The sounds that developed between the two cities (and their suburbs) over the ’80s and ’90s—  and  , Unrest and  ,   and  —shifted and darkened as the sounds of the underground were snatched up by a mainstream that was hungry for the next Nirvana. It’s this era and circuit to which Soggy Creep so lovingly pay homage, without sounding exactly like any of their predecessors—they’re a little grungy, a little shambly, a little whiny, a little churny. There are the faster ones (“Forgotten Skin,” “Eradicated Man”) and the slower ones (“Shallow Drownings”), but the whole thing never strays too far from the kind of mid-tempo shuffle appropriate for a crowd with their arms crossed and their heads nodding. While their previous EPs worshipped more directly at the altar of Greg Sage, this one has an array of patron saints—we can only hope that the band will, as they suggest on their page, potentially reconvene to explore this dusty territory a bit more. Most of the ’90s-indebted bands getting press these days owe more to Pavement than they do Universal Order of Armageddon; this is a welcome stylistic change to these old ears.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Hard Love", "artist": "Strand of Oaks", "description": "2014’s   served as something of a reinvention for Philadelphia singer-songwriter Timothy Showalter. After a trio of independently-released ethereal folk records, Showalter took bold first steps to transition Strand of Oaks from a hushed whisper to full-on scream. Enlivened by stadium-style arrangements and thunderous guitar heroics, Showalter used   to stare down his demons with unbridled energy and a brutally honest lyrical approach. “I know you cheated on me,” he sang on the title track, “but I cheated on myself.” Showalter explores that forthright, lionhearted approach to storytelling even further on  . Equally inspired by Creation Records, Trojan dub compilations, and Jane’s Addiction, Showalter turned to producer Nicolas Vern (The War on Drugs, Spoon) and best friend/guitarist Jason Anderson to help combine those disparate influences into a cohesive body of work. Together they achieve a loose, hedonistic vibe. With strident, sing-along style vocals and unrelenting solos, second single “Rest of It” nods toward multiple musical genres without feeling forced or dilettantish. The songs on   grapple equally with domestic issues, the near-death of his brother and, and his own impermanence, but instead of unraveling, Showalter chooses to celebrate his limited time on earth through rock and roll. The fuzzed out, synth-driven single “Radio Kids” bottles the pure teenage bliss that comes with hearing your favorite song on the FM waves, giving you a fleeting sense of courage and peace. Downtempo piano-ballad “Cry” pinpoints the devastating moment you realize that it’s you, not your partner, who are the source of the turmoil in your relationship. Frustration—with love, with family, with aging—crop up throughout the record, and Showalter speaks about them in matter-of-fact language. “You went away, you went searching” he sings at the start of the record, “You came back tired of looking.” If there were times on   where Showalter sounded lost, on  , he’s beginning to take control of his own life. Though it’s somber at times, the record is shot through with an underlying spirit of hope. Self-deprecation is replaced with honest contemplation, and whatever demons haunted   have been put to rest. —", "genre": []}

It never quite climaxes; instead, it dissolves into a sea of washed-out synthesizers. The title track speaks directly to the political and environmental disillusionment that a lot of Australians are feeling. “New heart, old blood,” Pike recites. “New arc, same flood/New money, old debt/New risk, old regret.” It scans as a reflection on the backwardness and regressiveness of the current political climate.

But his new record marks a first; the rapping on  —fluid, dynamic and above all, thoughtful—finally matches the pull and urgency of his production. In the past, a solemn chorus of horns and bass, like the one on   opener “Digging Deep,” may have outstripped the lyrical overlay. Here, though, the music provides a backdrop for Oddisee to explain the album’s premise: Our actions are only comprehensible once you understand the circumstances that have shaped our respective characters.  zeroes in on those circumstances, while serving up another selection of near-perfect beats. On the clear standout, “You Grew Up,” one verse traces the divergent paths of Oddisee and a white friend who grows up to become a murderous police officer; another examines a man whose self-loathing leads him to radical Islam. Oddisee offers a complex portrait of both men, and his storytelling is complemented by sharp lyrical asides. The producer places himself under the microscope as well: The go-go beat on “NNGE” affords him an opportunity to return to his D.C. roots, while on “Rain Dance,” he explains how his ambitions as a musician confounded his Sudanese father. The parental pressure led him to focus on his finances.

Fennelly’s rotation through these circuits connected him with Haley Fohr ( ), Janet Beveridge Bean ( ,  ), Jim Becker ( ,  ),  , Mike Weis ( ) and Cooper Crain ( ), all of whom are present here. The seven compositions on   are anchored by Fennelly’s Indian pedal harmonium and synthesizer; the harmonium, especially, is preeminent across Fennelly’s discography. The device’s distinctly droning reeds have fascinated him to the extent that he has spent nearly 12 years bending, shifting and filtering it in veneration. With  , Fennelly emerges with a sequence of pieces that interweave traditional European ceremonial forms with modern corollaries in experimental electronic and ambient directions. While opener “Restore & Slip” could be mistaken as a bagpipe-led Scottish battle hymn and “Gray Clearer” could be its consequent funeral march, Fennelly sounds positively German kosmiche on “Glossolaliac,” overlaying Becker’s fiddle and Fohr’s rhythmic murmurs on a bedrock of treated harmonium lines. Fennelly’s twined interpretations of ancient and modern disciplines have been a signature of his Mind Over Mirrors project over the course of five albums, each one gaining greater clarity and prominence than the last. He furthers this course on  , broadening his range via collaboration and reconstructing classical concepts with a modern palette of sound.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Flashes of Quincy", "artist": "Snowball ii", "description": "First things first: “Snowball” is a strange name for a band that writes music this warm (their moniker is, of course, a Simpsons reference). Throughout their third album,  , the Los Angeles outfit—primarily the vehicle of Jackson Wargo—serves up one sparkling power-pop gem after another, all of them powered by immaculate, high-stacked vocal harmonies and sterling silver guitars. Think of it as a long-delayed sequel to Teenage Fanclub’s  : big, ringing songs that mask wry, observational lyrics. Album opener “Anais & Me” is the ideal exhibit A: in each verse, Wargo speculates about the life of an invisible protagonist, filling each line with tiny, specific details (“I’ll bet you’re blowing off your curfew/puffing smokes in mists of perfume/ I’ll bet your daddy’s a fascist/ and that you piss him off in Spanish”) before gliding into the song’s gleaming-gold chorus. In “Sear ‘Em!” Wargo’s heartsick tenor floats over crashing drums and slashing guitars, a push-pull dynamic that defines much of  . The guitars stay serrated and cutting, but Wargo gingerly stacks vocal harmonies 10-stories high on top of them, like a man engaged in some perilous game of musical Jenga. The chords that drive “Resident of the United States” claw and punch, but Wargo’s voice struts up the center, spit-shined and unscathed. Mostly,   feels like a field guide to writing perfect pop songs—which is, in itself, an accomplishment. Other artists who attempt such straightforward hitmaking end up with music that’s either cloying or boring. Snowball ii prove that there’s still life in familiar formats—you just have to be driven enough to look for it. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "A Night Walking Through Mirrors", "artist": "Chicago/London Underground", "description": "Cornetist   and drummer Chad Taylor have been the sole constants in the revolving constellation of groups that have borne the name Chicago Underground going back nearly two decades, when the Chicago Underground Quartet dropped   for Delmark in 1998. Back then, the combo cleaved toward an inside-out strain of post-bop, but in the years since—in duo, trio, and quartet configurations–its music has embraced a fierce sense of freedom, even within hypnotic, circular forms. These days, Mazurek and Taylor work most often as a  , where meticulously deployed electronics usually provide a muscular skeleton for the hornman’s powerful yet lyric improvisation. In April of 2016, the Duo was performing at Café Oto in London—its first visit to the city in a decade—and for part of the stint the pair invited two powerful locals to join them. Bassist John Edwards has been a fixture on the UK improv scene for decades—he’s recently contributed some of his strongest playing to groups led by German saxophonist  —while pianist Alexander Hawkins is one of the country’s brightest young talents, already involved in strong partnerships with free improv sax legend Evan Parker and the legendary South African drummer  . Their involvement on the four extended pieces featured on   pushed the Chicago Underground out of its recent modus operandi toward a raw sort of spiritual seeking, where Mazurek’s innate melodic gifts—still deeply informed by the tart playfulness of Don Cherry—regularly collide with the thrumming energy and spacious flow of his collaborators. As usual, Taylor provides an imperturbable pulse, driving the music with unerring instincts that accommodate Edwards’ fiery arco lines and furious plucking—which on a piece like “Something Must Happen” veer toward a viscous, grinding low-end a la William Parker—and Hawkins’ hammering, skittering notes, without losing a sense of movement. He’s one of the subtlest drummers in jazz—a player possessed with faultless time who can operate in the most blustery setting without pushing his partners to the side. Mazurek is at is his best here, uncorking epic solos built from short, indelible phrases scattered across the vast landscapes of these spontaneous creations. On several pieces he adds wordless vocals, tapping into an early ‘70s spiritual jazz vibe, albeit with a much coarser, immediate energy. Only “Boss Redux” draws on some previously composed material—it features some reworked music from the Duo’s 2014 album  —but still, the foursome serves up roiling, in-the-moment energy. The album is a burner from start to finish, and a potent reminder that creative minds working together for the first time can generate something magical out of thin air if the chemistry is right.", "genre": []}

But the records also took enough liberties with that grim metal subgenre that the band seemed a prime candidate for crossover. Those departures have grown only stronger on  , the third full-length from the Little Rock, Arkansas, quartet. Throughout, Pallbearer moves even further away from easy definitions and constraining pigeonholes. Some may call it compromise; others may call it growing up. The most intriguing thing about the self-produced   is the constant tension churning within both the words and the music. Their lyrics, while still mostly bleak, now leave a little room for cautious hope (“A Plea for Understanding” even features the word “love”). And while still capable of of producing a crushing swing, the band isn’t afraid to unleash a confident, unabashed melodic sensibility; at times, Pallbearer sounds like classic Thin Lizzy, or even Boston (bassist Joseph Rowland wasn’t shy about his enjoyment of the latter in a  ). You can hear it in Brett Campbell’s agile singing, easing up into a high register free of the self-conscious “woe is me” despair of so many doom vocalists. You can hear it in guitarist Devin Holt’s mastery of both massive riffage and lovely, proggy lines that flirt with power metal.   sounds like a band finally free to be itself.

{"album": "Paradise", "artist": "ANOHNI", "description": "Plenty of artists take the notion of fighting the patriarchy as a lyrical theme, but few have zeroed in on gender in the way that ANOHNI has of late. On last year’s  , she cast the relationship between the individual and the state as that of an abusive father/child dynamic. On her new EP, the titular paradise she envisages is one where masculine authority, the unequivocal source of ecocide and injustice, has been overthrown and destroyed. On the vaporous “In My Dreams,” the realization that an unnamed figure neither loves nor wants the best for her dawns on ANOHNI while she sleeps. The song fades from earshot, but the seeds have been planted. “My father’s hand rests on my throat,” she croons on the title track, while “Enemy” picks up where  ‘s “Violent Men” left off, lamenting the condition of birthing one’s own subjugator.

But there’s an optimism here that was lacking on its unremittingly bleak predecessor. “Paradise” is frenetic and turbulent—Hudson Mohawke’s maximalist production, such a superb fit for the drama of ANOHNIi’s voice, zigs and zags like lasers here. But it also explicitly seeks to bury despair, and ANOHNI’s performance reflects it: her “ooh-ooh-ooh!” as she gears up for the song’s final climax is one of the most spontaneous, joyful ad libs of her career. Elsewhere, she derives power from naming the opposition: “You’re a mean old man,” she sneers on the distorted, vengeful “Jesus Will Kill You.” Even “Enemy” blossoms from mourning into tense but glorious chorales. The political agenda ANOHNI began on   took explicit aim at the neoliberal, drone-bombing Obama administration, but her themes feel more relevant than ever now. The urgency of her resistance is encapsulated in “Ricochet,” ostensibly a weary, pleading cry against possible reincarnation. But beneath the fist she shakes at God is an acceptance of the here and now, the need to be fully present in order to fight. Utopia doesn’t come easily for ANOHNI on  , but simply imagining the possibility is the first step towards it. —", "genre": []}

A dream-pop documentation of death, embarrassment, grief, and anxiety, the album pairs sharp, searching lyrical observations with purposefully spare instrumentation. On the hushed, acoustic, “Nothing Melodious,” MacNeil sings about a relationship that is breaking down. The song is clear-eyed in its approach: MacNeil seems to take the blame for lapses in communication, while also calling out her lovers’ failure to understand her. Other tracks—like “Wake Him” and “I Know You Can Hear It”—rely more on metaphor, using third-person perspective and biblical characters as fronts for MacNeil’s vulnerability. Sonically, the album is the perfect complement to MacNeil’s naked self-expression. It’s remarkably sparse, MacNeil’s voice mixed far up front. She and producer John Vanderslice opted to leave any mistakes during the recording process intact, giving the album an authentic, imperfect feel. The recordings may lack polish, but they have a strong sense of emotional immediacy. “Wake Him” relies mainly on MacNeil’s vocals and organ, which are only occasionally joined by percussion and horns. “Tie Me To The Ground” is a piano ballad, through which float gentle choir vocals.

Langhorne regularly worked as a studio guitarist from the 1960s onward with such artists as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, and also was involved in creating a series of film soundtracks. One such soundtrack, to Peter Fonda’s 1971 Old West-set film  , was  ; Langhorne’s hauntingly beautiful, home-recorded combination of instruments like banjo, fiddle and dulcimer felt like a recovered performance from before the era of recorded sound. For the tribute, whose proceeds will largely go to Langhorne and his family as he receives hospice care following years of poor health, Scissor Tail’s brief to participating artists was to interpret a song from that soundtrack however they chose. It’s a murderers’ row of talent old and new—Lee Ranaldo, Susan Alcorn, Chris Corsano, Scott Tuma, Chuck Johnson, Steve Gunn and Tom Carter are just some of the participants, and there’s even an appropriate ringer via John Fahey’s “Red Cross, Disciple of Christ Today.” Byron Coley’s liner notes provide a portrait of Langhorne’s creative and musical life, and the overall result is a truly heartfelt salute. —", "genre": []}
{"album": "Please Let Me Know", "artist": "So Stressed", "description": "One of the larger tensions that exists between artists and critics is the latter’s insistence on taking the work of the former to be strict autobiography, but the pain that courses through the third album from Sacramento’s So Stressed feels too immediate and too visceral to be a work of fiction. Its 10 songs seem to document a grueling breakup, but what makes the record so rattling is that all of the resulting agony is focused inward. Where 2015’s   was stacked with bruising hardcore,  is both paradoxically more measured and more tortured. Opener “Fur Sale” sails out on a sleek sheet of melodic guitars, and frontman Morgan Fox isn’t screaming but singing. But about two minutes in, the turbulence hits: “Nothing compares to you,” Fox sings, “But I still compare everything to you.” From there it’s a quick dive into dissonance; the guitars turn pitch black and Morgan doubles over howling. The rest of the record volleys between those two poles, post-hardcore melodicism trading off with proper-hardcore panic attacks. “Majestic Face” manages both at once, eerie vocal harmonies gliding across heart-attack double-bass drumming. In “Old Hiss,” Fox runs into his old flame in public, which sends him into a spiral of despair: “We’ll grow old together,” he wails as the band pitches and rolls behind him, “Right up until I wake up.” Even when the band stretches out musically, the results are shot through with unease. The sparse “Peach,” is built on a skeletal strum and lit up with squiggles of synthesizer that sound like an MRI machine melting down. And while the band’s ventures into melodicism demonstrate impressive breadth, it’s the full-throated ragers that land the hardest. The panicked “Subsequent Rips” opens with Fox declaring “I write myself a heartfelt love letter/ and read it into the mirror,” against chaotic corkscrews of guitar; both elements are operating in their own time signature: Fox plows forward regardless of meter; the band hammers away chaotically, like they’re falling down a flight of stairs.   trepans down into the center of heartbreak and records all of the mayhem it finds there. It may not be autobiography, but that doesn’t make it feel any less real. —", "genre": []}

{"album": "Meet You", "artist": "Century Palm", "description": "Toronto’s  could have only been born in a blistering Canadian winter. Dark, taut, icy and slick, their debut album   is a crash course in post-punk—there’s some Krautrock influence, like the Neue Deutsche Welle bands, plus hints of goth. They adopt the angular guitars of Wire and The Fall, the deep emotionality of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, and even the pop sensibility of Devo and The B-52’s, while maintaining a distinct identity of their own. Simply put, Century Palm have crafted an irony-free study of ’80s independent rock that is simultaneously fresh and immediately nostalgic. After a few opening tracks set the shadowy stage,   starts to take shape with “Then You’re Gone,” a breakneck tune that frenetically builds upon itself thanks to a rhythm section as tight as piano wire, spiraling upwards and falling back down again with expert precision. A manic keyboard line is scribbled over the top, giving the track an even more frantic and rattled dimension. In addition to the sound and structure of the songs themselves, frontman Andrew Payne runs the gamut of brooding punk vocal styles, perhaps unintentionally, yet charismatically, nailing many key reference points: at times he echoes Ian Curtis’ booming bass, or Howard Devoto’s blasé snarl. “Walk Forever Blind,” another highlight, kicks off with heavy synths droning into space, until the drum beat lumbers into the mix and Payne delivers the line: “I’ll walk forever blind/ Over the hills of time/ It is the only way,” like a man who has finally discovered the meaning of life, but is too depressed to let us in on the secret. It’s not that   is a direct homage to or pastiche of any of these bands; its connect-the-dots approach in such an expressive and expansive genre is part of what makes it a joy to listen to.

On their debut full-length album,  , Hiccup plow through a collection of 12 wonderful originals that touch on pop-punk, girl group doo-wop, ‘90s grunge revivalism and nuanced surf rock with a lineup rounded out by drummer Piyal Basu.

{"album": "Overseas V", "artist": "Eivind Opsvik", "description": "On the fifth album by his long-running band Overseas, bassist  —a native of Norway who’s been living in New York for two decades now—tightens up his group’s attack, putting a sly emphasis on groove and demanding concision from his band of top-flight improvisers. In fact, even tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby—one of the most loquacious soloists in jazz—reels it in, frequently adding to the rhythmic fabric as much as he elucidates melody. Although Overseas is most certainly a modern jazz combo, the way the record was mixed and the arrangements often suggest a more rock-oriented sound—the tautness of ‘70s post-punk. In press materials for the record the bassist says, “My music doesn’t really sound like Talking Heads or the B-52s, but I listened to a lot of that on the road lately, so the sound and sensibility seeped into my writing.” Indeed, from the opening bars of “I’m Up on This Step,” a slithering, funky marvel of polymetric precision, the groove is shaped by a number of overlapping patterns: a jagged guitar line by  , a stuttering beat from Kenny Wollesen, interlocked, cascading figures by Malaby and keyboardist Jacob Sacks, and the leader’s pumping pizzicato bass. As the tune hits full steam, it seems to unravel into abstraction, with all of the instruments engaging in a feather-light dance as they slowly disengage. “Extraterrestrial Tantrum” percolates inside an ambient glow, opening with rudimentary drum machine, elegant piano chords, and texture-rich guitar and saxophone tones that coalesce into one lovely cloud of sound, while Opsvik offers plaintive arco sobs, drifting into the din. “Brraps!” deploys a heavy funk vibe, with Seabrook channeling Nile Rodgers while the leader virtually sings with his bow; Malaby and Opsvik eventually trade 12-bar solos, demonstrating the lean efficiency at work throughout. “First Challenge on the Road” shows how the group can do a lot with a little, as the bulk of its substance is a repetitive, motorik coda where the guitarist subtly unleashes a constantly shifting series of galloping chords. The energy and timbre of the music could produce clumsy fusion in the wrong hands, but this band masterfully balances power and subtlety, highlighting its time-tested rapport by shaving away all that’s extraneous.", "genre": []}
{"album": "Rays", "artist": "Rays", "description": "The way Rays’ debut kicks off, with the warbling, mutated jangle of “Attic,” is a perfect scene-setter. It recalls some of the key themes of early post-punk; if punk stripped away all the fuss and pomp of ‘70s rock to its bare essentials and set it at warp speed, post-punk bands drilled further down into the dark core of psychedelia, to all the bad drugs and isolating cults beneath the swirling colors. “Attic” is rickety in that same way, with a woozy synth line and Eva Hannan’s spiraling vocals taking us up there. It brings back the childhood dread of seeing that unstable little ladder pop down from the ceiling at a relative’s house:  This is the territory that Rays explore—though you shouldn’t expect any of those secrets to be made explicit over the course of these 11 songs. Where punk can be didactic, post-punk works best with lyrical bones, letting the listeners, like forensic specialists, follow the story back themselves through clues that might not seem obvious at first. Rays, of course, know punk and post-punk so intimately these tropes are second nature to them: Hannan, Stanley Martinez, Alexa Pantalone and Troy Hewitt have been/are in more excellent bands than one can count (Pang, The World,  , Life Stinks, and so forth), and they genuinely sound like they’re having a good time with one another here. That’s especially evident when they’re working with the existential dread of everyday life, as on “Attic”; other tracks in that vein, like “Drop Dead” and “Pain and Sorrow,” sound positively ebullient in much the manner of the best Fall songs, curdled with wicked delight. Master engineer Mikey Young (of  ,  , etc.) brings this quality out perfectly; the album sounds, essentially, like a well-recorded live performance, rather than an airless studio artifact. Rays’ debut is, thus, a very good document of a very good band, and its restraint is part of what makes it special. This isn’t a band that could come out of the gate hard; these songs work so well because they hang together so laconically, belying the tension beneath. If they went full bore, they’d fall apart.

But these songs are so exuberant, and Charles’ voice is so defiant and confident, that it hardly registers that way. Charles’ 2010 EP   demonstrated that the Edmonton singer wasn’t content to stay within the parameters of retro soul—the G-funk-influenced “Parkdale,” in particular, demonstrated her eagerness to cover fresh ground—and  continues that imaginative streak, yet often in subtler ways. Charles constructed these songs with a series of producers, including the Drake collaborator Slakah the Beatchild, and as a result  presents itself as a grab-bag of surprises. The short “Intro,” with its modulated voices and effects, provides a thrilling launch pad into the thumping title track, while “Two Steps” leans on an unexpected and glimmering Afrobeat guitar riff. Both “Endless Chain” and “Money” evoke vintage Muscle Shoals recordings, but with an emphasis on precise and booming percussion that keeps them fresh and modern. These varied styles give Charles different contexts to experiment with her vocal gymnastics. Throughout the album, she pays homage to legends like Aretha Franklin and Etta James—on “Sweet Memories,” she does an uncanny take on the Jackson 5’s shrill howls—but she’s got a sense of spunk that’s all her own.

There are a number of tunes here that Haggard didn’t write—Blaze Foley’s “If I Could Only Fly” or the Jimmie Davis classic “Nobody’s Darlin’ But Mine” (the title is simplified to “Nobody’s Darling” on  )—but they help fill in a portrait that Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy paints, indicating the breadth and poetic sensibility of the country great. He leads a fantastic band, roomy enough to touch on Haggard’s broad curiosity as a true purveyor of Americana—a guy who made records paying tribute to the music of Western swing-heavy Bob Wills and Texas troubadour Jimmie Rodgers—including airy saxophone and flute lines prominently featured in the arrangements. Guest guitarist A.J. Roach beautifully takes the lead on “The Day the Rains Came” and flutist Nuala Kennedy offers tender contributions to “Some of Us Fly.” The arrangements reach toward a cosmic strain of honky-tonk with a loose, swinging rhythmic feel shaped by drummer Van Campbell and bassist Danny Kiely that feels warmly lived-in, allowing the band enough space to chime in with instrumental asides—particularly from fiddler Cheyenne Mize and fellow guitarist Chris Rodahaffer. It’s hard not to sense the affinity Oldham felt for Haggard, a guy who bent the rules of Nashville to suit his own quirks for more than five decades. But ultimately, it’s the songs themselves and the singular soul Haggard imparted to them that provides the inspiration for this homage, an effort that celebrates its subject through Oldham’s stubborn originality. On the surface it might seem like a strange entry into Haggard’s genius, but once the observer digs a bit deeper, Oldham emerges as the perfect guide.", "genre": ["Country", "Americana"]}

These are images that could come to mind when listening to  , the dramatic new EP from British trio  , whose music blends jazz, cosmic funk, and tribal dance into a thick fluid. Led by saxophonist  , drummer  , and synth player Dan Leavers, the band exudes an intergalactic tone that lands somewhere in outer space, akin to psych-jazz visionaries   and Pharoah Sanders. But while those pioneers envisioned space travel as a relaxing trip to nirvana, there’s a stark sense of urgency to The Comet is Coming, a feeling that the end is near and there’s no escaping the despair.  feels shaded by recent world events, although the music doesn’t address them directly. In an era of “fake news” and mounting political tension, there’s a dark fog looming above these songs, even if the rhythms are fairly upbeat. While the group’s   mixed psych-rock and hip-hop with slightly brighter results,   is overtly jazz and techno, equally suited for nightclubs and low budget sci-fi movies. On “Final Eclipse,” in particular, the crew assembles a steady 4/4 beat that grows more turbulent as it unfolds. Near the four-minute mark, Hallett and Hutchings inject squealing horns and gushing drums into the mix, pushing the song to its euphoric peak. It’s not only the EP’s best song, it best epitomizes the record’s disparate ambience: the existential dread and the joy of surrender. The EP conceives of death the same as Flying Lotus’ 2014 LP,  , which also viewed extinction as a bright journey to the afterlife. “We see death as the first stage of rebirth,” goes a line from The Comet’s  . “A chance for new ideas, sounds and ways of interacting to grow.” In a way then,   isn’t just about literal destruction; it conceptualizes life after the apocalypse, when the world we’ve known is gone, and it’s time to create new political, social, and economic structures.

Loose Tooth is one of the shining lights of that stylistically diverse Philly scene, and their sophomore LP,  , makes the case for them being at the head of the pack.  is a hard record to nail down: its sunny, Pavement-esque side—underscored by Kian Sorouri’s half-spoken, half melodically shouted vocals—is effectively countered by post-punk chugging and some genuinely dark turns (see the death-centric “Day Old Glory” and the tense “Little Blue”). That slipperiness is really what keeps Loose Tooth from feeling like ’90s revivalists, and it’s also what drives and elevates the whole record. There’s a fascinating tension here between the band’s titular looseness and and straight-up headbanging passages: Songs like “Free Skate” and “Roach Motel” open like free jazz, unfurling as soon as they’re born, and then—just before dissolution—find a powerful groove to get stuck in. Lyrically, too, Loose Tooth is comfortable being both earnest and playful. If anything, that’s the mission statement outlined on opener “Sleep With The State Concept,” where Sorouri sings, “This is how it goes with matters of great importance / I forget, and go out for a ride.” All of this swinging can cause a little motion sickness, which feels both fully appropriate for the times and like a natural progression from the tidier stylistic about-faces on Loose Tooth’s previous LP,  .   is the sound of a band growing into itself, and having a lot of fun doing it. That Philly scene, still in the midst of one hell of a growth spurt of its own, is looking more formidable every day. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "Pop Punk", "indie rock"]}

Their minimal instrumentation—just a guitar and bass—emphasized vulnerability, bolstering the impact of their interlocking voices. On  they’ve subtly shifted gears, opting for songs that are alternately calm and cutting. Sonically, Tucker and Tividad are still experimenting. They introduce drums on this album, but the transition isn’t jarring. Drummer Miles Wintner is a patient, measured player, who allows them to harvest elements of ’90s rock they couldn’t have explored without a backbeat. His serene rhythms smooth out slowcore jaunts like “Sleepless” and “Your Heart,” which adopt leisurely tempos and a lethargic cadence. Girlpool makes sharp turns into noise-rock on tracks like “Corner Store,” where a jangly, sanguine melody suddenly gives way to messy distortion. Other times, the duo gleefully employs swirling guitars (“She Goes By”), bass flourishes (“High Rise”), and bright, plinking piano chords (“Powerplant”). Lyrically,   often nods to adolescence—the narrator of one song holds a jar of change, makes a mess on a kitchen counter, and carries crumbs in her pocket—but it gradually twists into bleaker terrain, offering grimy visions of industrial America. They consider lost innocence on “Soup,” an eerie, slow-moving song about a teenage addict; they make quips about climate change on the dream-pop slow burn “It Gets More Blue.” Later, they’re tackling much bigger fish: On “Static Somewhere,” they weave together wry metaphors about losing yourself in modern vices; the title track grapples with the inevitability of a drone-powered future. The album ends with optimistic longing to find a way out of the mindless landscape: “I hope I’ll find you / Static somewhere.” It’s Tucker and Tividad’s quiet refusal to shy away from darkness that allows them to persevere through the noise. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}

Rhythm and lyricism prove equal forces in Shaw’s transfixing “Its Motion Keeps,” where circling bowed strings and plucky pizzicato accompany the syncopated chant, “my days, my weeks, my months, my years.” The unraveling rounds dissolve into moments of ecstatic, glowing glissando and sustained atonal harmonies. In Vrebalov’s “Bubbles,” a line from a poem written by Robert Creeley and John Cage—“Then what is emptiness for”—is voiced by a lone soprano, between moments of animalistic cacophony and urgent chanting. The noise soon gives way to resonant bells and a glistening chorus. The album closes with Parry’s brazen anthem “Their Passing in Time,” which, in the beginning, trembles with solemn minor-key sopranos singing, “With the passing of time …” At first, the line is delivered in solo; then two, then several voices, framed in “ah-ah-ahhhhs,” droning hums and dirge-like strings, join in just past the halfway mark.

One Communist leader condemned  , the “youth music” that thrived around 1965-75, as being part of a broader wartime “cultural pacification process.” Compiler/producer Jan Hagenkötter has rounded up some of the strongest tracks from this era, many of which play out like mini histories in global music. Duy Quang & Thái Hiền’s “Mộng Về Quê” (“Dream Come Home”), contains elements of French chanson, a gnarly surf-guitar solo, wheezing Farfisa organ, jazzy saxophone, Latin percussion, and pentatonic melody.

{"album": "Ultramega OK", "artist": "Soundgarden", "description": "Like every Seattle band who became superstars when grunge broke into the mainstream, Soundgarden began as something much smaller and stranger. Before the major labels caught on and launched them to multiplatinum success, they were signed to Sub Pop, and then to Greg Ginn’s SST Records for debut full-length  . Even on that punk-driven indie label, Soundgarden was a square peg. Guitarist Kim Thayil had become an Iommi-worshiping conjurer of detuned, sludgy blues—punk in ethos, but far more of a metalhead in style. Thayil gave the band a sonic backbone that bridged the metal ’80s with the impending alt-rock boom of the ’90s. But the weapon that made them a mainstream force was singer Chris Cornell, who tragically passed away last week. The many tributes to Cornell that have been written since his passing have rightly focused on his massive range and masterful control of his vocal instrument.  presents him as a much rawer presence than the generational talent who stalks the songs on  and   But it also shows limitless promise, like a rookie who can’t defend the pick-and-roll yet but can dunk from the foul line. The ecstatic joy of Cornell’s voice breathes pulsing, wriggling life into the album. His lyrics sometimes skew dark, as on the jaundiced love song “Head Injury,” but they’re written from a perspective far more inscrutable than the bleak autobiography of later songs like “Outshined” and “Fell on Black Days.” The Cornell-penned “Beyond the Wheel” is the best song on the record, and it’s a stone-cold Soundgarden classic. Cornell starts the song in a low, rumbling baritone, but ratchets his register up to a Rob Halford-like falsetto, doing battle with Thayil’s jagged guitar. A crisp new Jack Endino-helmed mix—the way the album was always meant to sound, according to the band—makes the song’s impact even stronger. “We’re driving flesh and blood / Deep into the ground,” Cornell howls at the song’s climax, and those lines induce chills every time. Cornell would go on to be one of the best singers in rock history, but the primal yawp of “Beyond the Wheel” remains a major high point — gloriously unhinged, and brimming with the possibility of what was to come. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "Rock"]}

DJ Format winkingly acknowledged this revivalist spirit in the title of his 2003 album,  which included “Culinary” alongside two other songs with Abdominal that celebrated the hip-hop sound of ’88. That fire remains intact on   and, when you’re a rapper in your 40s, that’s no small feat. Abdominal’s Kane-meets-Serch flow and lacerating agility are on full display. He still nails traditional underground rap targets: sanitized, overprocessed culture (“Dirt”), his need to be respectful of hip-hop as an outsider (“White Rapper”), and the day-to-day schlep of working as a touring musician (“Behind the Scenes”). He delivers all of these with a knowing, aw-hell charisma and a flow that clicks masterfully with Format’s distinctly Golden Age production.

When the two players combine their talents, the results are an engrossing combination of centuries-old balladeering, pre-war music, and contemporary experimental sounds. True to old-time form, House and Land’s songs revel in spooky darkness, driven by ghostly, off-kilter notes that raise the hair on the back of your neck. Morgan’s fiddle creaks and moans, while Henson’s hyper-detailed guitar playing alternates among airy flits, glistening cascades, and blooming billows. Henson and Morgan trade off lead vocal duties, and they harmonize so closely at times, as on the unaccompanied “Johnny,” that their two voices almost sound like one. When Henson sings of the hour of death drawing near and laying garments down, “So time will soon disrobe us all / Of what we now possess,” she sounds as though she’s personally heralding the end of days; her high, fearless delivery makes you inclined to believe her. But the duo splits from tradition with its addition of shruti box drones, as well as with light touches of percussion from Asheville drummer Thom Nguyen. On “Feather Dove” and “The Day Is Past and Gone,” his soft rumblings and cymbal splashes recall a distant but fierce summer storm, while his clatters in the background of “Unquiet Grave” are a chilling, chaotic foil to the song’s pointed lyrics about pining for a dead lover. House and Land is an exercise in marrying bygone days with the present—Henson and Morgan assuredly honor the past—but for them, tradition isn’t so much an anchor as it is a springboard toward bold new ideas.", "genre": ["Folk", "Americana"]}

Svartsyn’s latest,  , is even better, thanks in large part to the ongoing contribution of Belgium drummer Hammerman. Hammerman’s main project is the death metal band Fractured Insanity, where his work is solid but not especially distinctive within the subgenre’s conventions. Svartsyn’s looser, blackened structure gives him a chance to stretch his tentacles. His sound is surprisingly crisp, and dare we say it, ferally swinging. “The White Mask” opens with throbbing feedback pulse until Hammerman comes in with an itchy, solid beat, anchoring shifting grooves in the bleak murk. On “Dark Prophet,” he alternates blast beats with precise, dry, almost syncopated thwacks. Set against Osnias’s buzzing, shoegaze-performed-with-a-metal-file riffs, the effect is gorgeously disorienting, like Beelzebub fronting Sonic Youth. “Black Thrones of Death” is even more adventurous. It starts with a few slow thuds and then Hammerman lets it rip, with the drums thundering at almost blast-beat speed, but with rolls, pick-ups, and patterns that are positively  .

{"album": "Gently Among the Coals", "artist": "Threefifty", "description": "The New York-based collective known as Threefifty is like a rolling snowball that gathers everything in its path. Founders Brett Parnell and Geremy Schulick met while studying guitar at the Yale School of Music and released two albums of spare instrumentals, interpreting Bach and Scarlatti on the former and playing their own compositions on the latter. Since then, Threefifty has gradually grown into something resembling a rock band, as they added new members (including their multi-instrumentalist wives) and expanded their sound from classical to folk, bluegrass, and the post-rock of groups like Rachel’s and Mogwai. That “post-” prefix has dogged them for a few years now, and on their latest album,   Threefifty have done little to dispel the label. Opener “Crossing State Lines” and “Andromeda” feature pointillist guitar notes that arrange themselves into melodic constellations, the band churning up a dramatic din behind them. Acoustic instruments, mainly mandolin and fiddle, mingle with electric guitars, picked and strummed to add a folksy flavor to the “The Door” and “You Are Going the Right Way.” To that framework, they add unexpected flourishes: L.A. electronic musician Daedelus undergirds “More” with jagged rhythms, which spar violently with Parnell and Schulick’s guitars—it doesn’t evoke a jam session as much as a knife fight. “Running in a Burning House” is a showcase for New York multi-instrumentalist Nathan Koci, whose deployment of whistling and trumpet call to mind the gunslinger soundtracks of Ennio Morricone. Post-rock tends toward the deconstructive, but Threefifty emphasize the opposite: building a unique sound out of various fragments and traditions they come across. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "post-rock"]}

Through a fog of phasing organ chords and skittering drum loops, Halo unravels the precarious mechanics of consciousness de Campos explores. The lyrical centerpiece (“Where does this grinding grind? Where does this gear engage?”) becomes something of a mantra, establishing a thematic tone that carries through the entire album. It wouldn’t be difficult to fill a page in admiration of Halo’s lyrical prowess. On “Jelly,” the album’s first single, her descriptions of detached emotions and reactive judgement within a relationship crisis are harrowing. Throughout  , Halo finesses modern conditions into classical poetic forms and sets a lyrical standard seldom seen in the liners of an experimental electronic record. Though she has vacillated between instrumental and lyrically-driven work over the past six years, on  , she delivers the most openly narrative work of her career. In a sense, that makes   Halo’s most accessible recording. Though the poetic language of the album is strikingly direct, Halo’s compositions sprawl wildly, corralling stormy free jazz passages (“Arschkriecher”) and airy dubstep ballads (“Like an L” and “Syzygy”) with jungly El Guincho-esque body music (“Moontalk”).

Left to his own (analog) devices here, Tran treats   as a blank canvas for psychedelic sound art paintings and manic New Age music.

{"album": "arry Grenadie", "artist": "Jack DeJohnette", "description": "The members of the jazz supergroup Hudson share a language created in cities: by dense hive-minds of musicians, the spaces where they cross-pollinate, and audiences who amplify the buzz. But as with many people who grow older, the four members of the group eventually moved out of town—in this case, up the Hudson River north of New York City. That happy accident of mutual proximity, and master drummer Jack DeJohnette’s 75th birthday, spurred this new project, which also features John Medeski (keyboard instruments), Larry Grenadier (bass) and John Scofield (guitar). They form a multi-generational crew of improvisers, particularly noted for working at the nexus of jazz, funk, and rock. (See: Medeski Martin and Wood, or Miles Davis c. 1969, or the bulk of Scofield’s discography.) Yet their first album isn’t an overt fusion of a style x + style y. Their mergers are more subtle, gestures from musicians who have lived through a lot, and who now freely supplement their common dialect at their own leisure and discretion. About half of   is original compositions, with the remainder written by folk and rock musicians connected to their home region: Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Jimi Hendrix, and Levon Helm of The Band. The latter portion is read with a deceptive cleanliness, with Scofield clearly stating melody lines; at times, Hudson comes close to being a rather overqualified instrumental cover band. Sensing as much, the quartet attempts to match its musical choices with the lyrics of the originals—see the messy apocalyptic breakdown on “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” or the unsettled wistfulness in “Woodstock.” DeJohnette takes the vocal mic on the New Orleans-inspired mixed-meter shuffle “Dirty Ground”; his “Song For World Forgiveness” transforms into a rock ballad. The band sounds more conventional on the hard-bop blues throwdown “Tony Then Jack,” or on the Spanish-tinged churn of “El Swing.” All this makes their opener a red herring, as the collective, groove-driven improvisation “Hudson” suggests this meeting of minds might be a loud, high-intensity jam band. But by their closer, “Great Spirit Peace Chant”—literally a group chant, inspired by the native inhabitants of the Hudson Valley—it’s the range of what they attempt which echoes loudest. —", "genre": ["Jazz"]}

Take the hook on “Unstuck” as an example: “Rolled the dice / Fucked around and lost your life / Double or nothing? / It’s only right.” Woods rhymes as though life is the opening scene of   and he’s   to Jimmy McNulty. This is the war Prodigy  . On  , woods presents terror as a common occurrence in places where it’s not supposed to happen. “Entourage exchanging rounds in your gentrified downtown,” he quips on “Superpredator,” a Kool G Rap-influenced track with a kill-or-be-killed aesthetic. There is carnage on this record. The hooks express consequence: death is not a cold-blooded aberration, it’s the daily forecast. Produced entirely by Blockhead,   is a sobering record, which isn’t surprising given much of woods’s catalogue. And yet, even in its bleakest moments, there’s a concerted effort to be playful on tracks like “Police Came To My Show,” “Groundhogs Day,” and the intro to “Fall Back,” where woods laments his second-class status in a woman’s heart. “Police Came To My Show” dials into a “ ” levity, subverting the anti-blue stance in rap: the cops pay the cover price to get in, stay for a while, and dip before his last verse.

His voice was like some Dylan phase that never quite came to pass, and he wrote songs that could fold into one’s life with ease, as if they’d always just been there. Nau was actually a veteran songwriter by the time of  ’s release—he fronted the playful and complex Page France and the more melancholy and rootsy Cotton Jones—but on his first outing under his own name, he stripped away the showier aspects of his writing and presented a startlingly pure, straightforward vision. The songs on  had more in common with jazz standards than most of the music being written by Nau’s contemporaries. All of which creates significant pressure for Nau’s follow-up,  . When you’ve stripped your songs down to their sweet and slightly psychedelic essence, where do you go from there? Nau’s answer to this question is to broaden his sound while using his lyrics to reflect on the notion of change.   successfully expands the sonic palette of   without sacrificing its predecessor’s soulful feel. It starts out familiar enough: Opener “Good Thing” is a groovy meditation on nature and pleasure elevated to the realm of the spiritual by some “Chariots of Fire”-esque piano chords; “I Root” is an endearing, big-picture love song that recalls Harry Nilsson’s “Everybody’s Talkin.” But later, Nau brings in a few less-expected elements, like the distorted breakbeat on the instantly-hummable “How You’re So For Real,” the queasy vocal filter on “Scatter,” and the sweaty blues guitar licks and skronky saxophone freakouts of “The Load.” The record journeys from the expected into the mysterious, but Nau is a trustworthy guide who brings melody and humanity to every track. Smooth and stoney singer-songwriter dudes abound in the 2010s, and it takes a lot to stand out in a canon that often feels as if it were built for blending in. In Nau’s case, the difference is in the songwriting. His songs bear new fruit on each repeated listen: Sometimes it’s a half-buried counter-melody, sometimes it’s in a subtle turn of phrase. This is generous, full-hearted music.

But you never know exactly how you’re going to get it. It could appear as brightly-polished pop, downbeat acoustic folk, fuzzy guitar jamming, or disjointed lo-fi collage. Whatever mode Donovan enters, he rarely stays there for long. On Donovan’s second Peacers album,  , we get all of the above and more. On their 2015 self-titled debut, the Peacers were a duo with Donovan and   label mate Ty Segall, but now the group is a four-piece including Fresh & Onlys bassist Shayde Sartin (Segall is no longer involved). Expanding the lineup seems to have freed Donovan to explore his wide musical toolbox even further, resulting in the most sonically diverse effort of his career. It’s odd to say this about such patient, measured music, but in many ways   is a 17-track roller coaster. The thrill is in the juxtapositions. Donovan loves to swerve from one tone to its opposite, stringing together songs that sound pretty similar but feel totally different. He’ll swing from the classic-sounding “D.T.M.T.Y.C.Y.M.,” which could pass for a Big Star outtake, to the reddened guitar squall of “Robot Flame,” then dip down into “Windy Car,” an acoustic-heavy ballad so subdued it sounds like Low playing around a campfire. The most carefully crafted gem on  , the swaying “Theme From Sonny,” feels lifted from a ‘60s folk-pop compilation—which, of course, means Donovan follows with the shambling guitar of a distorted one-minute ditty called “On Matt.” Many bands would kill to come up with just one song as catchy as “Theme From Sonny,” but for Donovan, no single tune is an end in itself. The best way to listen to   is to think of each track as another stepping stone toward Donovan’s weird vision of musical nirvana, a place where any sound goes but it all sounds good. —", "genre": ["Rock"]}
{"album": "Puff", "artist": "Bernice", "description": "Upon hearing “St. Lucia,” the first song on Bernice’s five-track EP  , you’ll find yourself in a deep, hypnotic groove. The feeling continues on the next track, “Don’t Wanna Be European,” sympathizing with lead vocalist Robin Dann as she debunks appropriation. But then the EP gets dark, and for those of us who’ve gone through some rough, depressive moments, it all hits close to home on the track “David.” Here, Dunn muses: “Answering the phone / Closing the door / Everything feels awfully empty for David.” Hearing those words set to pausing tones brings a sense calm and hurt; the singer begs for someone,  , to “just give him something to believe in.” After so many listens, one doesn’t feel sad, but rather hopeful that someone close to David can help him find a way through the abyss. Things turn around on the fast-moving “Talking About Her,” and mellow out on the final “Gemini.” Of all the songs, “David” feels most striking for its humanity, while “Talking About Her” and “St. Lucia” give a taste of what the band is best capable of—funk-driven instrumentals, dreamy falsettos, and catchy lyrics. The ups and downs that flow through each track give   an even pace, and, if this record indicates what’s coming next, Bernice will offer great pop, R&B, and electronic music for a long time. This is a captivating listen, a record that will put you at ease over and over again. —", "genre": ["Pop", "R&B"]}
{"album": "The Boy Who Spoke to the Wind", "artist": "Lando Chill", "description": "Forty-plus years into its history, hip-hop has seen no shortage of producers and MCs who march to their own beat, so to speak. Today, we can point to new or recent albums by envelope-pushing artists like  ,  ,  ,  , and others as hallmarks of a creative climate that’s rife with out-of-the-box thinking. And with hip-hop’s international reach more prevalent than ever, the genre’s capacity to absorb outside influences appears limitless. It says a lot, then, that Lando Chill’s third full-length,  , sounds as inventive as it does. Where Chill’s previous two full-lengths and EP hewed closer to your typical soul-rap fusion, the new album immediately announces itself as the most richly varied work of the Tucson-based rapper/poet’s career to date. This time, Chill and returning producer/multi-instrumentalist Lasso take a quantum leap forward, arguably bringing the alternative hip-hop paradigm along for the ride. This is all the more remarkable considering that Chill, whose real name is Lance Washington, didn’t grow up as an especially avid fan of rap music. Instead, he had a much deeper affinity for jazz and classical, which shows in his emphasis on timbre, as well as in the way he frequently foregoes beats for free-form atmospheres. A haunting piano loop, for example, anchors “o sicario e o padre” (Portuguese for “the hit man and the priest”). The song does contain a rather stock, minimal hip-hop beat, but the piano, which is fragmented and heavily smeared in reverb, lands the music closer to the moody stillness of, say, the electronic duo Lamb than to Chill’s alt-rap contemporaries. A less imaginative artist more focused on keeping up with trends might have thrown in some trap elements, but Chill and Benbi, the track’s producer, clearly weren’t interested in taking the easy way out. Instead, they let the beat drop out in the song’s ambient-leaning middle section, where Lando trades in his rapid-fire flow for a more melodic delivery that’s treated with effects for a touch of surrealism. As spare as it gets, “o sicario” is a gripping, utterly sumptuous piece of music—just one of several in a sprawling track sequence that unfolds more like a suite than a grouping of 15 disparate tracks. Much like on Joni Mitchell’s 1975 landmark  , jazz functions as a departure point on  , so that the music is no longer quite recognizable as jazz. The album also strains against the limits of hip-hop. Dense and challenging,   doesn’t digest easily in one sitting, at least not at first. But Lando Chill and company reward their listeners and fellow artists alike—not to mention rap music as a whole—for the patience their new music demands.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "underground hip hop"]}

After moving to Chicago in 2000, Elkington took up with  ’s Douglas McCombs as a permanent member of   and Janet Beveridge Bean ( ,  ) to form  , all the while maintaining the simmer on his primary group, The Zincs. Through these projects, Elkington became a go-to collaborator for many Chicago musicians and carved out a personal range of styles that land somewhere in the gray between traditional English folk, scrappy Midwestern indie rock, and Chicago post-rock. The latter fastened him to the city’s improvised music scene in the early years of the 21st century and served as a powerful opportunity to rub elbows with a network of composers from both classical and less formal vernaculars. As   proves, this constant musical conversation matured Elkington—not only as a fingerstylist of tremendous prowess, but also as a bright and cogent arranger. Though the tender folk incantations of   may seem like a return to his Anglo roots, Elkington revisits these sites with new eyes. Gentle traces of Nic Jones and   are deeply embedded in his style here, but the roguish writhings of   and Nick Cave are equally as present. Recorded at Wilco’s homebase The Loft, Elkington punches his guitar and voice up into the forefront and embellishes these prime movers with elegant string arrangements—cello, pedal steel, violin, and upright bass. Sessions with The Loft engineer Mark Greenberg yield a remarkable series of recordings—Elkington’s six-string boasts a vivid clarity, Nick Macri’s upright bass is full of warmth, and Tomeka Reid’s cello solo on “Wading the Vapors” roils like a storm under Elkington’s patient arpeggiations. Along with this deft arsenal of players, Elkington helps to breathe new life into a variety of beloved folk traditions in a refreshingly candid manner.", "genre": ["Folk", "experimental folk", "traditional"]}
{"album": "Big Skies", "artist": "Mere Women", "description": "The baleful, atmospheric post-punk of Sydney quartet Mere Women is more desolate and cavernous than ever on their third album,  . Recorded with Tim Carr, who has produced all three Mere Women albums,  is full of icicle guitars and heaving bass, and lyrics that deepen the group’s longstanding fixation on alienation and dislocation. “Nothing feels as good as it used to,” sings keyboardist/vocalist Amy Wilson on “Numb.” “Nothing fills the void like you do.” Appropriately, the group’s bleak, anxious songs are swallowed by a churning undercurrent of noise. The stormy sonics mirror Wilson’s nagging doubts: “Who will take care of me?” she asks on “Is This Real,” a line that echoes the concerns of their 2014 single “Your Street” (“Will you still want me when I’m old and frail?”). The songs on   put a greater focus on Wilson’s keyboards, which add a wobbly, new wave halo to the edges of “Silver and Gold” and “Drive.” But for all the punchiness on display, the band also find space for brooding outliers, like the lonesome piano ballad “Curse” and the unnerving, funereal “Birthday.” “You don’t write, you don’t call,” laments Wilson on “Come Back.” She doesn’t get the reassurance she needs by the song’s end, but that hardly seems the point.

The album doesn’t really sound like free jazz, but then, it doesn’t fit neatly into any other genre, either. Grimm’s songs are pretty and fractured, moving from acoustic lyricism to clanking dissonance and feedback, as her lyrics slide from personal confession to semi-occult oddness. The opening track, “Ah Love Is Oceanic Pleasure,” sounds like a Gaelic keen against atmospheric pulsing, hissing, squeaking horror movie backgrounds—like Enya slowly being driven mad by Syd Barrett. “Ah love is oceanic pleasure / No race to finish life / And if I love you at my leisure / Give it time,” she sings, before launching into tarot card references. “Beautifully Alone” is completely different—like folk via Motown, a pop song about longing for solitude rather than some guy. “When I’m alone with you / I realize our love isn’t real,” she sings cheerfully before “doo-doo-doo”s come in, and the track swings back and forth between praises of love and “dreaming a dream of my own.” “So many images tangled in my head,” she wails, throwing in an incongruous rockabilly growl. It’s sweetly innocent and unsettlingly desperate all at once. “Fear Transforms into Love” is a psychedelic lament, with feedback hum, a slow Eastern-tinged beat, horns squiggling, and Grimm declaring, “Love turns into pain / I will try not to love you again / I will try not to care.” “I Don’t Believe You” is about sexual assault;  . The track is beautifully layered, with Grimm’s own voice multi-tracked, as she sings bitterly, “I wish that I could die / I wish that you would die too.” She touches on similar material in the title track, where her dissonant roars open up: “My heart is empty / My soul is empty too / I feel dead inside / Don’t you?” feels like a record that shattered and then was reassembled painstakingly from its jagged bits. The result is cracked and misshapen, but more precious for its fissures.", "genre": ["Folk", "experimental folk"]}
{"album": "GT ULTRA", "artist": "Guerilla Toss", "description": "For a band that started with naked shows and shuddering noise freak-outs on songs like “Be the Breeder” or “Gay Disco,” Guerilla Toss have gone a lot further than those volatile antics suggested. On their new album  , the band keeps this experimental spirit alive—but this is music to get people dancing. ’s jumble of ambient, funk, and post-punk isn’t exactly what anyone would call “poppy,” though, or “accessible,” which implies it’s somehow unchallenging. “Crystal Run” opens up with vocalist Kassie Carlson warbling “Change the frequencyyyyy” over murky synths and buzzing background chatter that makes good on  ’s blotter acid cover art, hurtling headlong into a weird trip. Still, the songs on  are bright and catchy, and Guerilla Toss’ fringe styles here are fueled by a genuine desire for exploration rather than cheap shock value. “Can I Get the Real Stuff” gives us the purest hooks of the sort they teased on their previous LP release,  . “TV Do Tell” is a neon-hued punk song in the tradition of X-Ray Spex, complete with tongue-in-cheek lyrics about media consumption. On past albums, Carlson’s lyrics were buried in the mix, but here they’re pushed up to the front: “Personal persona, can I get the real stuff / Swimming in the makeup”; “My eyes were on the screen of my own interests,” and lead single “The String Game” and the hectic “Dose Rate” pack in enough spoken word sections, scorched-Earth guitars, and sci-fi synth histrionics for plenty of repeat listens.

Insular, moody, and at times abstract,  captures sentiments rarely heard in Chaz Bear (formerly Bundick)’s work: self-doubt, loneliness, and, ostensibly, heartbreak. Although the album begins with an upbeat sentiment—“I just wanted everybody to have a good time”—things quickly get darker from there. “No Show,” for instance, offers up a bittersweet summation of Toro y Moi’s success, delivered in a beautiful cadence—“Wasn’t even thinkin’ we were going worldwide / Figured it was better than the Southern life”—but also presents the repercussions: a partner who eventually “got fed up with my ego.” Later, “Windows” finds him acknowledging a need for a “new state of mind” and “You and I” paints an unflinching picture of Bear working obsessively to distract himself from the aftermath of a relationship. Yet  is also jam-packed with exquisite arrangements that provide a counterpoint for Bear’s angst and confusion. “Labyrinth” possesses the sublime pulse of the Talking Heads’ “Naïve Melody,” and lead single “Girl Like You” is a smart R&B slow-burner that culminates in a radiant piano bridge. Bear has always had an ear for minute detail, and  is no exception. Those looking for a party album will not find it here. Frankly, it’s hard to imagine Bear’s exuberant band even tackling these compositions live. Instead,  is a challenging and rewarding album, capturing a restless and ambitious composer as he takes a leap of faith and brings his darker feelings into the mix. —", "genre": ["Pop", "psychedelic rock"]}

It’s a horror record you wish  end, because in their world, queer people are in power.  is a clever repositioning of horror dynamics; the queer protagonist, Queen of the Vampires, ushers in the end of the human race. But this is a moment to cheer after the oppression, violence, and bigotry she experiences at the hands of humans earlier in the record. The band, all trans people, repurpose horror here to be a tool of empowerment, and a triumphant narrative for trans and non-binary people everywhere. Over the Bowie-esque schoolyard romp of “Teachers,” framed as a conversational call-and-response between an authority figure and the young Queen, frontwoman Mira Glitterhound weaves a patchwork of questions and answers queer people are subject to receiving and giving: “Do you hear what all the children say? Why they won’t have you over to play?” Glitterhound spits back, “’Cause I would set them on fire!” From the   theatrics of “Bigotry & Barbecue” to the Queen-styled choral intro of “Star,” the band create vivid, engaging places and stories across the record, set to delightful ‘70s rock and power pop. Sweeping Exits borrow from the sounds and aesthetics of Alice Cooper and New York Dolls to reanimate shock rock, and imagine a world where queer vampires feast on the blood of bigots.

In their familiar-to-some blend of classic rock, hardcore, melodic punk, and rootsy country-grunge, Lee Bains III and the Glory Fires insists on a version of Southern rock that interrogates its region’s history while explicitly fighting for Southern progress. With its sprawling 17-song tracklist,  finds Bains zeroing in his focus as a songwriter. The album is primarily an expansive, multi-angled exploration of the way in which Bains’s hometown of Birmingham socializes its children along racial and class lines. Songs like “Black & White Boys” and “Good Old Boy” are fierce polemics that jolt the band’s message into sharp clarity, while the album centerpiece triplet of “I Heard God!,” “Crooked Letters,” and “I Can Change!,” complete with a sample of children chanting and audio snippets of protester rallying calls, show off the band’s  -level ambition. Bains is a bookish songwriter whose intersectional Southern-punk has always been interested in the colliding worlds of religion, history, gender, and identity. With  , he’s made his most thoroughly urgent album, one that concerns itself with the problems of the here and now more thoroughly, and convincingly, than any of his previous work, which tended to be more historically-minded.

{"album": "Inside a Quiet Mind", "artist": "Micronism", "description": "Trying to find out much about Micronism, aka Denver McCarthy, isn’t easy. The mysterious New Zealand electronic music act was part of a burgeoning ‘90s electronic scene in New Zealand after which he released two albums and was never heard from again. One of those albums,  was initially released in 1998 on New Zealand label Kog Transmissions, which began as a collective of New Zealander electronic musicians who lacked other outlets to share their music. The other album, released under his name Denver McCarthy, was devoted to the gurus of Hare Krishna and won the Best Independent Album Release award at the 2000 BNet New Zealand Music Awards. Micronism’s obscurity adds both weight and value to the reissue of  , which is available digitally and, for the first time, on vinyl through Loop Recordings Aot(ear)oa. Touches of acid, breakbeat, and glitchy ambient abound, but the album never sticks to any one clear genre. Instead, Micronism uses genres as a tool, employing elements from dub techno, acid, house, and ambient to form a sound built for both introspection and movement. Floating synths, contemplative chords, and soft glitches create space to reflect, while heavy kicks and pads rouse and revive. The track “First Reflections” falls into the latter category: the rhythm is steady and propulsive, and synths sparkle and flash like strobe lights in a dark room. “Restless Address” is moodier, drums reduced to a pinprick of sound, enveloped by mist-like electronics. The tracks are woven together, creating a single, seamless musical experience. Taken in full, Micronism has created a universe of energy and lightness—it’s an album just as effective in solo listening as it is on the dancefloor. —", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance", "techno"]}
{"album": "Earl Grey", "artist": "Girl Ray", "description": "Songs that focus on the travails of adolescence are as old as pop music itself. Teen group  ’s debut   takes on that time-honored trope by reaching beyond its years, finding a convincing simplicity to its unified compositions. Vocalist Poppy Hankin has a light, disarming vocal approach; verses like, “I have waited quite some time / Stood my ground, and fuck you’re not obliged,” only feel more impactful. In this instance, her words feel weighty, emotionally honest and resilient. The North London outfit open up with spartan rhythms and playful jangling on “Just Like That,” which has a bit of a Velvet Underground feel. Gentle flourishes of keys, strings, and trumpet throughout the album add warmth and texture. On the album’s Carole King-esque power ballad single, “Stupid Things,” a piano takes over; there’s a truly classic Brill Building essence to what Girl Ray does, from irresistible pop hooks to heavy-hearted lyrics. What makes   an extra-compelling listen is Girl Ray’s commitment to studio exploration, choosing to experiment rather than cement one sound. They toy with tempo and tone on “A Few Months,” managing three distinct movements in four minutes. “Cutting Shapes” begins with a nodding chug of organ and percussion that splits at the seams for a nervy, clamorous finish. The most pronounced example of this is the 13-minute “Earl Grey (Stuck in A Groove),” an exercise in lo-fi moodiness that gradually unfurls into a meditative, proggy trance. Hankin gets lost in her thoughts here, musing freely as lovelorn teenagers do: “I’ve got a little bit of time to give / But I’ll cut it in half if you want more too.” What Girl Ray lack in experience is never an issue on  ; instead the trio exude youthful curiosity and abundant pop charm.", "genre": ["Pop", "indie pop"]}
{"album": "Kawaida", "artist": "Mim Suleiman", "description": "Electronic dance music often intersects with the intensely rhythmic music of Africa, whether it’s Basic Channel’s Mark Ernestus mixing with Senegalese mbalax, or  , where producers remixed Hugh Tracey’s field recordings from the 1920s through the ‘70s. But leave it to idiosyncratic producer Maurice Fulton to dig deeper and go weirder. Fulton’s résumé spans genres, from adding keys to Crystal Waters’s mid ‘90s tracks to funking up the likes of !!!, Hot Chip and Róisín Murphy. Since 2010, he’s worked most often with the Zanzibar-born, Sheffield-based Swahili vocalist Mim Suleiman. While Fulton’s workload waxes and wanes, his work with Suleiman has been constant;   marks their fourth effort together. All the earmarks of a Fulton production are in full effect here: live drums tangle with both programmed beats and crackling Afro-Cuban percussion, electronics blip and gurgle like Pac-Man at the bottom of a swamp, keyboard bass lines rumble like Jabba the Hutt with gas, echo and delay fx are deployed at just the right moment to maximize the more psychedelic moments. Suleiman’s powerful pipes are the perfect match for every last trick in Fulton’s playbook. Timbales break out amid “Kwanini” and a church organ swoops in to accentuate Suleiman’s stacked vocals. A proper techno kick powers the club-burning “Mzinga,” but Mim holds her own against the rhythm. As all manner of digital hiccups dribble across the crisp live drums of “Maso Maso,” Mim’s brassy voice remains front and center; she remains the song’s focal point, even as everything else in the mix starts to get dubbed out and gaseous. Unless you have a full grasp of Swahili, the topics of Suleiman’s songs will elude your grasp. The album’s title translates as either “reason” or “tradition” (though it can also refer to the philosophy of nationalist, pan-Africanist, and socialist ideologies). Whatever it is that Suleiman is singing about, let’s at least hope her work with Fulton remains a recurring tradition. —", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"]}

Lily West, Gussie Larkin, and Abe Hollingsworth, known collectively as the post-punk band Mermaidens, call Wellington home, too, and their determination, work ethic, and colorful vintage clothes have helped them to stand out amid the city’s vibrant culture. They owe a lot to the city and its greenery, which inspired their debut album  . On their new album,  , they turned their attention to the sun and how its warmth washes over one’s skin and creates positive energy. Larkin says while writing the album, she and West had been “thinking and talking about pleasure and pressure” and “the contrast of being in a blissful state, but with an underlying anxiety or uncertainty being present, too.” The album captures this duality on the title track, which opens with the line “Your perfect body won’t save you now,” and again on second track “Sunstone,” when they sing “Don’t let me overwhelm you.” The band declares an admiration for Sleater-Kinney and Warpaint, and that influence can be heard on “Mind Slow” and “Give It Up,” where the guitars have a more fluid pop-inflected flavor, and fold nicely around the vocals. “Sunstone” and “Satsuma” are both a little grittier, and are driven by pummeling bass rhythms that give the lyrics a more sinister quality. On “Satsuma” they sing, “You were sweet like satsuma, when I peeled you off and split you in two,” before repeating the line “Don’t live in bad dreams, think about the good things.” Both songs highlight the band’s willingness to bring depth and dissonance into their music.  is also a significant release for the iconic   label.

In the Detroit-based collective, anyone other than the human airhorn almost seems superfluous. Brown is the magnet, the charge, the force, and the fury. To draw attention away from a power like that requires both skill and outsized personality. ZelooperZ, one of Brown’s running mates in the Bruiser Brigade, also has a unique rapping cadence, and he let his eccentricities shine on his 2016 debut,  . But that record lacked the cohesiveness and aesthetic unity that’s made Brown one of the biggest rappers around. And so, much like how Brown teamed with producer   for the large bulk of  , ZelooperZ has paired up with Zach Saginaw (aka Shigeto), dubbing the resulting union ZGTO. Their debut,  , proves they’re perfectly suited to one another’s styles. Shigeto, born in Ann Arbor but now living in Detroit, has been a pioneer within Ghostly International’s electronic community for some time, blending aquatic synths to create house-leaning techno that bears traces of Detroit’s sonic influence without relying too heavily on it. On  , ZelooperZ (born Walter Williams) and Shigeto harness their strengths to maximal results, making songs that drown in layers of sludge, sport half-sung vocals, and trip along to off-kilter, untethered beats. Shigeto reins in ZelooperZ’s stream-of-consciousness tendencies by pairing his words with heavily emotive instrumentation. “I’mma live forever for my enemies,” ZelooperZ says on album opener “Drownin in the Paint.” The exact opposite of Waka Flocka’s similarly-named anthem, “Hard In Da Paint,” ZelooperZ’s voice is constantly slipping, dancing around the beat with the loose cadence of a man who seems like he can’t be bothered. He stays remarkably engaging in spite of his freewheeling approach: In his mind, he’s better at rapping than you are, and this album is an exercise in showing precisely how, and in what ways. With the help of Shigeto, Williams is able to situate his scattershot rap style within a distinct framework, and his work is better for it. While Shigeto isn’t necessarily treading unmarked terrain on  , he matches ZelooperZ’s distinctive quality song-for-song, narcotizing his frenetic style in favor of something more emotionally pummeling and dark. “Band Man” is a slow-motion anthem, while “Off Dat” gifts ZelooperZ’s haunted-house vocals an equally spooky meandering synth line. While ZelooperZ’s threatens to steal the show with his newfound consistency and vision, Shigeto is the stylist behind the show. Like all good collaborative projects,   succeeds because both artists are hellbent on bringing the best out of each other.

But more recently, he’s turned his attention to a less mainstream pursuit: celebrating Jean-Jacques Perrey and the influential music he made with the Ondioline, a French electronic keyboard. The instrument, invented by Georges Jenny in 1941, was a precursor to contemporary synthesizers, and Perrey’s earnest efforts with it served as building blocks for the synth music of the next half-century.  , the first release from de Backer’s new enterprise, a record label called Forgotten Futures, is a fascinating collection of snippets that pulls back the curtain on the provenance of early electronic music. Much of the songs on   are experimental little sound bites, crackly recordings of Perrey demonstrating the Ondioline’s abilities. He runs through instruments sounds, mimicking a French horn, banjo, oboe, castanets, violin, mandolin, and even a cat’s meow; some, like the bongos and the cello, are more convincing approximations than others. The set also features a few more fully-formed numbers that occasionally find Perrey in collaboration with other artists. “L’âme des Poètes,” with Charles Trenet, is a beautiful, dreamy ballad that brings to mind a soft-focused midnight stroll through Paris in a romantic drama.

It’s easy to see Heinali listening to fellow countrymen  , or vice versa, especially as the track hits the five-minute mark and it starts to emit a feedback-driven, wailing howl, coupled to a frantic drumming groove. It’s like a soundtrack for fleeing in dreamlike slow motion from wolves across a frozen tundra. Finney’s spoken word contributions are mostly mixed low—inflectionless nightmare whispers. “Maybe you stumble out of the wilderness four years later and you think you still have something to say, but all you do is go from desperate moment to desperate moment,” he mutters on “Wilderness.” “Lose your hair, lose a child, your dad dies,” he adds, his bland inertia and despair increasingly drowned out by Heinali’s shimmering symphony of moans—a fleet of ghosts eating literary fiction’s corpse. What’s so special about the collaboration is that self-immolation of interior monologue, as the voice narrating shame and self-disgust vanishes into rising unholy noise.", "genre": ["Ambient", "dark ambient"]}
{"album": "Jen Cloher", "artist": "Jen Cloher", "description": "Few songwriters tackle autobiography as unflinchingly as Melbourne’s Jen Cloher. Even Cloher’s famous wife and collaborator, Courtney Barnett, doesn’t quite approach the level of scouring self-examination and fearless venting that Cloher makes routine against the full-band rock of her self-titled fourth album. “Indie rock is full of privileged white kids / I know because I’m one of them,” she sings on the T. Rex strut of “Shoegazers,” which also skewers music critics (“Those who can, they do / Those who can’t, review”) as well as anyone who confuses commercial success with artistic fulfillment. That song sprang from Cloher’s experiences on tour with Barnett, who also plays guitar in Cloher’s band. Others, like “Sensory Memory” and lead single “Forgot Myself,” are about the psychological pitfalls of staying home while your wife is on the road for months on end. Typical of Cloher, “Forgot Myself” is generous with references, casually citing peers like The Drones and Patti Smith before paraphrasing two iconic lines from The Stones: “You’re riding round the world / You’re doing this and you’re signing that.” “Loose Magic” is a freewheeling fable about the power of live music that was inspired by Dirty Three; “Great Australian Bite” is about Aussie bands that nearly destroy themselves moving overseas to make it. Those referential flare-ups only fuel the gnashing release of Cloher’s songwriting, which can call out Australia’s piss-poor progress on marriage equality (“Analysis Paralysis”) just as easily as it can celebrate her sexuality (“Strong Woman”) and articulate the depth of her love (closing ballad “Dark Art”). She even strikes out into Bacharach-meets-Callahan jauntiness on the distinctly hopeful “Waiting in the Wings.” Released on Cloher and Barnett’s own reliable label, Milk! Records, this idiosyncratic LP dispenses frank social commentary all the way to therapy. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}
{"album": "Devil Electric", "artist": "Devil Electric", "description": "Australia isn’t known for its swamps, but if there are any near Melbourne, that’s where you would find Devil Electric. Murky and enigmatic, their old-school doom metal rises out of the bayou like a sultry bog witch, throwing an electric funeral for the Delta blues. They certainly aren’t the first to inject that Southern swagger into classic metal. They just do it with a singular panache. The voodoo rituals on could make the dead get up and dance. Pierina O’Brien’s ominous figure on the cover recalls the mystery woman who adorns the first Black Sabbath record, and I suspect that’s deliberate. Devil Electric don’t exactly hide their Sabbath worship, but they also don’t let it get in their way. Tom Hulse’s bass intro to “The Sacred Machine” is pure Geezer Butler. Still, even on that song, Christos Athanasias’s guitar work has a southern bite that distinguishes it from Tony Iommi’s. And you would never mistake O’Brien for Ozzy Osbourne. Her throaty howl continues a blues rock lineage that stretches from Janis Joplin all the way to Royal Thunder’s Mlny Parsonz and Blues Pills’ Elin Larsson. Drummer Mark Van De Beek rounds out the quartet, his drums bringing a welcome swing that they lacked on their previous   EP. Tom Glover’s production makes it all sound devilishly heavy. The thickness of the sonic gumbo wouldn’t really matter if the songwriting wasn’t catchy, but Devil Electric didn’t neglect that ingredient. “Monologue (Where You Once Walked)” sets the tone perfectly, bouncing from foot to foot in mocking revelry. O’Brien’s vocals on “Shadowman” ooze libidinous tension, “Lady Velvet” tightens the screws until the guitars explode into violence, “The Dove & the Serpent” uses the dynamics between the minimalist verses and fuzzed-out choruses to create an apocalyptic mood. Much as Black Sabbath appropriated the blues in their own way, these Australians successfully take sounds that originated halfway around the world and decades in the past and make them their own.

{"album": "Pumpkin EP", "artist": "Nemui PJ", "description": "The debut EP from like-minded artists Kidkanevil and Noah—who together form Nemui PJ—is the result of a U.K.-Japan connection cemented through a mutual love for creating music in their pajamas (“Nemui PJ” roughly translates to mean “sleepy pajamas”). That love of comfort led to the creation of  , a six-track EP (with four remixes) that seems designed to soundtrack gentle slumber. Each song is blissful and dreamy, equally meditative and musically engaging. The appeal is due in large part to the rich layers of vocals and instrumentation, especially on lead single, “Pumpkin.” The looping melodies build and circle one another, gliding atop the electronic drums, accentuating Noah’s ghostly vocals. The album also features the first appearance by Kidkanevil as a vocalist; he appears on closing track “Goodbye Matane.” In an interview with  , Kidkanevil said his collaborator insisted he provide vocals   on the EP. And while he obliged, Kidkanevil also made sure they were buried deep in the background, so his voice sounded like an additional instrument, or digital effect (rather than the more upfront vocals provided by Noah). That decision to “hide” his voice is an indication of why   is so successful: it plays out like a true collaboration, with no one half hogging the spotlight. Anyone familiar with Kidkanevil or Noah’s previous work knows they have a penchant for creating music that lands on the drowsier side of the spectrum, but rarely has either of them grasped what it means to be truly   in that restfulness. In a world full of humanoid worker bees, it’s comforting to hear a record so keen on relaxation. —", "genre": ["Ambient", "chill out"]}

Throughout the assortment of tracks from that archive, provided here by Ostinato Records, shockingly powerful and adept vocals sung in Somali twist and turn through haunting harmonic minor scale frameworks. Nimco Jamaac’s “Buuraha U Dheer (The Highest Mountains)” is a soaring mid-tempo rocker with winding synth and string parts running counter to the gorgeous vocal melody. With its slow-rolling blues tempo and chicken-scratch guitar hitting on the on half-note downbeat, Iftiin Band (featuring Mahmud Abdalla “Jerry” Hussen and Maryan Naasir)’s “Xuduud Ma Leh Xubigaan (This Love Has No Boundaries)” is reminiscent of a psychedelic, East African take on James Brown’s classic “King Heroin.” When Naasir takes over the start of the second verse, her shining soprano cuts through the mix with fire and passion. The majority of the tracks here posses many similar aesthetic characteristics: rickety electric organs, reverb, tape delay-saturated vocals, and the percussion-heavy rhythms of Northeast Africa. One could characterize the recording aesthetic here as “lo-fi,” but when listening to the songs of love, passion, devotion, and celebration compiled on  it is abundantly clear that there is something deeper happening here. The musical choices made on these recordings were both borne out of necessity and are a reflection of the unique tastes and triumphs of Somalia’s musical community—and, by extension, the Somali people. As brilliant as this and similar compilations are, they will not stop the violence or free the Somali people from the cycle of war, poverty, and the aftermath of Western neocolonialism that plagues many nations on the African continent. Despite this grim reality, it is apparent that the salvaging, archiving, and distribution of these recordings is a small, yet incredibly important, part of the work of reconstructing Somalia’s rich and ancient cultural history.", "genre": ["World", "African", "Soul"]}

There’s an organic, childlike playfulness to the producer’s entire discography (just listen to his fantastic   release,  ).

But their approach is decidedly psychedelic: where much of punk favors distinct riffs and big, melodic hooks, Weeping Icon instead drape loose blankets of guitar over ramrod percussion. In a short time, they’ve become one of New York’s most captivating live bands, and in the concert setting, they extend songs to epic length, letting the layers of hypnotic sound pile up one on top of the other, and allowing the songs to wander instead of move directly from point A to B. The effect is absorbing and mirage-like, wavy, distorted chords dissolving from concrete noise to abstract sound. They capture that same sense of free-roaming adventure throughout  . Though most of its songs remain comfortably inside of four minutes, there’s the sense that they could go on four times as long and not lose any power. Instead of bludgeoning with force, they unnerve you with repetition. Album standout “Teeth (& A Handbag)” tells the same story of a subway robbery over and over; the song’s lyrics feel jarring at first, then determined, then, finally, furious. The music works in tandem; the bass and drums adhere rigidly to a single pattern, but the guitars billow out infinitely, filling all available airspace with sound. When they finally arrive at the idea of revenge, it appears in a kind of chilling moral isolation chamber—it’s presented, but never commented or acted upon. The rocketing “Jail Billz,” a snarling tale of street harassment, follows a similar M.O.: guitars saw away at a single transfixing riff while the cold-eyed drumming rockets forward at a furious pace. The walls collapse and the song seems to expand outward endlessly.   isn’t an experimental record so much as an   one.

Lee, who plays all the instruments, creates grinding death metal grooves that keep slowing down to a doom-paced trudge, not unlike Japanese semi-legends  . The album opener “Guillotine” starts with classical Chinese flourishes, cut off by a baby’s cry and a fat, trundling metal riff. That sound is consistent throughout; whether you’re listening to “Prolapsing Malevolence,” “Repugnant Cultivation,” or “Caustic Anatomized Stench,” your head bangs to the same heavy-heeled march. The music is satisfying in its unabashed filth; the vocals, by Wang, though, are almost miraculous, bubbling up from guttural depths plumbed by few since  ’s Antti Boman paved the way. Wang doesn’t so much sing as gurgle—a monstrous, burping gargle that suggests approaching sandworms experiencing intense intestinal upheaval. At points, like at the beginning of “Feeding the Disavowal,” he sounds like he may be forming words, but whether they’re in English or Mandarin or some language too hideous to be named—no one can possibly understand them well enough for him to incriminate himself.

{"album": "Beast Epic", "artist": "Iron & Wine", "description": "“Killers, let go.” Is it a request? A demand? A prayer? All three? It’s the first refrain on the lovely, dense  , and for an album that is far more adult love songs and folk-shamble than overt politics, that line can’t help but resonate in a moment like the present. Born in South Carolina, Sam Beam (doing business as   since 2001 or so) is a Mid-Atlantic/Southeast native; he went to college in Richmond, VA, currently lives in North Carolina, and has lived in Florida and Central Texas. His work has always felt homegrown in a Southern college town—perhaps a town inhabited by smart goof-offs like Wooderson from  , or those who grew up listening to R.E.M.

It’s easy to forget how whispery-gorgeous and moving Beam’s debut,  , and the nearly-as-excellent follow-up,   were, how much they spoke to indie kids and psych-folk nerds alike, how they answered the musical question, “What if Paul Simon was a young, gentle post-9/11 dad with a four-track?” Save for the stunning epic tune “The Trapeze Swinger” from his double-album  , nothing that Beam has done since quite captured those albums’ verklempt intimacy. But  released on  , sounds like an update of those early works, a smooth amalgam of mature emotion and full-band acoustic craft; you’d be hard-pressed to find an electric guitar anywhere. Recorded nearly live in Chicago,   works best when Beam’s melodies are simplest and most direct (like on album opener “Claim Your Ghost” and “Bitter Truth”). Teddy Rankin Parker’s cello and Joe Adamik’s floppy drums give even the slighter tunes a pleasing acoustic ramble that recalls Dylan’s   a bit. Does one miss the kids-are-sleeping whisper? A bit.

Equal parts realism and romanticism,   guides the listener through the journey of life with a sense of poise and patience. While there is a destination in mind—a calm future, illustrated by a series of serene settings that crop up throughout the record—Nassau cherishes the voyage, and puts their faith in the natural goodness of the world.  opens at the pace of a new mountain stream—alive and steady, but tranquil. “We all get lost…but over time we turn around,” sings Wilcox on “Over Time,” showcasing his overt optimism and fondness for natural imagery. Those two threads run throughout the record; later, on songs like “Whatever Brings You Peace of Mind” and “Risin’ Sun,” the duo dabble in Appalachian folk, electric and acoustic guitars floating and swirling like fallen leaves in the breeze. On “Champagne” and “Long Arc,” two of the album’s more rollicking tracks, the quicker pace injects a welcome enthusiasm into the proceedings. Lyrically,   is fixated on transitions, natural and otherwise. There’s a palpable yearning—for resolution, or maybe simply order—throughout the record, but the songs never succumb to the anxiety of waiting. “Spring comes slowly don’t you know / Winter is over now you can go home,” Wilcox calmly sings on “Risin’ Sun.” The thaw comes again on the aptly-titled “Spring,” a song that starts with uncertainty (“Spring / I often wonder what you’ll bring”), ends with positivity and surrender (“Despite all my places to hide / You’ve always been kind”). At  ’s conclusion, the dreamy “Ain’t It Time,” we reach our destination, no longer looking forward, but embracing the power of the present.

Less varied and experimental than its predecessor, 2012’s playful and sometimes trippy  is an apt album for our new end times. Dancefloor seducer “Freakin'” pays nostalgic homage to the squiggly keyboard lines and Prince-inspired guitar riffs of the ’80s. Singing in neutral, unaffected voices, vocalists Barnaby Weir and Daniel Weetman evoke a cautionary cool all the more frightening for its neutrality. When the title track arrives on wings of fathomless ragga bass midway through the album, it’s unclear if the titular fabric—of a love affair, society, whatever—is repairable or permanently frayed. Feelings of disquiet increase in the album’s home stretch, beginning with Noam Chomsky’s dire spoken intro to “Beleza”: “In the global scene we are racing towards a precipice which we are determined to fall over which will sharply reduce the prospects for decent survival.” To which Weir adds the existential double-whammy, “Time and money / All it brings you is trouble.” We’re soon in deep water indeed during the cemetery funk and spooky keyboard layers of “Lost in the Bush,” an echoing nightmare in which “the mothers pull the anchor in the cold dead of night.” No, all is not rainbows and good vibes in New Zealand, but the Black Seeds deliver enough buoyant reggae-funk to cut the dread. —", "genre": ["Reggae", "rocksteady", "funk rock"]}
{"album": "Colours of the Night", "artist": "Maalem Mahmoud Gania", "description": "When some Westerners think of religious music, they may imagine choral voices and slow tempos—something serious and solemn. Of course, the truth is that religious music is diverse as secular music is; some of it is slow and sad, but much of it is uptempo and designed to get you to shimmy. That’s certainly the case for Maalem Mahmoud Gania’s recent release,  , Gania’s final studio recording, issued posthumously following his death in 2015. Gania was a Moroccan performer of Gnawa, an Islamic religious tradition of music, dance, and ritual poetry. He played the guembri, a three-stringed bass lute. Gania had been involved in a range of eclectic collaborations, including the 1994 album   with Pharoah Sanders and a 1996 recording with Peter Brötzmann.   is a more traditional outing, though. The songs on the album all range from eight to 11 minutes in length, and they all blur into each other, a single, 70-minute long trance. The guembri sets up a supple, rhythmically intricate, shifting bassline and shaken percussion adds an itchy beat. Gania raises his voice in a wailing voice that’s half-sung, half-chanted, while background singers join in for a call and response. For American listeners, Gania sounds less like the avant-garde jazz you might expect given his earlier collaborations, and more connected to acoustic blues and gospel; a soundtrack for staying up all night as you fall into the music and into the spirit. While you can find more familiar aural touchstones for Gania’s music, though, it really sounds most like   the album celebrates a unique, easy, and joyful devotion.", "genre": ["World", "African", "traditional"]}

{"album": "Relatives in Descent", "artist": "Protomartyr", "description": "On their first two albums, Protomartyr turned a jaundiced eye toward their immediate surroundings, documenting nasty displays of violence—both interpersonal and systemic—that cropped up throughout their home city of Detroit. On their third album,  , they expanded their scope, trying to dig up the   of that violence in religion, philosophy, and biology. On  , their focus has become even more diffuse. Early in the haunting opener “A Private Understanding,” frontman and lyricist Joe Casey declares: “Not by my own hand / Automatic writing by phantom limb,” and much of   seems to follow that M.O. Gone are the “hawks ripping out liars’ eyes” and “dogs eating their young.” In its place is language that’s looser and even more stream-of-consciousness. The grinding “Here is the Thing” feels like a bleak MadLib of contemporary catastrophes, Casey itemizing, “New face loves surveillance, comic sans, parroting an ape” as the band kicks and grunts behind him. On the tumbling “The Chuckler” Casey balefully sings, “War and rumors of war / Clouds of poison in the sky and poison in the soil,” before delivering the kicker: “Lord, how I wish there was a better ending to this joke.” The pensive “Up the Tower” condenses the album’s entire thematic thrust into one microcosm: it begins with Casey sharing a cigarette with a man on a corner, but as the song goes on, the lens widens: Protesters burst through police blockades and storm a mansion until they reach “the golden door”—the entire song shifting from the personal to the political to, arguably, the theological in the space of 90 seconds. Throughout  , the band scales outward to match the lyrics’ wide grasp. On their first two albums, they felt feral and unglued, but on   they began softening the edges of their sound. They continue that expansion on   to spectacular effect. The opening of “My Children” is chilling in its spareness, just a few icicle-like guitars from Greg Ahee dripping slowly in the background as bassist Scott Davidson and drummer Alex Leonard stalk the song’s edges. Even when it gains speed, it still feels open and harrowing, Ahee preferring bent-wire post-punk leads over brick-like riffing. “Night-Blooming Cereus” is the closest thing to a ballad the band has written yet, floating along on an eerily-serene synth line, Ahee’s guitar appearing only in lightning-flashes. Casey has grown exponentially as a vocalist in the short five years since  ; for much of  he adopts a kind of weather-beaten croon, all the better to serve the band’s increasing fondness for empty spaces. If Protomartyr have a clear antecedent, it’s The Fall, another band who paired knotty guitar work with declamatory vocals and lyrics that are, by turn, cutting and obscure. But where The Fall seemed content to submerge themselves in the acid of cynicism, Protomartyr have always looked for opportunities to come up for air. At the end of “The Chuckler,” Casey seeks solace in a phone call with “A direct-marketer from Bangalore.” They talk about life and the weather and the fact that the person on the other end of the phone shares a name with a friend of Casey’s. It’s a small detail, but on an album preoccupied with global ruin, it also offers a few seconds of hope. Even now, in an age lit by burning cities, surviving on polluted water and expired food, human connection—even between a rock singer and a customer service representative—is still possible.

That’s the question that Daphni, the dance music-minded alias of Caribou’s Dan Snaith, seems to be asking. While his main outfit has evolved from a post-rock project to a more electronically-inclined enterprise over the years, Snaith’s work as Daphni has set its sights expressly toward the dancefloor, with a particular allegiance to house music and its soulful variants in their most organic forms. Like Four Tet, a close friend and collaborator who established himself as a dance music master only after loosening up slowly, over the course of several years, Snaith’s earliest certifiable “club music” tracks had an uptightness and uprightness that have faded away. The result has been transformative, largely because the new songs exhibit a true ability to swing—to play around more freely with syncopation and entertain genre expectations that can just as easily be upended. is related to Daphni’s recent DJ-mix release  , for which Snaith created a new array of original tracks and edits to twist together into a tightly coiled sequence over an extended 74-minute spell.   presents tracks from that mix in longer versions—plus the unreleased “Vulture,” which has been passed around only by way of some of Daphni’s DJ friends. The other 11 tracks were conceived to serve their respective purposes in particular spots of the   mix, meaning that changes in speed and tweaks in volume (and so on) were integral to their duties as part of a mosaic whole. Those functional, purpose-minded aspects of the tracks are left intact to thrilling effect on   so much so that a listener can practically hear Daphni thinking out loud about the subtle shifts and mutations a DJ considers over the course of a set. “Poly” opens with a swell of synth arpeggios and cooing vocal snips that build before “Face to Face” comes on strong with drums and a bassline pared down to its essence. Adjustments in volume and dynamics abound over the course of five-plus minutes that grow funkier for all their little variations. Other tracks fluctuate in weight, and swing between big drama (“Xing Tian”) and small, slice-of-life sentiment (“Life’s What You Make It”).

Those simple words, delivered in Naggar’s comforting voice, arrive at the center of a piercing, intimate tale about pushing forward, leaving behind the demons that haunt you. “If After All” is a brief, unguarded glimpse of the Montreal singer’s journey toward growth and freedom. is full of moments like this, and Naggar’s wordplay, and the forcefulness and ingenuity of her writing, give each of them a sense of urgency. And while “If After All” boasts a manic arrangement, going t’s an outlier. On  , Naggar mostly dabbles in minimal folk (“Nothing”), occasionally shading her songs with hints of the blues (“In My Heart”). On “Devil’s Doubt,” a song about uncomfortably settling into adulthood and the sadness and wisdom that accompanies it, she gilds her sparse country with a cinematic string arrangement, adding both gravity and depth. That theatricality continues on “Lullaby,” featuring celebrated French Canadian composer . True to its name, the song is a strange, sad bedtime story, in which Naggar finds herself consciously maintaining her distance from a past love. Her haunting voice, the sparse, tinkling piano, and the soft guitar melody are blanketed in a thin layer of reverb that, much like the subject in the story she’s telling, keeps her at a distance from the listener. This is where Naggar shines, composing sonic experiments that perfectly embody the sentiments her lyrics contain. ends with the track “New Bed,” a song that’s about more than just Naggar getting new sheets. Under a veneer of static, she says goodbye to her old surroundings and her old friends, and welcomes—with some trepidation—the strangers that await in the future. And, once again, she vows to take life one day at a time. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "singer-songwriter", "Folk"]}

The band has referred to their latest offering as its “Americana” record, a comparison that starts to make sense when it’s not taken literally. Indeed,   is a record that gathers disparate influences and styles, including a variety of roots-indebted sounds, and merges them into a surprisingly cohesive whole: the infectious power pop of “Walkaway,” the album’s centerpiece; the experimental jazz stylings of “Scream,” which features Tanya Tagaq; the Tom Petty-esque heartland rock of “Grass;” and the gentle bedroom folk that begins “Puddle.” OLead singer Jasmyn Burke has also sharpened her focus as a songwriter, which is most apparent on socially-conscious anthems like “Wide Open” and “Scream.” “We are living in a time when misery is just common circumstance,” she sings on the latter. “I am frozen, I’m sublime, I am searching for some fresh watermelons.” Whether they’re incorporating fresh sounds or crafting newly-inspired punk didactics, Weaves has never sounded as self-assured, or as resolutely urgent, as they do on  . —", "genre": ["Rock"]}

Debut   was recorded at the same studio—Machines With Magnets—where Lightning Bolt cut 2015’s  , and packs a similarly throttling, panicky punch. Titled after a U.S. Park Ranger who was struck by lightning seven times, “Roy Sullivan” is a blazing, savage exclamation point, swimming with more guitar hooks, riffs, and textures than the ear can possibly isolate. Windmilling “UFO” and shape-shifting anthem “Let’s Build A Moon” somehow transmogrify amplifier sludge into psychedelic, anthemic forms. The pensive, imposing “Chainsaw” gratuitously apes its namesake; spewing kazoo effects like flop sweat, “Vampire Crane” suggests a   speed metal one-off single. Yet the thing that stands out most vividly on  is Friel’s increased confidence as both a singer and a lyricist. On Parts & Labor studio recordings, a certain hesitancy hampered his vocal performances. Here, even with his voice buried under and straining to tunnel up through heaps of feedback, he’s projecting with  . Exhortations of “C’mon, fellas,” bear a sincere, urgent weight, and he belts out “We’re falling through the waves” on “UFO” like the most ecstatic rollercoaster rider.

{"album": "Plum", "artist": "Wand", "description": "For their first album in two years, the LA band Wand expanded to a five-piece and bandleader Cory Hanson ceded some of the creative control he’d held since the group first appeared in 2013. For any other outfit, this would be just a blip on a bio, but on  that change in approach has yielded profound results. The album’s eight proper songs (there are a pair of instrumental asides) are rich and expansive, favoring texture and shading over the bongwater psychedelia of their first few outings. But a knowledge of Wand’s bleary past isn’t necessary to appreciate  ’s new beauty. The title track could be an outtake from Paul McCartney’s  : there’s a steadily-blinking piano, a roving bassline, a tangle of silvery guitar, and Hanson’s creamy tenor carrying a gently-drifting vocal melody. “Charles DeGaulle” is full of empty space; organ and guitar tumble out in tight bundles, and Hanson—sounding eerily like Thom Yorke—slips like a ghost in the vacancies between them. Even the more aggressive numbers are elegantly sculpted. The crunching “High Rise” opens with a greasy, bluesy guitar pattern, collapses briefly into cemetery silence, then the riff returns to ride the song through to its conclusion. And the grinding “Bee Karma” nicks the guitar line from “Pictures of Matchstick Men” and alternates between dreamlike verses and a big, roaring chorus. Hanson has said that the record was shaped by heartbreak, but nothing about   feels bleak or disconsolate. It’s instead a richly-detailed collection of guitar-forward psych-pop, building up rococo melodies one minute and setting them ablaze with blinding guitar work the next. —", "genre": ["Alternative", "psychedelic rock"]}

Chorused-out guitar hooks and nimble basslines abound on  , Havah’s third album, and it’s excellently recorded and sequenced, with the A-side more on the blistering post-punk tip and the B-side tending toward more experimental, spacious, industrial-influenced new wave (“Un’Altra Strada,” in particular, uses its rhythmic and melodic interplay in a particularly appealing way).

Whereas   strove to merge the traditional and the modern into a seamless whole, Freeman’s second album, produced once again by Teddy Thompson, tends to make its sonic distinctions clearer. On one hand, yearning mid-tempo country weepers like “If I Could Make You My Own” and “Lovers on the Run” display Freeman’s natural knack for pop melodicism, while songs like “Over There and “Ern and Zorry’s Sneakin’ Bitin’ Dog,” the latter of which was written by her grandfather, display how deeply rooted Freeman’s music is to her hometown of Galax, Virginia, a longtime hotbed of traditional music. But Freeman never seems constrained by her country roots. Jazz-inflected pop crooning and ’60s R&B all play a part in shaping Freeman’s aching blend of roots and folk.   marks a progression in songwriting for Freeman, who’s become precise in her phrasing and increasingly attuned to the narrative power of a simple piece of imagery. “All the cans, and the bottles too,” she sings on the haunting “That’s All Right,” “they’re piling up, you’re passing out, and I’m turning blue.” On her second album, Freeman updates her influences while fine-tuning her songwriting, and the result is one of the most self-assured singer-songwriter records of the year. —", "genre": ["Country", "singer-songwriter"]}

From that minimal instrumentation come meditations on melancholy, melodies that fold in on themselves, with Colleen weaving sounds together to create a choir of intricate chirps. On “Separating,” she whispers her lyrics with deliberateness. Her synth plays out like violin notes, and as the space grows, so does the rhythm. “Another world” circles on its own dizzying momentum. “Winter dawn” is among  ’s most striking moments, a song that pits beauty against tragedy, a slow-building synth sprawling out beneath her words. “The world had nearly ended yet the sky was blue,” she sings, “and I came home with a fistful of fear.” About four minutes in, as the electronics swell around her, she locates a moment of calm. None of this is accidental: Colleen   that this album was “composed over the course of a year marked by the constant presence of death.” She was in Paris on the night of the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, and wrote many of the songs after a close family member had fallen ill.

Originally released in 1983, the album is a collaboration between cult French composer and record producer Hector Zazou, Congolese singer Bony Bikaye, and electronic composing duo CY1. Vincent Kenis, who would later helm the Crammed Discs   series is also on board. The result is an album of glorious Afrofuturist electronic bleep and bump which sounds like it was transmitted from an alternate universe by funky retro-mainframes. Sometimes, collaborative world music albums discover one new vibe and stick with it from beginning to end. By contrast,   keeps spinning endless new variations on African boogie. “Dju Ya Feza” is a new wave rave-up reminiscent of a more metal-tinged, sweaty Talking Heads, with Bikaye growling and ominously declaiming the lyrics like a cross between Dracula and Cookie Monster. “Munipe Wa Kati” couldn’t be more different—a gentle lyrical tune with bird whistles set against electronic bloops and what sounds like a sawed violin. “Lamuka” is built on a foundation of repetitive, stiff keyboards, but adds in languid Afrobeat horns and Bikaye’s easy vocals; it’s “We Are the Robots” if the robots in question were AI implanted in flesh. The final track, “Woa,” is a joyful celebration of cross-cultural compatibility; the melody sounds a bit like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, but the echoey percussion of this collaboration avoids   terminal preciousness. The real revelation of the album, perhaps, is the balance it strikes between natural and artificial. Kraftwerk is often seen as a definitively European band, despite its huge influence on hip-hop and funk. But the ease with which Congolese rhythms fuse with echoes of “Trans-Europe Express” suggest that maybe the Germans had a computer-enhanced ear turned to another continent.

{"album": "Any Other Way", "artist": "Jackie Shane", "description": "When practically every song in existence sits somewhere on the internet, it’s difficult to discover a truly significant—but largely unknown—talent with a barely-heard body of work that fully testifies to their greatness: There’s got be a really profound reason, or a bunch of them, for their obscurity. Jackie Shane is such a find. Born and now living in Nashville, but a bona fide star in 1960s Toronto, Shane sang soul as if her life depended on it—because  . Not only is she an African-American who barely escaped the Jim Crow South, Shane also pioneered a transgender identity when few civilized words existed for a woman like her. More than 50 years after her heyday, it still takes major chops and charisma to overcome racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia, so you can imagine what it took for Shane to pack Toronto clubs week after week and land a major, long-lasting regional R&B hit on Top 40 radio—particularly when the population was almost all white. That transcendent force is all over her first comprehensive retrospective. Featuring every one of her collectable single sides from the ‘60s and the entirety of her rare 1967 live album plus bonus outtakes,   is a remarkable document from a sociological perspective, but just as impressive from a musical one. Clearly schooled in gospel, as well as her era’s southern soul icons, Shane sings with a rasp that’s akin to Sam Cooke or James Brown. Yet her equally exceptional stage patter is a one-of-a-kind cross of Baptist preacher and LGBTQ pathfinder—sassy, a tad mischievous, but also self-possessed. The fact that she served up both in stunning silk suits with bouffant hair and fully feminine makeup throughout the ‘60s when a transwoman like her could get arrested for merely walking down the street is mind-blowing. Her confidence is as staggering as her ability. Both land bracingly hard on the introductory cut, “Sticks and Stones,” the B-side to her late 1962 debut single. “I’ve been abused / Deep down in my  ,” she belts in this breakneck rendition of the soul standard, then recently popularized by Ray Charles. It’s one of several tracks that testify to the LGBTQ experience through borrowed material, and the way Shane sings it leaves no doubt she’s suffered profoundly. Yet she also radiates a toughness that suggests Shane’s not to be troubled by any trifling words that might come her way. And the rest of the arrangement similarly exudes defiance—check that positively giddy piano break: If it were any faster, those speedy notes would blur into chords. “Tell her that I’m happy, tell her that I’m gay / Tell her I wouldn’t have it any other way,” she croons in her definitive interpretation of William Bell’s “Any Other Way.” This was her Toronto smash, a number-two sensation on CHUM, the city’s reigning pop station; a breakout hit in several U.S. cities, and an enduring cult favorite across Canada that prompted a 1967 re-release. Even then, the present-day understanding of “gay” was employed almost exclusively by homosexuals—it was inside code, not common vernacular. As smooth here as she’s sharp elsewhere, Shane delivers her declaration with an easy assurance that crosses every kind of cultural divide. Her worldly monologues documented on the “live” section of the album are even more daring for the repeated use of the word “chicken,” which is gay slang for young men. She talks about “my woman” to satisfy the straight crowd who likely saw her as a man in makeup, but also speaks freely of her fondness for “chicken” so that her own people knew exactly what’s up. Shane was the featured attraction in Frank Motley and the Hitchhikers, a Toronto-based live band led by a trumpeter who played two horns simultaneously. Like some of her singles, they’re coarser than she is, but their roughness only highlights her magnetism. Sighing sweetly one moment, screaming righteously the next, Shane gives herself gospel-style—completely—in every song as if willing herself to a Promised Land right here on Earth. “I’m not gonna let you get me down ‘cause I got too much on the ball,” she announces on “Stand Up Straight and Tall.” Only the foolhardy would try. —", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

It’s as if the Maine native set out to answer the question she asks alongside the queasy chords and quiet stormfronts of “Red Dawn”: “What does it mean to wear your heart on your sleeve?” In Tullgren’s case, it means tightly wound tracks that tickle your brain with mournful vocal melodies, minimal-yet-muscular guitars, and drums that stumble, sputter, and strut like a fairly inebriated close friend.

{"album": "Trans-Millenia Music", "artist": "Pauline Anna Strom", "description": "Despite the adage, there   times when you can judge an album by looking at its cover. A prime example is the first album from the mysterious San Francisco composer Pauline Anna Strom. It features a rainbow-framed mandala with a blue sky, and in the center is a cracked egg with a Magritte-like eyeball staring back at you. It suggests a sound created far above Earth, surreal and heaven-bound. The uncanny synthesizer music contained within fully delivers on that promise. Released in an extremely limited edition back in 1982,   seemed to vanish immediately, fetching astronomical sums online. Six other LPs and cassettes followed throughout the decade in even smaller editions before Strom disappeared altogether. Outside of a few fervent fans—like MGMT and Legowelt—it seemed like her music was going to be lost to time. Now, the RVNG label presents an exquisite portrait of the enigmatic composer. This compilation contains four compositions from that album, as well as an array of tracks from her other albums. It’s an 80-minute collection that spans her work from 1982 to 1988, and it’s a psychedelic trip that elegantly dances between light and dark, ancient and futuristic. Most importantly, it casts much-needed light on the nearly forgotten composer. Born premature in Louisiana, an excess of oxygen caused complete optic nerve damage to the infant Strom, resulting in permanent blindness. As a child, she was drawn both to classical music as well as tales of ancient Egypt. She got caught up in the flower power of the ’60s and relocated to San Francisco’s Tenderloin District, where she’s lived since 1968. In the early ‘70s, she was taken in by the synthesized soundscapes broadcast by the Hearts of Space radio show in Berkeley, which introduced her to the likes of Tangerine Dream, Kitarō, Brian Eno, and Strom’s favorite, Klaus Schulze. Inspired, she began to explore music on her own in the wee hours of the night. The spirit of Schulze moves through her own music but, as   proves, Strom was a visionary in her own right. She may have been making synthesizer music in San Fran during the rise of New Age music in the early ‘80s, but her art slips outside of such easy categorization. It can feel relaxing and anxious at once. “In Flight Suspension” is as weightless as its title suggests, with quivering tones swooping down from across the stereo field, high frequencies sparkling at the edges. “Spatial Spectre” is a precursor to dark ambient, full of foreboding and tones liable to prickle your skin. Inversely, the giddy arpeggios of “Morning Splendor” are as magical and hushed as watching the first rays of a new day beaming over the horizon. It’s a perfect example of how Strom’s evocative touch on electronic keys conjures something warm and pastoral. —", "genre": ["Ambient", "Electronic"]}

Prior to recording  , the Skarstad brothers traveled for a month in Siberia, and they brought back field recordings—bells, barking dogs, ancient-sounding choirs—that serve as interstitial passages, separating the album’s six songs. They’re necessary breaks, because the songs themselves are intensely claustrophobic. As melodic as the brothers’ riffs may skew, the way they’re piled on top of one another, and intensified by the pummeling drumming of Mike Rekevics, makes each song on the album feel like a mausoleum. “Shrillness in the Heated Grass” offers a brief respite from the suffocating atmosphere, and it’s the album’s greatest triumph, as well as likely the best song Yellow Eyes have ever written. After opening with a melodic passage reminiscent of Watain’s “Underneath the Cenotaph,” the track toggles between sweaty, half-speed churn and frenzied melodic shred.

The album opens with “For You,” a chant-based piano ballad that quickly transitions from melancholy into urgency.

The subject matter is deeply personal yet comfortingly universal; given the body of work Underhill has amassed until now, this seems entirely intentional.

Later, in the slinky “Searching for a New Day,” Jones yearns for a fresh start; and the stately “These Tears (No Longer for You)” could easily be read as a kiss-off to a partner who doesn’t deserve her attention. In the end, there is no defeat to be found on Jones’s final recording. Instead, it is a testament to her faith in music and in the power of love. It is, like the voice and life of Miss Sharon Jones herself, an inspiration. —", "genre": ["R&B/Soul", "Soul"]}
{"album": "Ascending A Mountain Of Heavy Light", "artist": "The Body & Full Of Hell", "description": "Calling   a metal album is a bit like pointing your finger at Pablo Picasso and sputtering the word “painter.” Strictly speaking, yes, you’d be correct. But you’d also be giving insufficient indication of sheer level of batshit inventiveness and wild, uninhibited originality that is standing proudly before us. The Body have complained in the past that most modern metal music is played by unimaginative musicians who are influenced solely by other metal bands. Although certainly malevolently heavy, the duo’s own output has searched for inspiration in the worlds of hip-hop, pop, Beyonc  and Depeche Mode. The follow-up to last year’s  , this is The Body’s second outing with Full Of Hell, the latter a grindcore quartet who use electronics and noise-music techniques to enhance their fierce sound. Again, the combined acts have looked outside the narrow spectrum of metal and have this time drawn on reggaeton, jungle, and free jazz. The result is an eight-track onslaught of eerie chants and whoops, playful electronic glitches, brassy madness, industrial clanking, rumbles akin to Sub Pop-era Wolf Eyes, something that sounds like the looped moan of a tugboat’s horn, unexpected moments of oddly groovy dubbiness, and even, at one point, the jaunty and crisp rattles of what might be an undead marching band. In terms of the vocals, Dylan Walker of Full Of Hell follows in the grunting grindcore tradition pioneered by Napalm Death’s Nic Bullen. In contrast, The Body’s higher-pitched Chip King sounds like the kettle has just boiled in Leatherface’s horrible kitchen. Together, The Body & Full Of Hell don’t so much think outside the box, as they bludgeon the box to death and bury it in an unmarked grave.", "genre": ["Metal"]}

And sure enough,  is an eclectic set, with Charles’s supple vocals swooping in and out of jazz, fuzak, and pop. Charles uses her voice as a be-bop instrument, bouncing around the melody: leaping up to the top of her considerable range, slowing down and then catching up. But she’s no traditionalist; the album never sinks into the round-robin soloing structure of most jazz songs. “Purview” starts with a lovely lyrical dying-duck trumpet sound, courtesy of collaborator and co-producer  , before it slides into quasi-ambient ripples—think: “In a Silent Way” as vocal showcase. “Free of Form” throws in deep, fuzzy electronic keyboard, as her regular drummer John Davis scatters percussion around, landing just this side of funk. “The Struggle” is built on wispy, pulsing, multi-tracked vocalizations; Charles comes across as a kind of jazz Enya. “Zombie” has an honest to goodness, get-stuck-in-your-head pop hook—the Rihanna-like stuttered “Zombie-eh-eh-eh” on the chorus sounding like the song could be a radio hit, if it gets to the right DJs. The “Freedom” of the title doesn’t just refer to stylistic breadth; it’s also a quiet social message. On “March to Revolution Part II,” Charles wails with Grace Slick-esque stentorian power: “Will we let reason die? / When we know what we march for will we fight a revolution? / Revolution of real thought / Revolution of real mind.” Political freedom, spiritual freedom, and artistic freedom swirl around one another, part of the same picture, like the musical traditions Charles draws on. “So many songs have been left unsung,” she declaims.

Their sophomore LP,  , is a conceptual work based on the poem “Na skle maľovane.” In it, an 18th century Slovakian highwayman, Juraj Janošik, is executed in a gruesome—and kind of metal—way. He was skewered through the torso with a hook in 1713 for a series of Robin Hood-like robberies that extended throughout Slovakia, Poland, and Moravia. That backstory turns up in more than just  ’s lyrical themes and play-like intermissions: The cover art features a highwayman as he swigs from a bottle and wanders around surrounded by a field of psychotropic drugs—a great snapshot of the life of Janošik. Throughout  traditional Slovakian folk songs share space with fast-paced, straight-ahead, blazing black metal that’s loaded with traditional riffs, harsh vocals, and plenty of blistering leads. What’s so captivating about Malokarpatan’s take on black metal is the way they seamlessly blend the catchy, traditional aspects of the music into their darkened panorama. “V okresném rybníku hastrman už po stáročá vyčína” showcase Malokarpatan’s compositional skill and flat-out talent: Throughout the song’s six minutes, bluesy lead lines intersperse and overtake each blistering guitar solo, and the vocals both rise in fury and deepen threateningly. Other tracks hurtle at the listener—layered, choir-like vocals floating evilly from the speakers, then blasted into silence by treble-heavy, distorted leads. is, in its essence, a traditional metal album masquerading as black metal.

It’s also tied to a specific movement within that genre: twee, in the 1980s. And while bands who find inspiration in the past can often run the risk of sounding derivative, the quintet Spinning Coin (who recently opened for Scottish indie giants Teenage Fanclub) have found a way to mine Glasgow’s vintage sounds without sounding like mere mimics. On debut album   they craft distinctly human, nonlinear pop songs, with the aid of another Scottish indie giant—Orange Juice’s Edwyn Collins, who recorded the album along with  ’ Stu Evans. While nothing on  has a clear sonic reference point, the group’s ability to balance balladic, mournful moments with ‘60s-inspired jangle recalls indie forerunners  . Most of the songs deal with money—who has it, and who doesn’t—and the struggle for self-worth. “Sides” is a working class anthem, a rallying cry for anyone who’s ever slugged it out at a thankless, dead-end job. Album opener “Raining On Hope Street” is sugary-sweet dream-pop, full of soft declarations of love, like “If I had your heart / I’d give it to you,” and “Don’t be scared / I’m your friend.” Somehow these sentiments all work together—the romantic tropes of indie pop made malleable to fit Spinning Coin’s struggles with money, love, and alcohol.

The song was built for the times: tiny LED-blip synths, a steady, handclap rhythm, and Iqbal’s disembodied voice stuttering out robotic web-speak like, “hashtag OMG,” “LOL,” and “follow me.” It was a clever, slow-burn synth song, but it also felt a little bit cloying—another producer slowly testing the waters of the burgeoning  . All of that self-aware jocularity has been wiped clean on  , Iqbal’s stunning full-length debut, released under her own name (the “Throwing Shade” moniker has also been retired). Instead of doubling-down on “hashtag”’s fizzy electronics, Iqbal has shifted hard in the opposite direction, making music that recalls early ‘80s minimalists like Miaow and Section 25. The album opens with a tripping piano phrase, which is quickly suffused in cloudlike synths and topped with Iqbal’s drifting, far-off voice. That sets the tone for the record that follows: stark, shadowy numbers where synth is used as more of a gauzy wrapping than a driving force. There’s a beautiful, gothic melancholy to   Iqbal’s breathy voice gets tripped up in a tangle of silvery guitars on “Something More;” “Alone Together” uses a glassy waterfall of electronics to create a backdrop for Iqbal to construct a delicate latticework of guitar; “New New Eyes” opens as pulsing post-punk but the song gorgeously evaporates into mist on the chorus, leaving Iqbal’s voice suspended in mid-air. More than anything,   recalls the moment in UK pop history when the stern rigidity of bands like Joy Division was giving way to synth-driven—but not explicitly “dancey”—bands like The Wake.

Flitting between solemnity and capriciousness, “Untitled Piano Improvisation FD 6.9” wriggles like a butterfly that can’t quite escape its cocoon, while the soaring “Untitled Improvisation DCC 04.33.3” feels light, loose, and only slightly sinister. “Untitled Improvisation DCC 02.21” comes across like an earnest attempt to write an early 1980s sitcom theme, a national anthem for a fledgling nation, or maybe both at once. “Untitled Improvisation DAT 3.1 – 2.79” braids together shifting, seasick tones; even by  ’s meandering standards, that’s one disorienting isthmus. Eggleston is on firmer ground for a pair of covers. A watercolor mistiness lends a drowsy appeal to his brief, swoony version of Broadway standard “On the Street Where You Live.” For Gilbert & Sullivan’s “Tit Willow,” he sets aside the synths and reaches for a guitar, teasing the melody free via distinctive playing—a painstaking series of plectrum plucks and caresses—that recalls the late, great John Fahey.", "genre": ["Experimental", "improvisation", "avant-garde"]}

Recorded on a dictaphone by Trevor Adams, in front of an audience of 25 people, the band is still green, but the essential ingredients of their formula are already in place: Ben Gibbard’s knack for gently-surging vocal melodies, the delicately-woven latticework of guitar chords that support their best songs. The tender take on set opener “Your Bruise” is an indication of what’s to come: where the final version heaved into a full-band pitch-and-roll, the rendition here is exhaled like a sigh; Gibbard feels his way around the vocal melody cautiously, notes from his guitar drifting down like a soft snowfall. When the whole band joins in for “President of What?” it feels loose and clattering, a charming contrast to the recorded version’s sleek, streamlined approach. Here, the synth wheezes in the background like a melodica, rather than providing the shiny veneer that defines the version on  , the band’s 1998 debut ’s high point occurs at roughly the halfway mark, with a wrenching rendition of “Champagne from a Paper Cup.” The skeletal arrangement only serves to underscore the song’s deep sense of hurt, and the band, even in their first performance, are able to make it boil without exploding. Gibbard’s young voice sounds bereft as it wearily navigates the lyrics’ darkness. On  , Death Cab consists of Gibbard, Chris Walla, Nick Harmer on bass and Walla’s friend Nathan Good on drums. The performance was meant to be a one-off, but after hearing the raw power of this set, it’s hard to imagine they wouldn’t have continued.

The songs on   are longer and fiercer by comparison. If   was a tense trek through a rainforest,   is a long motorcycle drive on a highway at night. He sets the mood right out of the gate with the sprawling 13-minute opener “True Love,” where a misty blanket of sound is slowly pulled back to make way for broad slashes of guitar, turning what was a meditative mood piece into something close to a rock song before collapsing into a cloud of noise. Koenigs’ voice appears briefly in the middle, weaving ghostlike over the pulsing sounds. “Class War” is a kaleidoscopic head trip, electronics pinwheeling woozily in the background as Koenigs’ voice drifts like an untethered astronaut in space. According to the album notes, Koenig is joined by Aaron Steinburg on “burner synths and tunnel smoke,” both of which make themselves apparent on the title track, great whooshes of sound encircling ripples of electronics.   is a moody, masterful head trip, another plunge into the dark galaxy of Filthy Huns.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

The label’s recent compilation,  , opens with the track “Bsslama Hbibti” by Fadoul (his name is also credited as Fadaul and Faddoul), and is a gritty, speaker-shaking 7-inch that he and his band first recorded for the Morocco-based Atlassiphone label. That imprint was also home to probably the most rare song on this set, Belbao’s killer version of “Harlem Shuffle,” taken from a test pressing. Back in the ‘60s, Moroccan youth grooved to a different beat, as groups like Les Golden Hands created music akin to English bands like The Shadows and The Beatles. On this compilation, on a song called “Mirza,” the band recreates Nino Ferrer’s classic mod track, giving it a raw, garage-funk aesthetic. Elsewhere on  , singer Kamal Keila uses “Al Asafir” to showcase his voice—a rich, mesmerizing instrument that wafts gently through the melody.

You hear it in his flow—a tattered, sedated delivery that barely rates above a groan—and throughout the lo-fi beats he assembles. Jae’s impressive new EP— is even darker than usual, flipping through several themes in a dense 25 minutes. Performed through Jae’s alter ego, Daffi, the part-vocal, part-instrumental release grapples with anxiety, police brutality, and the inherent dangers of being a young black male in a major city. It’s similar to the hardship Jae dissected on 2012’s   and 2016’s  , but here, his judgement cuts with deep, pinpoint precision. “What’s ISIS when they paying cops for homicide,” Jae quips on “No Chill.” “You vagina behind a badge wit a mustache.” Lines like these come in spurts for Jae, whose tone and cadence resemble that of Mobb Deep’s Prodigy, and lyrics that tend to withdraw into the soundtrack.

The arena-ready artists behind those albums—The Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and Moby—weren’t the only ones giving America a swift kick in the (parachute) pants. Thanks to an upswing of support from festivals, MTV, and magazines (mostly  ,  , and  ), electronica’s underground counterparts were also thriving well into the early ‘00s. This was especially the case in Chicago and its sister city Detroit. While Heathered Pearls may have been too young to witness the Belleville Three’s foundational beats firsthand a decade earlier, the producer/DJ made the most of the Motor City by dancing on its ashes at shipping containers, abandoned warehouses, and gnarly, dimly-lit club nights.

{"album": "Savage Exile", "artist": "Azar Swan", "description": "The duo of Zohra Atash and Joshua Strawn have worked in other joint projects as well as separately over the decade, but their third album as Azar Swan already stands out as one of their strongest efforts to date, refracting the simmering mood music of their earlier into a more unnerving artistic extremism. Starting with the growling, ominous drone loops and rapidly-accelerating pulses of “Shock,” accentuated further by Atash’s murky keen,  , split between compositions by the two musicians, is designed to cause uneasy thrills. Anyone who grew up with the throb of industrial music as part of their DNA will find much that resonates—the track “Jungle Law” especially feels like it should have emerged from a Wax Trax release somewhere in the late ‘80s, or, maybe more appropriately, Zoth Ommog a few years later. But compared to that track’s fairly straightforward approach, what’s especially intriguing about   is the way the duo twists everything to their own particular ends. Pop hooks play as quiet understatement, melodies step aside for murmuring breakdowns, brusque bass loops are offset by lingering tones hovering in the background of the mix. The duo never resort to simple brute anger, either musically or lyrically; instead, there’s a sense of tightly coiled energy that gets tenser and fiercer as it goes. Strawn’s vocals often come across as distant shouts or distorted fragments of threat and fear, but on the verses of “Instinct,” he opts for an intriguing near-croon, a compare/contrast that’s startlingly effective, his own injection of deeply human unease amidst the machinery.

Throughout the album, Stewart hones his acrid sense of humor to a fine point; he spits out the album’s title with palpable malice, letting each icy syllable stand on its own, part mockery, part indictment. The dead-eyed “Vote Cops” comes out as some anarchist read on “Warm Leatherette.” Stewart flatly recites a Western consumerist mantra—“Vote cops/ more shops/ more, more more, more”—interrupted periodically by a tangle of brutally-distorted guitar. The music throughout   only amplifies this grim mood. The guitars throughout are drenched in so much effect they sound like electronics, and the electronics are heat-warped and queasy, a groaning army of seasick robots. There’s no groove or bounce in this music; all of it feels deliberately factory-like (and Factory-like), sheets of bent metal clanging against each other. All of this is deliberate: on   Total Control mimic the mechanical grind of a production line to mirror not only the soullessness of mass production, but also to call attention to the empty-process mindset of those who both create it and benefit from it.   is a satire to be sure, but the jokes often catch in the throat.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

Which means that, for listeners from just about any other region on earth—including much of Scandinavia—Hamferð’s music must communicate more via mood and ambience than it does with their actual lyrics. Nevertheless, it’s clear that the band is, um, deadly serious about the storyline. Given that all six members wear funeral tuxes when the band plays live, Hamferð (written in English as Hamferd) are certainly not above schtick. But their ability to punctuate crushing riffs and tormented death metal growls with airy sections of organ and clean singing gives their music a hymnal quality that adds a ceremonial gravity to its despair, which at times reaches such intense levels of anguish that Hamferð comes off like a goth act in disguise.

Their last album was called   and at the outset of “Physical,” from their latest outing  , Cecilia Gomez sings, “You’re the one I call at night / When it’s too late, and we’re the only ones awake.” Their music suits the mood:   was a collection of hushed, throbbing songs where bubbling layers of electronics were augmented by ringing, slashing guitars, and clattering rhythms.  , by contrast, is leaner and quieter. Most of its 11 songs contain little beyond Gomez’s aching alto and a bed of burbling, minor-key synths. When bandmate Kessiah Gordon’s guitars do appear, they’re so heavily treated they disappear into the electronics. The scaled-down approach suits the subject matter: most of   deals with love, companionship, betrayal, and obsession, all of it expressed in language as bare and minimal as the arrangements surrounding them. All of this would dissolve into an indistinct haze if Gomez and Gordon weren’t such gifted melodic songwriters. Throughout  , they use the pared-down instrumentation as a backdrop for rich, weaving vocal lines. “Brood” scans like a minimalist take on The Knife, with rippling deep-bass synths and Gomez’s voice turning chilling pirouettes on the verses. The two-part “Void” trades electronics for dripping-icicle piano, tracing the outline of a fraught relationship; in the first part, Gomez reckons with a romance in crisis, in the second the damage has deepened and physical contact has become cold and mechanical. Throughout  , Gomez refuses to dress up emotional damage in metaphor—in the synthwave-y “Fortress,” she confesses, “You know I can’t be without you.” But for all of  ’s emotional candor, Gomez never comes across as a victim. Instead, the album plays out like the inner monologue of someone determined to work through loss, refusing to minimize the pain it’s caused, but resolving to find the strength to move forward.", "genre": ["Alternative", "synth pop"]}
{"album": "Spencer for Hire", "artist": "Vic Spencer & Sonny Jim", "description": "J Dilla was often referred to as “your favorite producer’s favorite producer.” While his stature has grown in the years since his tragic death, at the peak of his powers, his combination of grit, precision, emotion, and trunk-rattling bass endeared him to hip-hop heads across the country. Something similar could be said of Vic Spencer, the eternally-hustling Chicago emcee at once celebrated within the underground and criminally overlooked outside of that sphere; he’s your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper. The traits that make Spencer so endearing to technicians of the hip-hop craft are readily apparent on  , a collaboration with rapper SonnyJim. Spencer’s low-register voice moves from self-deprecating (he once anointed himself  ) to braggadocious (“I’m at the Derby in a Porsche,” he raps on “Gs3”) to unflinchingly reflective (“I knew what I had to do but I was afraid / Got off that punk-ass shit / Started recording hit after hit,” goes a line from “Happy Dollars”). It’s Spencer’s versatility as a lyricist that makes his records so irresistibly replayable, and   is no different. His interplay with SonnyJim suggests a lifelong collaboration, not a one-off between two seemingly unconnected emcees. Between   and his fruitful, ongoing collaboration with Chris Crack, it’s clear that Vic Spencer is as comfortable playing off collaborators as he is working on his own. He is your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper, after all—even if your favorite rapper doesn’t know it yet.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap"]}
{"album": "Songs of Praise", "artist": "Shame", "description": "With the exception of the odd veteran act that manages to stay relevant even as their hair goes grey, punk is mostly a genre best served by the young. Case in point: Shame, a group of 19- and 20-year-olds from south London who provide the newest and greatest argument that snarling guitars and nihilistic yelps sound best coming from those barely of legal drinking age. Their debut LP,  , is a non-stop sprint through the darker alleys of post-punk, grunge, hardcore, and even, occasionally, pop. Album opener “Dust On Trial” is ferocious, guitarists Sean Coyle-Smith and Eddie Green circling each other menacingly while singer Charlie Steen deadpans grumbling, sounding like Nick Cave on Xanax. The song’s tense and coiled opening turns out to be a bait-and-switch; the song explodes in its second half, all guts and aggression, the guitar line dive-bombing over and over again, Steen’s voice building to a rancorous snarl. That song is so good that it would be enough if the rest of   simply followed its template, but what makes the album so vital is the scope of sound the group explore. “One Rizla” is a stadium-ready anthem with group vocals, while “Donk,” which clocks in under two minutes, is pummeling, incorporating clanging, Big Black-style riffs and spastic yelps from Steen. The album ends with “Angie,” a track that crystallizes everything Shame does so well. It moves from a quiet, melodic opening section, to a slow, crawling build that wouldn’t sound out of place on an early U2 record. Steen’s voice is decidedly tender, consciously avoiding the growl he spends the previous nine tracks employing. The track’s final half moves into anthemic territory, like an Oasis B-side written during the peak of the band’s powers. It’s unlike anything else on the record, but still suits the band perfectly. This is what makes   such a startlingly strong debut: The band is confident enough to explore different sounds, but never steer too far from the blood and the guts and the grime. Punk may be for the kids, but Shame is for everyone.", "genre": ["Alternative", "post-punk"]}
{"album": "The Miracles of the Seven Dances", "artist": "Hany Mehanna", "description": "You might not expect to find deep funk, psychedelic forays, and exotic futurism on a belly dance album, but back in 1973, Egypt’s  —“The Organ King of Cairo”—was just the type of ambitious young musician to bring it all together. Mehanna, who would become a mainstay of composition and film soundtrack production, and remains involved in the Egyptian music industry to this day, was a huge influence on his country’s music scene.  , equal parts traditional and forward-looking, is regarded as his greatest musical achievement, and a rare gem for vinyl hounds. After digging in the crates for decades, now collectors can scoop up the reissue on the Radio Martiko label. The album opens with “Dala’,” with twisting rhythms that recall both traditional Egyptian music and ‘60s/’70s stateside psychedelia. The track is supported by lurching, rickety percussion laced with bells and tabla (a raw and sample-ready aesthetic that’s revisited, with more strings, on “Raqsah Arabiyah”). It’s followed by “Farha”—Arabic for “joy” or “pleasure”—which pits organic and electronic percussion against playful time signatures and trumpet and flute solos to create a whirling, sensual sound that finds strange stylistic bedfellows in Al Hirt and Dorothy Ashby. But it’s the album’s penultimate track, the minimal showpiece “Tahiya Wal Assaiyah,” that offers the deepest peek into just how powerful an instrumentalist Mehanna was in his early-’70s prime. Built with just drums and keyboard, it nevertheless offers an ever-shifting wall of sound that bears repeated and focused listens.   may find its greatest utility as a collection for belly dancers, but the rest of us should feel lucky to find a portrait of a masterful musician and composer at the height of his powers.", "genre": ["Experimental", "traditional"]}
{"album": "The Optimist", "artist": "Ryan Porter", "description": "Back in 2008, the names Ryan Porter and Kamasi Washington didn’t ring bells with the general public. They performed jazz when the genre wasn’t as popular, seven years before Kendrick Lamar’s avant-rap opus   helped make it trendy again. Two months after that album’s release, Washington—a Lamar collaborator—dropped his own ambitious project, a triple LP called  , on which the saxophonist explored gospel, soul, and funk in a whopping 173 minutes. It was an immediate hit, and in the years since its release, Washington has become the world’s foremost purveyor of big band, spiritual jazz. Yet 10 years ago, he and Porter were simply trying to make it, and the music collected for Porter’s new album— —represents that moment in time.  is Porter’s sophomore LP and a quick follow-up to 2017’s  , where the trombonist turned well-known children’s songs like “Itsy Bitsy Spider,” “Rain Rain Go Away” and “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” into grand orchestral suites. While Porter crafted   with his own kids in mind,   is equally aspirational for different reasons. He conceptualized the album at his apartment in Inglewood, California after hearing Barack Obama’s inauguration speech on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. “I made it a point not to give up on the dreams and goals I’ve set out for myself, and to persevere no matter how hard the obstacles may be,” Porter wrote in a letter that accompanies  . In turn, “Obamanomics” was the first song recorded for this LP, and its anthemic tone captures the widespread euphoria that surrounded the nation’s first black president. Perhaps on purpose, this album is being released during one of the bleakest times in political history to inspire listeners to keep fighting for positivity.  was recorded between 2008 and 2009, at Washington’s parents’ house, in a small basement called “The Shack.” The space was located near the landing strip at Los Angeles International Airport, and every 15 minutes, the sound of incoming planes threatened to disrupt the recording process. The band had to keep all the windows closed, which caused unbearable heat, exacerbated by the Shack’s cramped conditions (the space comfortably holds four people; during the   sessions, eight people squeezed in). “After it was all said and done, The Shack smelled like tube socks and backpack straps,” Porter recalls in the album notes, “but the unity and love we have for each other was evident on every song.” To that end, there’s a strong communal essence to this record. These songs feel like extended jam sessions, and in certain spots—like on the 15-minute “Impressions” and the 17-minute closer “Chocolate Nuisance,” each band member is given ample room to flex their respective chops.   offers a glimpse into the past, well before these artists became synonymous with elite-level jazz.

{"album": "Homowo", "artist": "Basa Basa", "description": "When the Ghanaian sextet   gathered in Nigeria in 1978 to begin work on their third album, the group had already spent the majority of the ‘70s gigging in Ghana’s premiere nightclubs and had witnessed their commercial peak with their 1975 Fela Kuti-co-produced debut. But as the group convened in Lagos’ Decca Studios for several months, they found themselves suddenly exploring a much more modern, thoroughly global sound than they had on their first two records, thanks in large part to their latest collaborator Themba Matebese, a noted Lagos-based South African producer who grew up in London. Matebese added a flurry of synths and keyboards to a sound nevertheless deeply rooted in twin brothers Joe and John Nyaku’s rhythm section, helping Basa Basa make the most lasting, artistically ambitious LP of their career.  is a thrilling, 38-minute mix of Afrobeat, experimental disco, traditional Ghanaian styles, and global pop. Its eight tracks are a mix of instrumentals, English-language dance-floor numbers, and more traditional-leaning numbers sung in a variety of regional dialects like Ewe, Ga, and Hausa. The opening six-minute title track and “African Soul Power,” both driven by a mix of Afrobeat percussion and shockingly modern-sounding synth riffs, serve as centerpieces: both songs walk the line between the Fela Kuti protegee’s traditionalist past and the band’s forward-thinking, diasporic present circa 1978. Translated into English, Basa Basa means  , but the band’s music, honed during their years serving as the house band in Ghana’s legendary Napoleon Club, is often times anything but. Instead, alongside guitarist and lead vocalist Wallace F. Tay, the music of the Nyaku twins’ band is determinedly measured and intricately crafted, from the controlled experimentation on “Black Light” to the dynamic changes and layered riffs on “Love, Love, Love.” Forty years after it was recorded,   sounds more radically ahead of its time than ever.", "genre": []}
{"album": "igot", "artist": "Album of the Day", "description": " is the seventh full-length from  , and there’s still no pinning the guy down. While he’s a well-known artist in his native Spain (who writes his eccentric pop songs in English), Bigott’s albums are as mercurial as the wildly bearded, cartoonish-looking man who makes them. But from his early choral pop adventures to his more recent journeys into Velvet Underground-esque walls of sound, Bigott has remained steadfast in crafting hook-packed songs that—through some magic combination of their author’s formidable pop savvy and the unexpected poetic benefits of writing in his second language—are equal parts funny, cinematic, and moving. Memorable lines abound in the Bigott discography (“Tropical mime / Dancing in the water / Beautiful Marvin Gaye” is one of my personal favorite opening salvos), and his numerous gems (like “The Reno Poem” from   and “Will Anything Happen” from  ) belong in the company of great tunes from more widely recognized outsider artists like Robyn Hitchcock to Bill Callahan. Bigott’s new album,  , is another curve ball. Recorded over two weeks in Los Angeles, it’s a 20-minute jaunt through lo-fi punk and shimmering disco soundscapes with less emphasis on shoegaze-y walls-of-sound than Bigott’s last two offerings. “You can make it fun / You can make it dumb / You can break on through to the other side,” Bigott sings cheerily on the jangle-punk album opener, “Strangers By the Wall.” The loving but tongue-in-cheek nod to rock history is classic Bigott, and the message of unabashed pleasure-seeking is one the songwriter sustains throughout most of the album. The sonic aesthetic, though, takes a few U-turns—most notably on the disco-centric and lighthearted “Don’t Stop the Dance,” a honey-dripped dance track a la Spoon’s “I Turn My Camera On,” and the similarly sparkly “Moving On.” It’s not until   penultimate track that we’re reacquainted with some familiar Bigott sounds. But if the gentle, languishing “Walk In the Hood” is evocative of druggy ’60s Paisley pop, the molasses-slow, album-ending title track is the post-trip hangover. It’s a brutal, gorgeous, and drawn-out tease of a set-ender that only underscores the brevity of the album’s other nine tracks. But then, Bigott covers more ground in these twenty minutes than a lot of artists tackle in their entire careers. If this is your springboard into the visionary and strange world of Bigott, I’m jealous! There’s a ton more candy in store.", "genre": []}

Now, after a decade of DIY touring and records, they’ve become one of the most loved and respected heavy acts in their country, especially thanks to their 2014 release , which attracted hardcore, post-hardcore, screamo, and even metal listeners thanks to its seamless style-melding. On their new album  , Storm{O} are faithful to that same winning formula. Yet, the mathy, metallic brutality that was  ’s core has a fragile and emotional quality here. The result is a powerful, claustrophobic album with exceptional songwriting, starting from the opening track “Taxidermia,” so carefully built on a series of asphyxiating crescendos abruptly interrupted by tense guitar riffs. “Meteorite” evokes the feeling of being powerlessly sucked into a vortex of raving chord progressions and wild accelerations, while tracks like “Porta dell’Attimo” or “Cenere” are excellent examples of fierce, straightforward hardcore. On the rest of the record, the four-piece rarely allow the listener a moment of pause. Singer Luca Rocco sounds like he’s desperately climbing over slippery walls, trying to escape from a nightmare filled with memories and obsessions. His vocals fluently stumble and slide over cutting guitars that continuously swirl and crumple up, crushed by the ever-changing, thumping drums.

Victor Assis Brasil, a Brazilian saxophone prodigy who studied at Berklee College of Music, was clearly soaking up a ton of American and international music when he recorded   with a slate of gifted Brazilian players in 1970, a week before his 25th birthday. From the opening cymbal crash of Jimmy Heath’s “Gingerbread Boy,” the album’s sole cover, it’s clear we’re in for a wild ride. This is blistering, inventive jazz that feels more influenced by Coltrane’s pioneering work a decade earlier—and perhaps by 1960s psychedelic rock—than it does by Jobim’s uber-cool and mellow CTI output of the same era. There’s a dose of rock-ish fury on “Quarenta Graus A Sombra,” where Brasil’s runs take on a chaotic edge, a la Eric Dolphy (who, like Brasil, died unexpectedly in his mid-30s). But it’s not just Brasil and company’s calculated abandon that impresses on  ; three of the LP’s five tracks find him in a mellow mood. And, of course Brasil   influenced by Jobim; he recorded a four-track tribute to the great in the same session, reissued last year by Far Out Recordings, the same label responsible for this release. But even the slower songs feel unique. “Ao Amigo Quartin,” written for Brasil’s label head and friend Roberto Quartin, contains the lovely and intricate acoustic guitar flourishes (courtesy of Hélio Delmiro) that one might expect from a South American jazz ballad, but Brasil’s mournful caterwauls on the track call to mind gospel- and blues-entrenched solos of North American players like John Handy and Booker Ervin. There’s an immensely gifted band at work here, but the LP’s depth and emotion are what make it a true gift. Jazz fans know all too well about would-be giants who died too young.

{"album": "How to Socialise & Make Friends", "artist": "Camp Cope", "description": "Camp Cope’s 2016 self-titled debut was one of those records that crept up quietly and hovered in the background. Their follow-up,   however, stands front and center: it delivers a powerful dose of catchy indiepop riffs and the incredibly dynamic voice of lead singer Georgia Maq. The Melbourne trio, rounded out by Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich and Sarah Thompson, belong in the genre of ultra-polished lo-fi, the vocals pressed so close to the glass edges of the song that the singer’s face is practically right in your ear. This is a good thing. Camp Cope is a female-fronted rock band who unapologetically sing about dismantling the patriarchy of the male-dominated music industry. This is not a timid list of grievances; it’s a funny and devastating testament to the fact that Camp Cope can beat the boys at their own game. “The Opener” is a withering stare in the direction of men claiming they didn’t have time to include more women on the festival bill. The lyrics are a witty screed against rampant sexism and exclusion as Maq sings, “It’s another all-male tour preaching equality / It’s another man telling us we can’t fill up the room / It’s another man telling us to book a smaller venue.” (Camp Cope seem to be quite adept at filling the room, thank you very much.) Maq then mocks the hypocrisy of men by imitating them: “Nah, hey girls, we’re only thinking about you.” But   is not just about the misogyny in the music industry, it’s about the emotional imbalance within male and female relationships. Simplistic chord progressions are comfortingly familiar (yes, Pavement tapes made their way to Australia) as the record drifts from uptempo punk to ‘90s jangle to emo basslines—but it’s Maq’s Lucinda Williams-like drawl that sets this band apart. Even though they sing about injustice and being generally fed up with the male species, Camp Cope play like they’re having the time of their lives.

Though he’d been making music for years,   was his first album for visionary London label Ninja Tune, and was also the first one to feature collaborations with other artists.

The song eventually dissolves into a finale full of sharp clicks and tape fuzz, all sound eventually drowning in a sea of echo. For  , Fake abandoned his previous production methods, which were purely computer-based, opting here to employ old Marantz tape decks, a Roland Jupiter-6 vintage synth, and a broken Akai drum machine, giving the songs an aged, slightly rickety feel. But if the EP opens in darkness, it ends on an emotional high. “Cloudswept” has a driving dance beat and a dense, twisty, high-end synth line; it sounds destined for afterparty sets, with rippling, joyous notes bound to hit all the brain’s pleasure centers. “Lea” ends the EP with a journey into sci-fi minimalism, bubbling major-key monosynth lines floating up like the oil in a lava lamp. And while there are moments on  that feel like a radical departure from Fake’s previous work, it also signals a deeper understanding of the ways to convey complex feeling into instrumental music.   is an album of controlled chaos; perfectly disjointed, raw songs that demonstrate Fake’s growth and newfound confidence.   is Fake in fearless mode, with minimal post-production and a youthful energy few of his contemporaries can match.", "genre": ["Electronic"]}

{"album": "Quare Groov", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "  “Dance was a lonely place in Ireland back then,” says Con O’Laoghaire, singer and percussionist of the group Natural Wild, recalling the difficulty of trying to play funk in Dublin in the mid 1980s. His statement would have made a good subtitle for  , a new compilation of Irish rare groove, punk-funk, and electro put together by the collector and archivist John Byrne, and released by Dublin’s All City label. The comp captures a moment when bands with an interest in cutting rugs were boldly going it alone, juggling wide-ranging inspirations—silky New York disco, jarring No Wave skronk, dubbed-out drum-machine experiments—in relative isolation. “Quare” is an Irish variant of “queer,” or “odd,” though in Northern Ireland, it also has the additional meaning of “remarkable” or “excellent”; both definitions could easily apply here, in varying proportions. On the latter side, there are songs like the Pumphouse Gang’s “Welcome Back Into My Life,” a gorgeous slice of mid-tempo disco from 1979. The lone hit generated when half of the Scottish soul-funk group Cado Belle merged with Dublin’s Stagalee, it’s a slinky, starry-eyed love song that wouldn’t sound out of place being remixed by Masters at Work; there’s almost something uncanny about how American it sounds, in fact. Sunshine’s “Give It to Me” is a similarly faithful take on late-night disco. The Belfast group cut its teeth on the “showband” circuit, playing cover versions in community halls up and down the country, but its devotion to Chic yielded this airy original that effortlessly holds its own. Also falling squarely in the “excellent” column is Natural Wild’s own “Hot & Sexable (Mega Mix),” a jangly funk number in the vein of Shriekback, marked by slap bass, talking drums, and a chilly, dubbed-out ‘80s feel. The real heart of the comp, though, lies in its outliers. Those Nervous Animals’ “Hyperspace!,” from 1985, is a shuddering new wave jam with an intriguing mix of spiky rhythms, shouted vocals, and sophistipop breakdowns. Some of its sparkling high fidelity is the result of the Fairlight CMI sampling synthesizer, at the time still a rare—and staggeringly expensive—instrument. Stano’s “White Fields (In Isis),” a slow-motion electronic brooder, is another technological pioneer: It’s deemed the first Irish recording to make an extensive use of Roland’s TR-808 drum machine—an extension of Stano’s interest in using the studio as his instrument, an idea almost unheard of at the time. Barry Warner’s 1985 single “Losing Control,” meanwhile, is considered Ireland’s first-ever electro track. Repurposing a cassette-only song he had recorded as Ultimate Treason, Warner dropped the vocals and synth melodies, then added delay effects and vinyl scratching. A shuddering mix of 808 beats and cut-up synths, it’s obviously influenced by the era’s breakdancing sounds, but what makes it so exciting is that Warner is so clearly way out in left field, following his own quare muse.", "genre": ["Electronic", "dance"]}

On “Sizzling Highs,” the band recall Tangerine Dream and Cluster laying down a pulsing, futuristic undercarriage that’s blanketed with soaring keyboard runs. On the almost aggressive “Geistesblitz,” sharp wails cut repeatedly through the meditative rhythms and melodies, as the song lends its way to a dissonant climax. And throughout the anthology as a whole, the gauzily lo-fi production only enhances the sense that the Nightcrawlers were gradually detaching themselves from their Philadelphian environment. Given the urban decay that had gripped the City of Brotherly Love in the ’80s, their desire to escape is understandable. Yet it’s arguable that without such despair, they would’ve never had the desire to create music that ventured so fruitfully into inner space.", "genre": ["Electronic", "synthwave", "avant-garde"]}
{"album": "J​-​Jazz: Deep Modern Jazz from Japan 1969​-​1984", "artist": "Various Artists", "description": "Consider jazz in the 1970s, and the years surrounding the decade. Ideas about harmonic openness, electric instruments, funk, samba, and the entire career of John Coltrane had now thoroughly infused the mainstream. That, and the ongoing concerns of black people in the United States, helped to foster a subset of sounds now loosely lumped under the umbrella of “cosmic” or “ecstatic” or, occasionally, “spiritual” jazz. This music was often energetic and aspirational, giving the impression of great possibility within lax, permeable limits. No wonder it’s having a moment again. A new compilation called   portrays that extended decade in a country where, in the wake of post-World War II American occupation, the jazz community grew enormously. In particular,   highlights independent releases never before issued outside Japan, mostly by artists who haven’t seen much international attention. There’s plenty of aggression at the start (saxophonist Koichi Matsukaze’s astringent “Earth Mother”) and finish (guitarist Kiyoshi Sugimoto’s uptempo “Long Neal”) and in between (saxophonist Takao Uematsu’s “White Fire,” kin to something like Freddie Hubbard on  ). There’s some debt to the piano textures of McCoy Tyner (pianist Tohru Aizawa’s “Dead Letter” and the Shintaro Quintet’s “A Blind Man”), two differing but convincing Brazilian-influenced numbers (bassist Eiji Nakayama’s “Aya’s Samba” and drummer Mitsuaki Katayama’s “Unknown Point”) and, curiously, no fewer than four waltz or 6/8 grooves (like the delightfully lilting “Kaze,” from drummer Takeo Moriyama). The highest-profile bandleader here, trumpeter Terumasa Hino, is featured through a 1970 collaboration with the American bassist Reggie Workman in a 15-minute one-chord jam not far removed from the plugged-in sounds, extended technique, and various fusions of 1970s New York. There’s nothing that is consciously folk-fusion about their work—no koto or shakuhachi, for instance. It is a bit of a misnomer to call it  , since plenty of pedal-point structures, ostinato vamps, electric piano, and booming bass amplification date these recordings. Yet it’s so consistently satisfying as to convince anyone that the well is indeed   than we might have imagined.", "genre": ["Jazz"]}
{"album": "Adrian Younge Presents: Voices of Gemma", "artist": "Adrian Younge", "description": " is a prolific composer whose brassy, ‘70s-centric arrangements recall the work of soul music legends Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield, and often emulate the soundtracks of blaxploitation movies like   and  . He’s also a willing collaborator who’s produced music for everyone from Ghostface Killah and the Delfonics to Bilal and PRhyme. Younge’s music was also featured in popular Netflix series   and the 2009 film  , a comedy classic starring actor Michael Jai White. Though Younge is clearly the primary voice behind all of his work, he tweaks his sound to suit each artist he pulls into his orbit. For his new album,  , the composer works with two vocalists—opera singer Brooke deRosa and jazz singer Rebecca Englehart—and builds an unrelenting mix of funk, R&B, jazz, and folk, all refracted through a kaleidoscopic, psychedelic lens. Album opener “Stranger by the Sea” warms up with off-kilter guitar strums and rising vocals that sound like they’re trying to conjure a spirit, before a loose drum beat is joined by a meandering bassline. Elsewhere, on the extravagant “Heaven’s Found,” aggressive drum rolls, oscillating horns, and rumbling bass combine for a lush gem set somewhere in the 1950s. DeRosa and Englehart are the clear focus of the LP, with Younge’s instrumentation floating alongside their beautiful voices. In deRosa and Englehart, he’s found two immensely talented singers who give a shining resonance to his work, making   an essential part of Younge’s already vast discography.", "genre": ["R&B/Soul"]}

The group—made up of Kiki and GG Van Newtown, who are married, and drummer Jason Erskine—blend punk, folk, rock, and classical music to create something powerful and enchanting. It’s also an album of extremes: The anthemic vocals in “Gardener’s Prayer” call to mind Black Sabbath, while “Sight Beyond The Line” has the melodic brightness of The Cranberries, and “Billboard”’s slowly-circling vocals and taut nets of guitar could have been plucked from an early Lush album. But while   is sometimes foreboding and other times energetic, it is consistently mystical. On “It Begins With A Man,” feminist anger is delivered via ghostly, strikingly soft vocals. Supported by a simple but unyielding bassline, its chorus speaks of a change led by sacred feminine knowledge and sisterly bonds: “He doesn’t know about our plan / A thread connecting us through time / Handed down from sisters past.” It’s hypnotic and entrancing. Throughout the album’s eight tracks, Kiki’s vocals swing from celestial to defiant, winding ominous melodies over heavy riffs. Lyrically, Hex encourage engagement with the spiritual, channeling it to create a force for good. On “The Moon,” the Van Newtowns chant: “I see you / I see the moon / Both reflectors of energy / But we’re in an original position / We are a battery of complex construction.” The title track brings the album to a solemn close. The final lyrics present a promising, united future—a continuation of the ideas offered throughout the album: “Around the central golden door / We rise together like a tower / Where we unfold like a flower / She takes your hand and I take yours.” With   Hex step out of the shadows, and suggest that the mystical world still has an important role in navigating life, love, and conflict.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

With March’s  , he’s firmly planted on the latter, beneath a fine umbrella. At least temporarily shelving the Secret Circuit name, Ruscha is exploring rhythm and tone as E Ruscha V and delivering an escape kit full of delicate electroacoustic exotics. From the placid Bibio-esque Hawaiian coo of opener “The Hostess” to the buoyant calypso-dancehall hybrid of the title track, Ruscha finds a balance between meandering ambient gestures and exhilarating melodic refrains. Using clean guitar arrangements and his Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer, Ruscha’s work is inherently coastal, tropical, and considerably more terrestrial than his former outings as Secret Circuit. The gentle chants and hand drums of the concluding track, “All of a Sudden,” defy the dread and despair of our times and aim straight for a point of joy in paradise. If the luxury and detachment of a faraway beach vacation is immaterial,  might be the next best thing.", "genre": ["Electronic", "atmospheric"]}
{"album": "Code Girl", "artist": "Mary Halvorson", "description": "One of the numerous ways guitarist   has distinguished herself over the last decade or so is by regularly developing new projects to explore different facets of her wide-ranging interests; she lists 10 working projects on her website, and most of them pursue wildly different goals.   is the terrific debut from what might be her most ambitious band, a quintet for which she not only wrote music, but also lyrics. The core of the ensemble—bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Tomas Fujiwara—work with her in the long-running collective  . That agile rhythm section comfortably accommodates her new partners, singer  , who also leads the fascinating group Elder Ones on an exploration of free jazz and Carnatic music, and trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, a master who increasingly subverts his deep post-bop roots with ambitious compositional and conceptual conceits. As with many of Halvorson’s bands, the music is marked by fluid contortions and tart harmonies, and the arrangements employ both zigzagging unison lines and rich counterpoint. The performances are rooted in jazz, even if the rhythmic figures sometimes reflect her admiration for art rock,    . Kidambi’s singing ranges widely, sometimes articulating melodies with unfussy directness, sometimes engaging in improvisatory swoops and curlicues. Halvorson’s poetic lyrics are rich in imagery and, as the album title suggests, coded meaning, and their seductive elusiveness provides plenty of food for thought. But the greatest pleasure comes from the way Kidambi’s voice and the playing of Halvorson and Akinmusire dig into the sensual crags, slaloming grooves, and beautifully knotted lyric tangles of the music. This is an album that touches upon various musical traditions in oblique fashion, but it’s most recognizable as yet another major step in Halvorson’s meteoric ascent.", "genre": ["Jazz", "free jazz"]}
{"album": "Run Deep", "artist": "Deva Mahal", "description": "Deva Mahal’s latest album ends with a song called “Take a Giant Step,” which was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and covered by a host of artists over the years—including her father, blues giant Taj Mahal. But rather than sticking faithfully to any previous iterations of the song, Mahal takes the title as an instruction, using the track to demonstrate her formidable pop skills. It opens with a jazzy guitar progression before Mahal locks into a tight duet with a subtle organ line. Her vocals on the song are breathtaking, and her take on “Giant Step” is inspirational without ever becoming saccharine, with an invigorating guitar solo that kicks open the door into a final, triumphant chorus. That ease and skill shows up throughout  : instrumental interludes become vibrant plays on old spirituals; jazz chords get tangled up in funk grooves and soaring vocal melodies, and downcast ballads become anthems of power thanks to Mahal’s commanding vocals.  is awash in gorgeous vocals, inventive instrumentals, and has a distinct feel for exploring the more interesting crevices of pop music. “Can’t Call it Love” opens with a crunching guitar riff as Mahal sings, “I’m feeling new like an old-school instrumental / I’m getting in the mood / And feeling sentimental.” There’s a deliberate assertiveness to that lyric, subtly underscoring Mahal’s confidence in her own talent, and her ability to bend familiar styles into something new. Transformation is a theme throughout   On “Dream,” over moody, wavy guitar lines, Mahal laments a lost love, but also expresses the joy that comes from moving on. “Optimist” bolsters a ripping organ riff with live hip-hop drums and a group of background vocalists who echo every word Mahal sings; it’s a tour de force. “It’s Down To You” takes a thick, atmospheric guitar line and pairs it with a wraith-like organ to accent Mahal’s defiant lyrics: “I won’t be the only one to lay my life on the line,” she tells an unnamed lover. is full of affirmations like this, that Mahal is—and all of us are—strong enough to do what we’re afraid of. It’s easy for that idea to read as overly sentimental, but the album is full of such passion, belief, and beauty that Mahal never feels anything less that wholly convincing. On “Dream,” she sings of being able to “tell the truth from the make-believe.” On  , she separates fact from fiction again and again, and delivers truth with inspiring conviction.", "genre": ["Pop", "Soul"]}
{"album": "Net", "artist": "Sandra Bell", "description": "Though she had recorded and released a fair amount of material by the time it was released, Sandra Bell hit her creative stride with her 1991 release of  , a collection of agonized art rock, released in her home country of New Zealand on the experimental-leaning label Xpressway Records. In addition to playing numerous shows around the world, including her first gigs in the U.S., Bell was writing songs at a steady clip, producing strong work that expanded on her tightly-coiled sound with elements of traditional folk music and an increased level of tension. Much of the output from this especially fertile period of Bell’s career has been collected in this double-LP set from Drawing Room records, which consists of nearly everything she released in 1995: her second full-length album,   along with the material from two 7” singles (the  EP and “Angel”/“ ”). Bell expresses herself primarily with scraggly guitar chords, which are either overdriven with distortion or dusted by a phase shifter. It’s psychedelic but grounded, like a microdose that sharpens the senses and makes colors a little more vivid. The spell is broken only by dramatic shifts in volume and tone. “History” shimmers blithely before a blast of “Sister Ray”-like guitar lightning. And the marvelous “Caitlan” strips everything down to an indelicate piano line and the groans and scrapes of a cello. These are songs of restlessness, a mood amplified by Bell’s use of language. Like Life Without Buildings frontwoman Sue Tompkins, she gets stuck on one turn of phrase or sentence, repeating it multiple times with the emphasis landing in different places. The lyrics speak of constant movement (by foot or by car), spiritual unrest, and an inability to meet another person’s gaze. Bell’s only solace seems to come by spilling these words and ideas out in gentle gushes as she steadies herself against the swirl and jangle of the music.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}

Anchored by Alaska B’s cavernous drums, “Dark Water” and “Yandere” showcase Yamantaka//Sonic Titan at their heaviest, while the entire album references both indigenous creation myths and Tibetan Buddhist themes of death and rebirth.

A few names come to mind immediately: Kamasi Washington in Los Angeles, Nat Birchall in Manchester, and, in London, the four-piece Ill Considered. The group released their self-titled debut in September of last year, and followed with a live album, recorded at the Crypt of St. Giles Church in South London. Born in the same Hoxa HQ Studio in Hampstead as their first LP,   also shares that record’s fondness for improvisation. This wasn’t part of the plan; the band initially intended to record music they’d written beforehand, but soon realized upon entering Hoxa for the second time that their power lay in spontaneity and musical freedom. The LP opens with “Djinn,” a meditative piece of mystical jazz where Leon Brichard’s simple, repeated bass motif and Satin Singh’s evocative percussion create space for Idris Rahman’s soaring saxophone. “Nada Brahma,” full of atmosphere and suggestion, also takes repetition as its starting point. There are touches of Indonesian gamelan in Brichard’s bass harmonics before Rahman’s sax and Emre Ramazanoglu’s drums explore more abstract terrain. The transitions between quiet, meditative passages and head-nodding energetic peaks is even more evident on “Delusion,” a monstrous slab of drum-&-bass-meets-jazz-fusion that lands the quartet somewhere between ‘90s Photek and  -era Miles Davis. On that song, they transmit punk jazz energy similar to their U.K. contemporaries Comet is Coming and Sons of Kemet.

{"album": "You Fucken Sucker", "artist": "Paul de Jong", "description": "Run a quick internet search for Paul de Jong’s name, and one word pops up again and again in reference to his music: “genreless.” That description has been appended to his output since his time in The Books, the celebrated collage-pop duo he co-founded with Nick Zammuto, and their breakthrough album,  which featured a sublime combination of found sounds, samples pulled from old records (guitar, piano, and cello melodies), and glitchy vocals that pulled as much from experimental electronic music as they did from Americana. After the band broke up in the late ‘00s, de Jong made his solo debut in 2015 with  a record that could be considered a continuation of The Books’ sound. It showcased de Jong doing what he knows best, pulling samples from his meticulously curated record collection, and adding a joyous mixture of pop, jazz, and sounds made with everyday household items. It was a wondrous record with an uncanny joie de vivre that’s hard to describe. His new album,  is a completely different affair. Gone is the sense of amazement and curiosity that distinguished  replaced by raw, slightly unhinged, and complex experimental tracks that focus less on melody and more on translating feelings like loss, grief, doubt, anger, frustration, and confusion into sound. It’s telling that de Jong begins the journey with “Embowelment,” a track with a backbone of a chorus of voices screaming in rage—sometimes looped in reverse—atop syncopated drumming, acoustic guitar melodies, and synths. It’s an overwhelming composition that functions as a harbinger of the emotional purging to come. Arranged into a sequence,  ’s 14 tracks tell vivid tales of modern anxieties: the need for success, the viscerality of heartbreak, the inevitability of disappointment. (The dogmatic positivity in the spoken word passages of “Doings,” “Dimples,” “Almost Doomed,” and “Doomed” wryly underscore the album’s main thrust.) There are moments of respite—like “Pipe Dream,” a rare quiet track full of blips and tones—but they don’t last long. The record ends with the violence of “Breaking Up,” a track that recalls the screaming chorus of “Embowelment,” with its fury laser-focused on a cheating lover. Balanced atop a plucking, tuneless guitar, the track quickly devolves into instability. is de Jong in an even more fearless form, with nothing to lose but darkness, anger, and despair.

{"album": "Sex & Food", "artist": "Unknown Mortal Orchestra", "description": "You never know quite what you’ll get from Unknown Mortal Orchestra: The Portland-via-New Zealand band has dabbled in lo-fi indie pop, psychedelia, and eclectic soul on their three previous albums. On their latest LP,  , they roll up all three into a weird-ass package that also includes jazz-rock, lite funk, and bits of proggy folk. If there’s a through-line here, it’s the guitar: so viscous and heavily manipulated that it’s tough to distinguish from the electric piano that’s often played alongside it. When coupled with singer Ruban Nielson’s delicate vocals, these songs feel woozy and provocative. Take “Ministry of Alienation,” where Nielson’s voice evokes a deep state of calm, until a whirring synthesizer and skronking sax bring the song to an abrupt close. A grainy, overdriven version of that same lubricious guitar sound is the foundation for “American Guilt,” a rugged stoner rock jam with witchy, pinched vocals that sound at once mocking and weary. “Hunnybee” pushes to the edge of yacht rock cheese, and not just because of the spelling: the bright, rubbery guitar slips and slides around electric key chords and tightly compressed bass; it’s basically the sonic version of a hairy chest in an unbuttoned wide-collar shirt in, say, 1978. There’s more happening here than anachronistic rock poses, though.   showcases the band’s considerable versatility: the fingerpicked acoustic guitar and multi-tracked vocals sound as assured on the stripped-down “Chronos Feasts on His Children” (an opaque reference to a Greek myth regarding the passage of time) as the lush mix of guitars and keyboards on “How Many Zeros,” or the noisy and sprawling psych workout “Major League Chemicals.” On  , Unknown Mortal Orchestra switch musical approaches so effectively that there’s no predicting where they’ll go from one song to the next.

Although Vessey is himself a prominent producer, having worked with artists including Danny Brown, Slum Village, and Quelle Chris (his partner in Crown Nation), here he largely hands over the keys to two A-list stars: Knxwledge and Odd Future rapper Earl Sweatshirt. The pair have crafted a cocktail of humid tracks that generally eschew anything resembling a hook in favor of free-from horns, synths, and thudding, murky percussion. It’s the perfect backdrop for Vessey’s bizarre and mesmerizing vocal riffs and patterns, which he pulls off—perhaps here more than ever before—with an air of effortlessness. Although he has already established himself as a torchbearer for the mad hatter MF Doom and a contemporary of the politically-minded Open Mike Eagle, on songs like the title track, he approaches Kendrick Lamar’s nimble, rapid-fire delivery.

Later, her guitar solo in “Lifer” gushes to life unexpectedly, like a tidal wave. These captivating, unsettling details serve to reinforce Wasner’s sharp portraits of malaise and self-doubt. “Oh, hard heart, do you know yourself?” she asks on “Symmetry,” echoing the opening line of 2011’s “Civilian”: “I am nothing without pretend.” If the album has a focal point, it’s “It Was Not Natural.” Over a menacing piano line that recalls Radiohead’s “A Punchup at a Wedding,” and an improbably snappy beat, Wasner discovers a treasure, “seemingly foreign, but somehow still it is familiar.” It’s a poignant summation of her unease, but it could just as easily read as the mission statement for a band that continues to evolve.", "genre": ["Alternative", "Pop"]}

Since 2011, when they tracked down vintage Rasta vocal group The Congos in Portmore, Jamaica to make the album that would become , they have built an intimate relationship with the island and its music that puts dilettante appropriators of Jamaican music to shame. The duo have found time to strengthen personal connections across the island over repeated visits—recording vocalists like Fyah Flames, Cerassietea, Lukan I, and many more—making vivid episodic films of their travels and sessions, and finally establishing a studio of their own there. This collaboration, with the British label Bokeh Versions, is the latest fruit of this work: consisting of “80% new” tracks,  pairs vocals from Sikka Rymes, I Jahbar, Early One, Lyrical Wiz, Sniper, Buddy Don, and Lopo with beats from Duppy Gun’s California musical family (D/P/I, Butchy Fuego, Big Flyte & Velkro, and Ras G) with Bokeh’s (Jay Glass Dubs, Seekersinternational, Abu Ama).

{"album": "Sekyra prohnaná kolenem", "artist": "Nikander", "description": "One of the more unique traits of the Czech language, which it shares with other Slavic languages, is a clear predominance of consonants, to the point where vowels occasionally disappear. Words like “vlk” (wolf), “prst” (finger), and “krk” (throat) sound more like guttural cries to an English-language ear. Maybe that’s part of the reason why the Czech language is particularly satisfying in a genre like sludge metal, where charm is often built on the brutality of slimy, jarring sounds. Hailing from the city of Brno, “Czechoslovak” band   (half of them come from Slovakia and the other half from the Czech Republic) are a potent example of the genre. Their debut album  is a collection of powerful, rasping stoner rock riffs shot through with a sense of pure evil. Singer Jana Kremace alternates between lyrics in English and Czech, but always screams with the same demonic intensity. “Observing dust / Mechanically trapped / In pleasant void,” she fiercely spouts over the rhythmic yet rotten guitar riff of “Set a Distant Lie,” and it almost sounds as if she’s describing the sound of her own band. Not only are Nikander great at writing tense tracks built on the repetition of a certain riff or pattern, they also sagely mix epic hellbound rides (“Ve stínu val”) with powerful doom metal flare-ups that sound like they could easily shatter the ground underneath the band to reveal dirt and tar pits (“Steel Willows”), and slower moments dense with an Om-reminiscent atmosphere (“Farewell”).

Moments of personal reflection (“It’s just you and me / And a reshuffled dream / That calls you away again,” Palladino sings on “Trumpets Fade”) are saved from outright sorrow by layers of guitar and reverb, casting the duo in the role of celestial messengers with dirt under their nails. These heavy contrasts are especially evident on “Criminal,” where the song’s heavy use of bass, drums, and vocal reverb evoke the hazier moments of Blonde Redhead. Similarly, the slow build of “To The Depths” allows Palladino’s soprano to transform from vapor to a Victoria Legrand-like growl, before being met—and temporarily absorbed—by heavy guitars and clapping rhythms at the song’s apex. When they do finally air their emotions candidly, the moment feels like a well-earned reveal; on the piano-and-voice closing track “The Distance,” where Palladino declares “I know I didn’t believe you the distance had become the one / Way road of the shooting star into the sun.” Breaking up can be messy and painful, but Palladino and Church seem willing to embrace and cross-examine their changing narrative.", "genre": ["Electronic", "shoegaze"]}

That song also introduces the key to Rawkid’s sound: his ability to effortlessly blend punchlines with heady, stream-of-consciousness bars. His most famous track to date, “Grum 5.0,” is a hilarious breakdown of the intricacies of England’s many grime dialects. “Long John Silver” is a woozy concoction of dizzy synths and grooving drums. “Listen, I’m not shit / I’m the shit / Too many men think they’re in Pearl Harbor / I can’t swim,” he raps, alternating between sly giggles and stone-faced seriousness. On the bluntly-titled “Fuck Your Dreams (Feat. Kyro),” he delivers tough street poetics over triplet-laced hi-hats. “If a man tries to duplicate my shit / I find him / Say no more.” Then, just half a verse later he shows off his skillful wordplay, rapping “Got me blue in the face just like the queen’s face on a five-pound note.” Bristling street threats paired with witty one-liners and laugh-out-loud bars don’t always work in conjunction, but Rawkid has perfectly balanced the equation. Maybe he is the black Einstein after all.", "genre": ["Hip-Hop/Rap", "grime"]}

{"album": "Odd Talk", "artist": "Ganser", "description": "Four years passed between the formation of the Chicago-based band Ganser and the release of their debut LP,  , and the wait has served them well. Led by bassist and vocalist Alicia Gaines, the group effortlessly merge the unrelenting pulse of angular post-punk with the layering techniques (if not the exact sound) of shoegaze. Charlie Landsman’s guitar lines are almost freeform, bouncing and careening off the walls of the song. This interplay between the propulsive, steady foundation of Gaines and drummer Brian Cundiff’s rhythm section and Landsman’s unpredictable but precise playing give the band a feeling of both meticulous control and wild spontaneity. Swinging from skittish new wave to marauding punk and hitting almost every stop in between,   pushes out every genre it touches in novel ways, and Gaines’s severe delivery gives every song a goth-like edge, shrouding the entire affair in darkness. On “Satsuma,” an interlocking drum and bass rhythm joins up with an army of guitar lines, creating a mountaintop of sound from which Gaines yells, “What a time to be alive!” The sentiment doesn’t scan as enthusiastic leap so much as a deadpan eye-roll. Gaines deploys sarcasm with skill throughout  , managing to be cutting without ever getting too acidic; she’s not out to burn down the world, she’s out to bring it back to life. On “Aubergine,” Cundiff’s massive, post-rock drums clear the way for a wail of feedback and a melancholy keyboard line from Nadia Garofalo. Gaines’s voice is elastic and free-roaming, stretching out syllables for whole bars. When Landsman’s guitars enter, they sound detuned and melted, groaning and heaving. On that song, and on   as a whole, the group turns the otherwise grotesque into something haunting and beautiful. Very goth, indeed.", "genre": ["Alternative", "post-rock"]}

But despite her statement to the contrary, the clues scattered throughout her gothic club songs on   suggest that she is, indeed, working with some heavy concepts. Operating in a similar terrain as Arca (another artist preoccupied with biomorphic forms and digital alchemy), Devi stretches the tropes of dance music—icy trance stabs, seismic 808 kicks, percussive cycles of tension and release—into shapes that dangle on the edge of total dissolution. Instead of basslines, she deals in vast, gelatinous sheets of buzz; instead of beats, there are concussive blasts trailing long, glassy reverb tails. She can be disarmingly sweet: “Intentional Dreams” is a weightless ballad in which pitch-shifted, harmonized voices are smeared like iridescent gel; in “Genesis of Ohm,” rubbery arpeggios and eerily-processed vocals recall the Knife’s 2006 album  . In the world of  , flesh and silicon are inextricably intertwined. The key to the whole thing is “Time (Tool),” a hair-raising spoken word interlude that appears toward the end of the LP. Devi’s voice—which, in an unusual twist on the uncanny valley, sounds like a human imitating a computer-generated voice—has the eerie, commanding calm of an airport advisory. “If you name me, you negate me,” she begins, “I am the zero point, the primal vibration / The one and only / I am the mirror and you are me.” Her monologue is run through claustrophobic slap-back reverb, and the way she unspools a tale of space and eternity is both hypnotic and disorienting. “Hear the tone,” she commands. “Arise aware / You will recognize time as the illusion of solidity / You’ll be the last poet, the truth seeker, the DNA of immortality / You’ll unravel your ghostly matter, have visions of alchemy / You will smile when you die / You will not name me / I am the prophet and you are me.” And with that, Devi slips us into a long, twisting tunnel of distended wails and disembodied voices. Whatever humanity’s eventual merger with the digital might end up looking like,   feels like an unnervingly accurate approximation.

Menacing distortion on his guitar, false starts and unexpected hiccups in his compositions, a touring drummer that often sounds like he’s just strolled in from  —all of these surprises add an edge to his songs that steer him clear of the tropes of standard indie-folk fare. The new Shakey Graves record   is Rose-Garcia’s biggest curveball yet. He has largely moved his gnarled guitar figures to the back of the mix (and in some cases, done away with them entirely), opting instead to welcome a wide range of pop-influenced stylings into his arrangements (“I could only deny the inevitable for so long,” he has quipped about his newfound interest in the Beatles and Harry Nilsson). As a result,   radiates a technicolor glow throughout. “Dining Alone” boasts a giddy chorus that nails Olivia Tremor Control’s penchant for polished melody; later, “Mansion Door” shines with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young harmonies and “Climb on the Cross” effortlessly evokes contemporary psych-pop acts like Foxygen with its humid production and retro synths. Intriguingly, Rose-Garcia uses these backdrops to deliver some of his most somber and topical commentary yet. Threaded through the album are nods to contemporary populism (“Pinch every penny and stroll to the bank / Beg for a loan on my humble estate,” he sings on “Excuses”), the sad realities of aging (“Tin Man”), and even a sharp critique of Islamophobia on “My Neighbor.” Shakey Graves has always frayed the edges of folk music, but on  , Rose-Garcia rips them up entirely, and reaps the rewards.", "genre": ["Alternative", "Folk"]}

On his fifth album  , Ladder and his backing band the Dreamlanders deliver songs that are one part dark cabaret and one part roadhouse band, well-suited to Ladder’s melancholy crooning. The result is music that’s theatrical, but never melodramatic. The band—which features Kirin J Callinan on guitar—kick into suave mode on the opening “Can’t Stay” and sustain that elegant air throughout. The Dreamlanders may have the kind of taut swing and stomp that feels built for dancing, but on  they capably generate a host of different atmospheres, whether it’s the nervy synth-led “Susan” or the slow burn build “Tell It Like It Is.” Ladder, acting as his own producer, rides through it all with the ease of a seasoned performer (his first full album was released 13 years ago). He knows what works best, for both him and his musicians. Never fully lost in the music, but not roaring over it either, his understated ease lends a narrator’s confidence to his portrayals of people with a desperate nighttime edge about them. There’s a bit of humor too; at the start of “I.N.M,” Ladder deadpans, “Levitation is easy…if you know how to pull some strings.”   is an album of short stories, recounted by an assured, debonair protagonist.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

It would have been hard to predict in advance how things would have turned out: Both acts tend to approach their mostly-electronic compositions playfully, with Wong and Minekawa favoring to regular patterns and cute melodies, and Good Willsmith opting for the abstract, their improvised free-for-alls ping-ponging all over the place, full of delirious mischief. Combined, they could have easily amplified one another’s kookier aspects and ended up with something both overstimulated and overstimulating. Instead, by some miraculous alchemical reaction, each has brought out the vivid beauty in the other. This is, very simply, a gorgeous record. There are some tangible reference points: a motorik krautrock beat underpinning “The Garden of Earthly Flanger”; some freaky vocal processing in “Aiの名” that recalls the post-Arca school of contemporary electronica; a particular interaction between the cymbals and high-frequency synths on “擬感情物語” that feels descended from early ‘90s Underground Resistance and Carl Craig. Here and there, you might hear hints of The Necks’ slo-mo jams, or The Orb at their best and most intergalactic. But more often, you won’t even notice the lineage, because the sound consistently transcends not only influence, but its own immediate sources: you won’t know whether what you’re hearing is organic or electronic, but it hardly matters, because the result is simply blissful.

{"album": "Quieter", "artist": "Carla Bozulich", "description": "Carla Bozulich, in my estimation, has yet to get the canonical appreciation she deserves. Critically adored and certainly renowned among a faithful audience of listeners—many of whom (like myself) have been following her since her days as a member of the industrial group Ethyl Meatplow and the warped alt-country outfit Geraldine Fibbers—she still rarely shows up in regular discussions of some of the most unique and consistent voices to emerge from the ‘90s underground, or of the most talented musicians and arrangers in experimental music today. And her work carries great emotional heft and immediacy, too, in a way that heady experimentation often struggles with; it often seems to come from some raw rift in the heart, full of the ugliness of loss and grief and alienation. Part of this, surely, is that her music ranges wide across a number of styles but bends them all in to a very specific aesthetic—which can often be harsh and confrontational to the ear (especially when she’s playing with her band Evangelista), but does not have any of the pummeling, unrelenting genre conventions of much of the noise scene. She brings in her beloved country music (see her  , with Nels Cline, for this impulse in its purest form), gospel (which, of course, helped birth both country and blues), and sly nods to pop music from the ‘50s through the ‘70s. And though she has such a firm sense of herself and her sonic range, she’s never afraid to explore new territory or to collaborate with real equanimity with any number of fellow musicians. Her latest,  —a fairly easily approachable record in the Bozulich oeuvre, as was her last,  —is full of honored guests. John Eichenseer, aka  , contributes to two of the album’s most striking pieces: the opener “Let it Roll” (on which another experimental stalwart,  , plays drums) and “Stained in Grace.” “Let it Roll” is positively spiritual, with duduk and bells conjuring a meditative state that’s both intimate and highly ritualized, as the most meaningful religious services are.   joins in on “Written in Smoke,” creating sharp terrain with caustic guitar work for Bozulich’s dreamy growl to explore. The Night Porter—Bozulich’s group with Shahzad Ismaily, Jessica Catron, and Ches Smith—assembles for “Sha Sha,” a true creepout that stretches, malforms, and grinds up sunny pop idioms with metallic grace. The legendary Marc Ribot co-wrote “End of the World,” which posits that we’ll go out not with a bang or a whimper but a slow, deadly groan; he also appears on “Emilia,” as does cellist  , who co-wrote that beautiful, aching piece. Hopefully, this gorgeous album, which deserves to have time spent with it in the same way all of Bozulich’s work does, will get her one step further to the center of the conversation when it comes to lifetime achievement in the experimental world.", "genre": ["Experimental"]}
{"album": "Mating Surfaces", "artist": "Lithics", "description": ", the sophomore album from post-punk darlings  , showcases the four-piece at the height of their powers. Jagged guitar riffs, dominant basslines, minimal drums, and affectless vocals work together to create a fresh take on classic post-punk (à la Delta 5 or Gang of Four). Newly signed to legendary Pacific Northwest label Kill Rock Stars, on this release the Portland, OR-based band deliver 12 biting, crisp tracks in just under 30 minutes. Vocalist Aubrey Hornor, who also plays guitar, delivers her lyrics with confidence, recalling a more polished Cynthia Sley (of  ). Hornor’s lyrics, filled with Gertrude Stein-esque half-thoughts and repetitions, evoke lonely, fractured scenes: “No place to call your own / When you are all alone,” she sings on “Home.” Although Lithics does dissonant, experimental punk well, some of the best tracks dive into distinctly more melodic territory, particularly on the latter half of the album. The sing-song vocals and dueling guitar lines of “Edible Door” bring to mind   in their  era. This sonic shift may signal more of what the band has been striving for. In an interview last year, bassist Bob Desaulniers said he considered their efforts to be more pop-oriented these days. “I’d rather be a kind of harsh pop band than trying to be some badass punk band and not really succeeding at that,”   in an interview with Portland alt-weekly  .

Their latest album,  , is Beach House at their most restless, exploring new musical terrain while remaining rooted in their core sound. It’s not a sleight to say that the most exciting songs on   distantly resemble older Beach House songs. On lead single “Lemon Glow,” the duo pushes the arena-leaning anthemics of  ’s “Wishes” into a deep groove, maybe the first straight-up  in the band’s catalog. The spastic, jittering synths that introduce “Drunk in LA” sound ripped from a Neon Indian song, but  ’s eerie sense of sorrow manifests itself in Legrand’s slowly unfurling vocals and abstract, devastating lyrics. Scally’s use of acoustic guitar on “Lose Your Smile” is unprecedented in Beach House’s catalog, but the wail of a slide guitar on the song’s outro recalls the intro of debut single “Apple Orchard.” “L’Inconnue” is partially sung in French, and it’s one of two tracks to boast a mid-song tempo change, but its organ-led, bleak ambience would feel at home on  . Lyrically,  mostly sticks to the group’s established topics: the darker parts of the human mind, the desolate undercurrents of romance. On   Legrand leans into the lyrical abstractions that have guided her since  ; through her words, she pushes Beach House even further in the metaphysical direction toward which it’s been heading.

{"album": "I Have Fought Against I", "artist": "The Body", "description": "Portland-based extreme metal duo   have released a dozen albums since their 2010 breakout,  . Though the band’s sound is easily recognizable, each subsequent release also brings something new to the table, not only because members Chip King and Lee Buford have built their songs more and more around samples and synthesized drums as their project has progressed, but also because they’ve opened their creative doors to countless other musicians. More than half of The Body’s releases are full-on collaborations with other bands—like   and  —and even albums credited to just “The Body” include a plurality of voices beyond King’s and Buford’s. It’s no surprise, then, that the first voice we hear on the group’s latest,  , doesn’t belong to either of the band’s core members but to Assembly of Light Choir’s Chrissy Wolpert, whose elegiac vocal enters near the end of the quiet, fraying first track. It isn’t until track two, “Can Carry No Weight,” that we hear King’s trademark, razor-like wail; when we do, it’s set in the background of the mix, chopped and manipulated under Kristin Hayter of  ’s lead vocal and anchored by a muted four-on-the-floor beat. This interplay is telling: on  , King and Buford take on the role of being contemporary metal’s Sly & Robbie. They focus their energy on rhythm, texture, and structure, sampling their own distinct sound—the booming percussion, in-the-red distortion, King’s voice—such that it becomes a sonic foundation for their collaborators to build upon. This results in frequent, affecting tonal shifts. The first two-thirds of “An Urn” display the duo’s varied toolbox: grinding noise, a synthesized beat, abstract howls, a fleeting, dancehall-ish melody line. Once they set the stage, Hayter comes in, screaming a monologue that, against an stop-start acoustic drumbeat, matches  ’s somber register but adds a personalized sense of urgency.", "genre": ["Metal"]}

Die! DIE! DIEEEEEEE!” Make no mistake; this preemptive bludgeoning qualifies as a rude welcome—but for death metal acolytes, a slaying at the hands of these notorious death-dealers might as well be a big, fat bear hug. There’s certainly more than enough of this “love” to go around on  . A 10-track abomination fashioned from Tampa death metal’s chugging grooves, Bay Area thrash’s anthemic slams, Norwegian black metal’s atmospherics, and New York hardcore’s curb-crushing breakdowns,   stands as Skinless’ strongest, most cohesive effort in years. Stompers like “Skull Session” and “Exacting Revenge” serve up satisfying slabs of the dank red meat fans have come to expect, their preexisting heft rendered all the more fearsome thanks to the cavernous mix of producer Dave Otero (Primitive Man, Cattle Decapitation, Cephalic Carnage).

{"album": "Location", "artist": "The Contemporary Jazz Quintet", "description": "Kenny Cox was watching Miles Davis closely in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. The Detroit pianist was hardly alone, of course—but the first two albums by Cox’s Contemporary Jazz Quintet (released on Blue Note in 1968-69) may have picked up the gauntlet of Davis’s great ‘60s quintet more firmly than any other jazz band of the time. The Quintet’s third album,  , didn’t come until 1973—on Cox’s own Strata Records, its inaugural release—and by that time, Cox had learned the lessons of   and  , too.  reshaped those lessons, however. Bassist Ron Brooks retains his upright acoustic, replacing aggressive funk with a steady thrum that becomes nearly subliminal beneath Cox’s electric piano, trumpeter Charles Moore and saxophonist Leon Henderson’s horns, and Danny Spencer or Bud Spangler’s percussions. The drummers, too, deviate from Davis’s fusion template: They have the longer-distance miking and thudding low-end, but hew closer to conventional swing, even if—as on “Nzugo Saba (Struggle)”—it’s lightning fast. Two tracks, “Tao” and “Inner Beckoning,” come closer than the others to funk, featuring guitarist Ron English, who strongly echoes John McLaughlin. There are throbbing grooves and some electronic processing of trumpet and bass on “Inner Beckoning,” though the track is more hesitant in its pacing. The Quintet abhors clutter—“Tao” keeps to a clean, easy groove, such that even when Spangler builds into a trap-kit frenzy, the others mainly just stay out of his way. The resulting rhythmic and textural approach sometimes hints at Damo Suzuki-era Can, a contemporary of the Quintet, and one whom Cox likely hadn’t then heard. More to the point, though,   is a thoughtful, fascinating example of Cox as a keen observer of the cutting edge, understanding it before most of the world had caught up—and having the confidence to take it his own way.  ", "genre": ["Jazz", "free jazz"]}

Album opener “Degdega” seems to be designed to make your heart beat faster, translating the feeling of unease into sound.

Ben Youssef uses a TR-808 to reimagine the many traditional rhythms and instruments of the Maghreb—an area that spans most of Northern Africa, from Mauritania to Libya—through a sci-fi lens in order to warn the region’s dwellers about an impending bleak future, and to spur them into action. By putting instruments like the gasba flute, the zokra bagpipe, and the guembri guitar through the filters of the iconic 808 and bending these sounds into surprising and often unrecognizable forms, Ben Youssef joins the ranks of artists shedding a light on North African futurism by taking a critical and nuanced look at past traditions and remaking them into something that can serve as a window to the region’s unique heritage for the citizens of a distant future. is a wild, intriguing listen; Ben Youssef uses harsh electronic beats as a canvas to constantly criss-cross styles and sounds that don’t typically occupy the same space. Desert blues rhythms coexist with hard rave beats, Algerian raï, targ music from the Bargou valley in Tunisia, and Moroccan gnawa, creating a sound that’s as raucous as it is alluring and illuminating. The standout track “Layli” is a testament as to how all these influences work together. Beginning with a distorted guitar riff, it quickly evolves into an upbeat banger, with hand percussion and distant chiptune blips accompanying renowned Moroccan guembri player and singer Mehdi Nassouli’s game of call and response with the backing choir. After a dizzying break, the track turns into a gabber-influenced banger with an undeniably youthful energy. These juxtapositions between toughness and playfulness run throughout the record with a track like “Ichki Lel Bey” featuring chiptune breaks, and another like “Boganga and Sandia” featuring a beautiful guembri melody looped and layered on top of a resounding bass.

It’s audible from the start, with the lead-off track “Heaven Knows” smartly showcasing nearly all the group’s core qualities. Fortune’s vivid, strong voice matches instantly memorable music that combines pop catchiness with dark undertones, squealing and shattered guitar riffs with tense, powerful drumming. The following track, “Too Late,” soars like something out of the Psychedelic Furs catalog; while its lyrics speak of loss, the song itself pushes forward relentlessly, mirroring the album’s spirit of determination. “Belong,” built around a bass riff by Travers and fleshed out by the band, has the nerviness of a prime Cure single, a tangle of guitars tripping across a locomotive bassline.

The album was full of colorful lyrics about rebelling against the 9-to-5, staying home from the party, and the mirage of domestic bliss, all delivered in Barnett’s trademark chill drawl. “Now we’ve got that percolator / Never made a latte greater / I’m saving 23 dollars a week,” she sings on “Depreston,” one of the record’s many standout tracks. Now, countless tours, one Kurt Vile collab album, and a lifetime of socio-political turmoil later, Barnett’s latest,  , seems to build on that foundation while heaping the weight of the last three years on its maker’s shoulders. The record opens with “Hopefulessness,” a slow-building number that plainly lays out her thesis statement: “Take your broken heart / Turn it into art,” she sings as her guitar grows more insistent. That song ends with the screech of a kettle whistle and, in a lot of ways,   is the sound of Barnett reaching her boiling point. On “Nameless, Faceless,” Barnett echoes the #MeToo movement, loosely adapting the Margaret Atwood quote “Men are scared that women will laugh at them / Women are scared that men will kill them” around a line about how Barnett walks through the park at night while holding her keys between her fingers. It’s followed by the feedback-filled “I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch,” in which Barnett channels her inner Karen O to wail that she can “only put up with so much shit.” Ultimately, though, it’s the way Barnett juxtaposes these moments of colossal rage that makes   so monumental. “Need A Little Time” offers a refreshingly honest look at intimacy and self-doubt. “Help Your Self” delivers a message of hopeful empowerment almost in spite of itself. And then there’s the sprawling album closer “Sunday Roast,” which feels most akin to her work with Vile, and features what is maybe the record’s most poignant line. “Some kindness goes around / Some kind of backfires,” Barnett sings, revealing just how revelatory simple goodness can be—especially when it feels like the world is crumbling around you.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

The album’s brilliance stems from her ability to navigate these two emotional poles with grace, highlighting the strange ways in which grief can manifest itself.

Burns’s songs don’t follow conventional structures, and their open-ended nature reflects her tendency to ask more questions than give answers. “Oh, won’t some otherworldly joy / Please step on in?” she pleads in one of the album’s most climactic moments, on closing track “Where Do I Begin.” Steeped in pain, it’s hard to not also hear, in the line, Burns’s sheer awe of the world around her.", "genre": ["Folk"]}

Since leaving Warp Records in 2011 after  , Herren has begun to pull back the layers, examining the details of what makes his music so enthralling, extracting small pieces from the mix and allowing that minutiae to become the focal point. His latest LP,  , is built on this idea, and its songs consist of patient loops, beautiful melodies, and meditative moments of quiet. The album begins with “New Salad Intro,” a song where vocal snippets are screwed and manipulated, cymbals are washed in ambient noise, and buzzing synths never quite bubble above the surface. The song is a multitude of pieces, and a sign of things to come. And while the song never fully coheres beyond this collection of disparate noises,  is at its best when otherwise unrelated ideas find harmony amongst each other. “Late to the Party” pairs a sweetly lilting melody with harsh piano stabs, looping back upon itself again and again. The result is surprisingly peaceful, a subtle consideration of just how many parts are needed to make a whole. “Gravure” opens with ominous tones and grave percussion before diving into Shlohmo-esque synth manipulations. “The World is Bigger” is the album’s longest and most boisterous track, yet it doesn’t seek out terrain too far past its origin point. And while  may be Prefuse 73’s simplest album to date, it’s in this stripped-down aesthetic that Herren gets to the heart of what the project is all about. The elements are spread across a canvas for the listener to take in individually, one by one.

{"album": "The Long Sleep", "artist": "Jenny Hval", "description": "At the 2:20 mark of  ’s opening track, “Spells,” Jenny Hval’s voice rises from an otherwise calm, steady jazz-pop base. The simple swing of the music recalls  era   or David Bowie’s “Absolute Beginners.” “You will not be awake for long / You won’t have to wait for long,” sings Hval, initiating a subtle yet anthemic refrain that repeats throughout the track, sometimes mutating with respect to pronoun (“you” vs. “we”) and whether her voice is single or multi-tracked. Like “Absolute Beginners,” “Spells” ends up feeling both triumphant and intimate, both timeless and, in its rhythmic consistency, endless. Hval doubles this sense of endlessness, too, by having her refrain pour over into the second song of the EP. There, her now-familiar vocal line serves as a hinge between two distinct compositional segments (a sparse piano ballad and a jittering mass of vocals), facilitating a conversation between them. Conversation has long been central to Hval’s music. Many of her songs stage actual or imagined dialogues between human characters or broader entities. Yet where previous Hval releases, such as 2016’s  , employ direct modes of address—loaded language, narrative specificity, audio-visual doubling—  presents conversations that, like the music itself, are a little more spaced out and abstract. There are “you”s and “me”s, but the nature of their relationships tends to drift into the atmosphere, like Hval’s soaring voice on “Spells.” They exist—to use a lyric from that song—“in the smallest great unknown.” On the short, spoken final track, Hval appears to analyze her own songwriting approach: “There is nothing useful in the way we define you or me in this context,” she says, later adding, “It’s not in the words.” Indeed, the interactions throughout the EP are open-ended, staged within the recordings—the multi-tracked vocals, track two’s sparring ideas—rather than in the text. The EP’s nearly 11-minute title track removes language altogether. Its few vocalizations are quiet, wordless, fragmented, floating in a formless and diverse stream of sound: the most palpable aural manifestation of that “great unknown.”", "genre": ["Experimental", "Folk"]}
{"album": "Sink", "artist": "Sudan Archives", "description": "A few years ago, Brittney Parks—aka Sudan Archives—left her parents’ home in Cincinnati and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music. Parks had taken up the violin in the fourth grade and, perhaps bolstered by a lack of extended formal training, she’s used her intuition to craft an elegant and abstract style of play. In an interview with the  , Sudan Archives described the way she plays violin as decidedly “un-Western,” recounting the inspiration she found in the folk sounds of Sudanese players. She often forgoes the use of a bow, sometimes slapping her instrument like a djembe drum, strumming it like a banjo, or plucking a riff with her fingers. In 2017, after cautiously exploring the vibrant and amorphous L.A. beat scene, Parks released her debut EP for Stones Throw Records. On  , she grafted her violin style onto a batch of glitchy, soulful electronic tracks, and sang on all of them. Her new EP,  , continues the lo-fi electronic folk awakening she explored on her debut and extends the scope of her songwriting. Many of the songs on   are muggy, but the title track sounds like it’s literally underwater. Cavernous, echoey synths float and flutter while Parks’s singing voice is shrouded in breathy distortion. “Nont For Sale” is the lead single and obvious album centerpiece. It’s boomy, spaced-out R&B on which elastic staccato trickles above the beat. Despite her upending of a classical instrument, the artist’s music is held together by a strong center of gravity. She sounds remarkably assertive and radically independent. “This is my light, don’t block the sun,” Parks declares in a sneering taunt. “This is my seat, can’t you tell?” The song “Beautiful Mistake” sounds quaint by comparison, with a tick-tock drum unraveling in a crooked gallop while Parks plucks a tip-toeing riff. “  describes the way I want my music to make you feel,” Parks says in an artist’s statement about her new EP. “It’s inspired by my love of fluidity, movement of jellyfish, and water.” For an artist still discovering her talents, Parks sounds comfortable gliding from one sound to the next.  ", "genre": ["Experimental", "Soul", "Folk"]}

On 2013’s  , the Portland-based artist explored folk music history through takes on vintage tunes like “Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “Will The Circle Be Unbroken.” Two years ago, she released  , her soundtrack to an imaginary sci-fi western. Anderson seemed to thrive with these self-imposed boundaries, resulting in textured and often stirring work. For her sixth full-length  , Anderson removes any and all restrictions, and soars even higher as a result. The 10 original compositions are a sundry mix of mood and styles, where the vertiginous blending of multiple guitar lines on “Slow Ascent” fits perfectly between the minimalist skronk of “Angel’s Rest” and the reverb-heavy ramble of album opener “Pulse.” Anderson also opens her process to some additional instrumentation, like the quiet electric piano that makes its presence known on the stinging ballad “Lament.” That piano bobs up again on the album’s closing song “Lift,” joined by a steady pattern played on a requinto jarocho, a guitar-shaped instrument originating from Mexico. Those little inclusions may not seem monumental. But for Anderson, whose domain has typically remained in the finger-picked guitars and lap steel, her decision to bring in new timbres and details into her sound is the mark of an artist who knows that unless she pushes herself to evolve, her work will surely stagnate and molder.

The New York trio’s fourth album,  , builds on the off-the-cuff humor that populated their first three, piling on sung/screamed lyrics and sour guitar chords with an irreverent glee. It’s the longest record they’ve ever released, and also their most considered—for the first time, Palberta actually edited their songs after laying them to tape. But that doesn’t diminish the feeling of immediacy that has become the group’s trademark. The three women of Palberta—Ani Ivry-Block, Lily Konigsberg, and Nina Ryser—all sing, often at once, on the band’s songs, which reinforces the impression of a tight-knit group of friends hanging out and goofing off. Despite the surface levity, several tracks on the record weave in a little darkness. “Who are you when you have nothing?” they sing on “Jaws’ Return”; on the slow, nearly mournful “Momentous Space-Up,” they bemoan “having a dream drop.” But the album’s most addictive songs tend to be the ones where the tempo and the snark run high. “Sound of the Beat,” with its repeated “heys!” and drifting guitar lines, somehow lands in the exact middle between The Go-Go’s “We Got the Beat” and the  theme song, while album closer “Heaven to Rock n’ Roll” pokes fun at the artifice of Palberta’s technical status as a rock group. “Satellite! / Coming from the heavens of rock ‘n’ roll!” they yelp over a jagged bassline, simultaneously highlighting the silliness of their dude-dominated genre and establishing them as part of it. Rock, after all, tends to be best when it’s loose and fun, not overly polished or fixated on virtuosity. By leaving the seams of their sound exposed, Palberta make music that’s as inviting as it is invigorating.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}

While compilations are nothing new for Erased Tapes, this release is more of a collaboration than a simple collection of unrelated tracks. Contributing artists recorded their songs in Berlin’s analog Vox-Ton Studio, sharing space and instruments, which makes for exciting cross-pollination. Erased Tapes is known for housing brilliant piano-based artists, and this album makes a lovely introduction to them. Whether it’s  ’s hypnotic thrum, Dustin O’Halloran’s crisp chords (with “A Winged Victory for the Sullen”), or  ’s felt-muffled ballads, there are many testimonies to the new potential of this old instrument. The electronica of Erased Tapes is clean and complex, sharing more attributes with contemporary classical music than with techno.   (also of  ) opens the album with “Brutal Moderna.” The song was recorded after the U.S. presidential election in 2016, and features   stuttering out the day’s headlines on top of Naqvi’s beats and synths.  ’ “Ritual Song” alternates hesitation and dramatic quickening to great effect.  ’s “Inori” delivers the most avant-garde track of the lot, complete with breathing, operatic vocals, and seagull cries. Noit is one of two credited women on the 20 tracks here, mirroring the roster as a whole. (Heather Woods Broderick contributes vocals to brother Peter Broderick’s song but isn’t credited in the track listing.) Especially given the label’s commitment to innovation and collaboration, some gender diversity would be welcome fuel for the next 10 years.

On  , Khemmis sound tighter than ever, courtesy of the improved and searing solos, and a stronger integration of aggressive vocals alongside clean and soaring ones. Second track “Isolation” opens with a galloping assault, and its vocal hooks are built for singalongs; the guitars weave their way down wildly varying yet occasionally intertwining paths. “How could I pray for salvation / When I’m the only mourner yet to grieve?” hardly sounds fun on paper, but shouted along, it becomes surprisingly exultant. “Flesh To Nothing” ascends to grand heights with heavily-layered vocals that alternate between growled and triumphant, peaking with a massive solo after a slow-building tremolo section. The growled vocals do occasionally misfire—“Maw Of Time” is somewhat grating—but the integration is far stronger here than it was on their two previous records.  ends on a subdued note with the mournful, nine-and-a-half minute “From Ruin,” the most straightforward epic-doom song of the lot.

In the four years that followed, he’s split his time between working as a  , and working out his demons over intimate keyboard arrangements.   brings the two Zhangs together, digitally reworking “failed” (in his own words) saxophone compositions into brooding oceanic ambience that’s been processed out of recognition. Opening track “Pierrot” scatters mournful notes from the man’s horn into a cavernous echo chamber, while lonely piano chords bristle underneath. It’s a compelling facade, Zhang playing up his role as the lonely sufferer namechecked in the track’s title, splitting his turmoil into scattered sax. Elsewhere on the record, Zhang moves even more slowly, recalling Popol Vuh at their keyboard choir peak. Zhang has been performing under his own name for four years now, and the music he’s created feels more honest; spiritual panic is now firmly at the core of Zhang’s solo work. His own mixed background—coming in some way from Canada, Taiwan, and the U.S. all at once—has already been a key driver for the artist, but a few years of traveling the world and improvising with new instrumentation now make it seem as if he’s left planet Earth behind altogether.

Yet on her first release for a label,  , the 18-year-old, self-produced Los Angeles musician hana vu throws caution to the wind, dipping her toes into murky R&B in the vein of King Krule (“Cool”), woozy jangle-pop (“426”), and even writing one of the best post-rock gloom jams this side of Interpol’s  (“Shallow”). Threaded through the entire project is vu’s remarkable knack for melody; armed with a dazzlingly confident voice, these songs are all clearly  , even if they explore radically different musical territory. Not only is vu assured, but she tackles questions of self-reliance and emotional insularity with a maturity far beyond that of your average high school student. There are nods to dissolving romance; on “Crying on the Subway” (perhaps the first song to be written about L.A. public transit) for instance, she captures the complex push and pull of ending a doomed relationship, incorporating a slinking bassline and skittish drum machines that magnify the poles of her mixed emotions. Later, on the EP’s title track, she delivers a bold statement of her own independence, backed by nothing but a gravelly guitar figure: “I ran the world / I’ve heard it all / Doesn’t get me very far.” Even though hana vu seems like she’d rather stay within the confines of her room, she’s made clear that she’s eager to tackle a world’s worth of sounds and experiences.", "genre": ["Alternative"]}
{"album": "No Trail and Other Unholy Paths", "artist": "Jaye Jayle", "description": "Guitarist/vocalist Evan Patterson originally formed Jaye Jayle as a minimalist, solo antidote to his main band, the bone-crushing Louisville post-hardcore act Young Widows. Now a quartet augmented by bass, drums, and keyboards, Patterson’s group currently hews closer to the shades-tightly-drawn cinematic stylings of Nick Cave and Mark Lanegan. Produced by David Lynch’s long-time music supervisor, Dean Hurley, Jaye Jayle’s latest full-length,  starts with an instrumental aperitif: “No Trail (Path One)” is driven by overlapping piano (and, later, keyboard) ostinatos that tumble together as if in a clothes dryer. Up next is the hypnotic, dirge-like “No Trail (Path Two).” This song introduces Patterson’s baritone, as stark as spilled black ink pooling on paper, before Emma Ruth Rundle joins in to add even more shade to the vocal fray. “What took you so long?” she whispers, in a tone that’s both conspiratorial and frightened. The rest of   follows the same blueprint of mesmerizing unease. Minor-key guitars add macabre heft to insistent rhythmic pulses, shirred keyboard grooves, and scattered instrumental atmosphere. The clattering backdrop of “Ode To Betsy” echoes that of Bauhaus’ “Bela Lugosi’s Dead”; “Low Again Street” is bookended by foggy, diffracted saxophone; and “As Soon As Night” boasts recurring whirring sounds that resemble a power drill. The album’s emotional and musical highlight, however, is the tension-filled “Marry Us.” Another example of fine vocal interplay between Patterson and Rundle, who are a couple in real life, it’s a searing psychedelic sprawl with well-placed percussion (i.e., raindrop-like beats, devious tambourine shakes) and lyrics smoldering with desire. “Marry us / We don’t need anyone / We don’t need family / Just marry us, now,” Patterson demands. The desperation in his voice increases as he urges that the deed be done “quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly”—words spoken just as loud, crashing guitars surge, as if they’re placing a firm exclamation mark on his exhortation.

As its title suggests, the album is full of songs of both regret and self-doubt, but the group deliver them with some of the strongest power-pop this side of Weezer’s  . The New Zealand quartet—who studied jazz together in Auckland—have a penchant for writing massive choruses that crash like tidal waves, and their songs are as tightly-wrought as they are relentless. On the belligerent breakup track “Uptown Girl,” frontwoman Elizabeth Stokes calls down the wrath of the gods (and a glass of poisoned wine) on a crummy ex as her band yank her from one full-octane hook to another, emphasizing her own frenzied urge to “drink the whole town dry.” Later, in “You Wouldn’t Like Me,” a sunny doo-wop arrangement and crisp backup vocals serve as a foil for Stokes’s harshest self-indictment: “You wouldn’t like me if you saw what was inside me.” But  isn’t all doom and gloom. Stokes knows that falling in love is a gamble, and on the album’s title track in particular, she acknowledges that it’s better to have loved and lost than to be, as she deftly puts it, “happy unhappy.” The Beths know how to dig up both the wounds and the sugar-rush that accompany new romance; on their debut they do so with exceptional gusto.", "genre": ["Alternative", "indie"]}

The debut studio LP from  —aka Oakland, California’s Megan Mitchell—spins operatic whirlpools of sound into oceans of whispery drones. Urgency is in very short supply here; the predominant vibe here is drift. At times, it can be difficult to understand what Mitchell is actually  ; her diction is often overcome by feeling, and her malleable voice is one among many of the album’s sonic colors. On “Malaise Vague,” her voice is brought to the fore. The instrumental itself is drawn back and minimized, and there’s a sadness to her tone that feels like Enya in mourning. “Soporific Return,” by contrast, is lighter, with Mitchell’s languorous enunciations swimming through echoing, bell-like electronics. The tremulous “To Ward” is a vigorous remix or two away from being something that could fit comfortably on a playlist alongside  ’s  an immersive, trippy album in its own right. Standout “Render Arcane” is buoyed by a fleet, intricate percussive matrix that nudges  , however briefly, towards the world of house music, suggesting one avenue the project could take in the future. Another possibility turns up on album closer “Intent to Vacate,” where the backdrop darkens into something rhythmic, monstrous, and groaning, while Mitchell’s voice, strident and strong, pulls away.

Fresh’s piano playing ranges from sparse and tentative, as on lead single “Deep in the Big,” to rippling and expansive, as on “Boxing Day.” Other tracks introduce sleepy organ, while the closing “Jonah’s Dream” shelves keyboard instruments altogether to hang on folky acoustic guitar.

The lyrics aren’t always clear, but Fresh takes a devastating, sigh-like approach to every track that pulls the heartstrings, even when the meaning is left vague. The wistful “Interstate,” which recalls the aching, piano-centered tracks of Cat Power’s  , sets Fresh’s voice at a wavering remove without sacrificing emotional resonance. “Zigrid” brings her voice much closer, layering it over rustling percussion and playful effects, while the nearly nine-minute “11, 12, 13” similarly gives the impression of her being right next to us, whispering like a trusted confidant.

Album opener “Geyser” delivers what Mitski does best, pitting layers of organ and flourishes of screeching guitar against her urgent voice. With its groovy ballroom bigness, glammed-up single “Nobody” feels like a nod to the disco ballads that soundtracked late ‘60s films set in Los Angeles or London, decorated with bells and xylophones and opening with a hi-hat rhythm that recalls Stevie Nicks’s “Edge of Seventeen.” The lyrics speak of trying to get through a difficult time: “I don’t want your pity / I just want somebody near me / Guess I’m a coward / I just want to feel alright.” Mitski has always had a flair for drama—on   it was the frantic fighting-for-her-life guitar playing of “My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars”; on   it’s understated choruses and plaintive, organ-like keys.   marks a departure from the angsty devastation of first heartbreak evident on previous records.

Lead singles “Make It Forever” and “Dumb” both maintain the grandness of his previous work; Clanton encases his vocals in echo while layering simple, heavy drum beats and explosive, soaring synth lines to trigger as many sonic climaxes as he can fit. But all that bombast can’t cover the undeniable sense of longing and yearning that permeates the album. “I guess we won’t stop drinking / ‘Cause you’re in the wrong place and I’m in the wrong town,” Clanton murmurs on “Monster,” one of a handful of tracks where he willingly tones down his trademark grandiosity for a moment to express something tender and painful.
